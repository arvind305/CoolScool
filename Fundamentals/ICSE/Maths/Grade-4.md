*Grade 4 mathematics extends number sense to 9,99,999, introduces fractional numbers comprehensively (including equivalent fractions, like-fraction operations, and mixed/improper conversions), and builds fluency in all four operations. Students learn multiples, factors, HCF, and LCM, explore basic geometry including circles and symmetry, and begin working with perimeter and area. The curriculum covers measurement of length, mass, capacity, and time, along with data handling through pictographs and bar graphs.*
