# ICSE Grade 6 Mathematics Syllabus

## 2025-2026 Academic Year

**Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) - Official Curriculum**

The ICSE Mathematics syllabus for Grade 6 strengthens and extends learners' understanding of numbers, operations, fractions, decimals, integers, basic algebra, geometry, mensuration, and data handling. The curriculum aims to build a solid bridge between primary mathematics and the more formal structures of middle school mathematics, with a strong focus on reasoning, problem-solving, and real-life applications.
