# ICSE Grade 8 Mathematics Syllabus
## 2025-2026 Academic Year

**Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) - Official Curriculum**

The ICSE Mathematics syllabus for Grade 8 consolidates rational numbers and algebra and significantly extends geometry, mensuration, commercial arithmetic, statistics and introductory coordinate ideas, preparing students directly for ICSE Class 9.
