# ICSE Grade 3 Science (EVS) Syllabus
## 2025-2026 Academic Year

**Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) - Official Curriculum**

The ICSE Science syllabus for Grade 3 (Environmental Studies/EVS) builds upon the foundational concepts introduced in earlier grades. At this level, students begin to explore more detailed concepts about the human body, plants, animals, and the physical world around them. The curriculum emphasizes observation, classification, and understanding cause-and-effect relationships in nature.

- Our body is made up of different systems that work together
- Each system has a special job to keep us healthy

**Digestive System**
- Organs of digestion: mouth, food pipe (esophagus), stomach, intestines
- Journey of food through the body
- How food is broken down into smaller pieces
- How our body gets energy from food

**Respiratory System**
- Organs of breathing: nose, windpipe (trachea), lungs
- Breathing in (inhale) and breathing out (exhale)
- Oxygen goes in, carbon dioxide comes out
- Why we need to breathe

**Circulatory System (Introduction)**
- Heart: the pumping machine
- Heart pumps blood all around the body
