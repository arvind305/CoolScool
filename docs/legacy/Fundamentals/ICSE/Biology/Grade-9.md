## Theme 13: Environment and Ecology
### Content

**Ecosystem**
- Definition: community of living organisms and their environment
- Types:
  - Terrestrial: forests, grasslands, deserts
  - Aquatic: marine, freshwater

**Components of Ecosystem**

**Abiotic Components**
- Temperature
- Light
- Water
- Air
- Soil
- Minerals

**Biotic Components**
- Producers: autotrophs, photosynthesis
- Consumers: heterotrophs
  - Primary: herbivores
  - Secondary: carnivores
  - Tertiary: top predators
- Decomposers: bacteria, fungi

**Food Chain**
- Linear sequence of energy transfer
- Example: Grass -> Grasshopper -> Frog -> Snake -> Hawk

**Food Web**
- Interconnected food chains
- More realistic representation
- Stability of ecosystem

**Ecological Pyramids**
- Pyramid of energy: always upright
- Pyramid of biomass: usually upright
- Pyramid of numbers: can be inverted
- 10% law: energy transfer efficiency

**Biogeochemical Cycles**

**Carbon Cycle**
- Photosynthesis: CO2 fixed into organic matter
- Respiration: organic matter oxidized, CO2 released
- Decomposition: releases CO2
- Combustion: fossil fuels release CO2
- Human impact: increased atmospheric CO2

**Nitrogen Cycle**
- Nitrogen fixation: N2 to ammonia
  - Biological: bacteria (Rhizobium)
  - Industrial: Haber process
  - Lightning
- Nitrification: ammonia to nitrates
- Assimilation: plants absorb nitrates
- Ammonification: decomposition releases ammonia
- Denitrification: nitrates to N2

**Water Cycle**
- Evaporation: water to vapor
- Transpiration: from plants
- Condensation: vapor to clouds
- Precipitation: rain, snow
- Runoff and groundwater

**Oxygen Cycle**
- Photosynthesis: produces O2
- Respiration: consumes O2
- Combustion: consumes O2
- Ozone formation: O3 in atmosphere

**Environmental Pollution**

**Air Pollution**
- Causes: vehicles, industries, burning
- Pollutants: CO, SO2, NOx, particulates
- Effects: respiratory diseases, acid rain
- Control: catalytic converters, scrubbers

**Water Pollution**
- Causes: industrial waste, sewage, agricultural runoff
- Effects: eutrophication, death of aquatic life
- Control: treatment plants, regulations

**Soil Pollution**
- Causes: pesticides, industrial waste, plastics
- Effects: loss of fertility, contamination
- Control: proper waste disposal, organic farming

**Noise Pollution**
- Sources: traffic, industries, loudspeakers
- Effects: hearing loss, stress, cardiovascular problems
- Control: sound barriers, regulations

**Biodiversity**
- Definition: variety of life forms
- Levels:
  - Genetic diversity
  - Species diversity
  - Ecosystem diversity
- Importance: ecological, economic, aesthetic

**Threats to Biodiversity**
- Habitat loss: deforestation, urbanization
- Overexploitation: overfishing, hunting
