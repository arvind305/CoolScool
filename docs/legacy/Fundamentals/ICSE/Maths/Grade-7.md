# ICSE Grade 7 Mathematics Syllabus

## 2025-2026 Academic Year

**Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) - Official
Curriculum**

The ICSE Mathematics syllabus for Grade 7 deepens students'
understanding of numbers, rational numbers, algebra, geometry,
mensuration, commercial arithmetic, and data
handling. It strengthens the bridge between upper
primary and pre-ICSE (Classes 9--10) by formalising arithmetic skills
and introducing more abstract reasoning.
