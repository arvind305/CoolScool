- Diffuse (irregular) reflection: from rough surfaces, no clear image

**Terms Used in Reflection**
- Incident ray: ray of light falling on a surface
- Reflected ray: ray of light bouncing off the surface
- Normal: perpendicular to the surface at point of incidence
- Angle of incidence (i): angle between incident ray and normal
- Angle of reflection (r): angle between reflected ray and normal

**Laws of Reflection**
- First law: Incident ray, reflected ray, and normal lie in the same plane
- Second law: Angle of incidence equals angle of reflection (i = r)

**Plane Mirrors**
