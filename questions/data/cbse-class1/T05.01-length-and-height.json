    "text": "Length tells us how long something is. Height tells us how tall something is. We can compare objects to see which is longer or shorter, taller or shorter. We can also measure length using things like hand spans, footsteps, or pencil lengths. These are called non-standard units.",
    "rules": [
      "Longer means more length; shorter means less length.",
      "Taller means more height; shorter means less height.",
      "We compare by placing objects side by side or end to end.",
