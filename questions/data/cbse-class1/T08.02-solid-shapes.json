    "text": "Solid shapes are 3D shapes that have length, width, and height. Unlike flat shapes, you can hold solid shapes in your hand. The main solid shapes are: cube (like a dice), cuboid (like a brick), cylinder (like a tin can), sphere (like a ball), and cone (like an ice cream cone). Some solids can roll, some can stack, and some can do both.",
    "rules": [
      "A sphere is round like a ball — it can roll.",
      "A cube has 6 flat square faces — it can stack.",
      "A cuboid has 6 flat rectangular faces — it can stack.",
      "A cylinder has 2 flat circular faces and a curved surface — it can roll and stack.",
      "A cone has 1 flat circular face and a pointed top — it can roll on its side."
