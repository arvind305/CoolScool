    "text": "Life processes are the basic functions performed by living organisms to maintain life. These include nutrition, respiration, transportation, and excretion. Nutrition involves the intake of food and its conversion into energy. Autotrophic nutrition (photosynthesis) is carried out by green plants using carbon dioxide and water in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll. Heterotrophic organisms depend on other organisms for food. Respiration is the process of breaking down glucose to release energy, occurring as aerobic (with oxygen) or anaerobic (without oxygen) respiration. Transportation in plants involves xylem (water and minerals) and phloem (food), while in animals the circulatory system with heart and blood vessels performs this role. Excretion is the removal of metabolic waste products, carried out by the kidneys in humans through the formation of urine.",

      "Autotrophic nutrition: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ (requires sunlight and chlorophyll).",
      "Heterotrophic nutrition includes holozoic, saprophytic, and parasitic modes.",
