  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Control and coordination in living organisms is achieved through the nervous system and hormonal (endocrine) system in animals, and through phytohormones in plants. The nervous system uses neurons to transmit electrical impulses rapidly. A neuron consists of a cell body, dendrites (receive signals), and an axon (transmits signals). Reflex actions are quick, involuntary responses controlled by the spinal cord through reflex arcs. The human brain has three main parts: cerebrum (thinking, memory), cerebellum (balance, coordination), and medulla oblongata (involuntary actions). Plants respond to stimuli through tropic movements (directional, e.g., phototropism) and nastic movements (non-directional). Plant hormones like auxin, gibberellin, cytokinin, abscisic acid, and ethylene regulate growth and responses. The endocrine system uses chemical messengers called hormones, secreted by ductless glands directly into the blood.",

Once blood sugar returns to normal levels, the reduced sugar level signals the pancreas to decrease insulin production. This self-regulating cycle is a classic example of feedback control.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Sneezing and blinking are reflex actions. Sweating is a thermoregulation response. The insulin-blood sugar cycle demonstrates a true feedback mechanism where the output (lowered blood sugar) feeds back to regulate the input (insulin secretion)."
