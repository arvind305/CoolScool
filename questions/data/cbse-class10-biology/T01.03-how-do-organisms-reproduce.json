    "text": "Reproduction is the biological process by which organisms produce offspring, ensuring the continuity of species. It involves DNA copying, which introduces variations essential for evolution. Asexual reproduction involves a single parent and produces genetically identical offspring. Methods include binary fission (Amoeba), budding (Hydra, yeast), fragmentation (Spirogyra), regeneration (Planaria), spore formation (Rhizopus), and vegetative propagation (potato, rose). Sexual reproduction involves two parents and produces offspring with genetic variation through the fusion of male and female gametes. In flowering plants, the flower is the reproductive organ — stamens produce pollen (male) and carpels contain ovules (female). Pollination, fertilization, and seed/fruit formation complete the cycle. In humans, the male reproductive system produces sperm (testes) and the female system produces ova (ovaries). Fertilization occurs in the fallopian tube, and the embryo develops in the uterus.",

      "In flowers: stamen (anther + filament) is male; carpel/pistil (stigma + style + ovary) is female.",
      "Pollination transfers pollen from anther to stigma; fertilization occurs when pollen tube reaches ovule.",
      "In humans: sperm + ovum → zygote → embryo → foetus; placenta nourishes the developing embryo."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Seeds are highly significant: they contain the embryo (next generation plant), endosperm/cotyledons (food reserves for germination), and a tough seed coat (testa) that protects against adverse conditions. Seeds can remain dormant until conditions are favourable and can be dispersed to new locations.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Seeds are extremely important in plant reproduction. They are not formed during asexual reproduction. While some seeds are eaten by animals, that is not their primary significance. Seeds protect the embryo, store food, and enable dispersal."

        { "id": "D", "text": "Because the embryo develops outside the uterus" }
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Unlike eggs of birds or reptiles that have stored yolk, the human embryo develops inside the uterus and requires a continuous supply of oxygen, glucose, amino acids, and other nutrients from the mother's blood. The placenta provides this connection, and waste products (CO₂, urea) are also removed through it. This is essential for the 9-month development period.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The embryo cannot produce its own food and definitely needs nourishment. It develops inside the uterus, not outside. The placenta is essential because the human embryo has no stored food and depends entirely on the mother for nutrition and waste removal."

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation_correct": "This is true. During DNA replication, the copying process is not always 100% accurate. Small errors (mutations) can occur, leading to variations in the offspring. While most variations are minor, some can be significant and may be advantageous, neutral, or harmful for survival.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement is true. DNA copying always has a small margin of error. These errors create variations that are the basis of evolution and the diversity of life. Without these variations, species could not adapt to changing environments."

      "explanation_correct": "This is true. Oral contraceptive pills contain synthetic hormones (usually estrogen and progesterone) that prevent ovulation by disrupting the normal hormonal cycle. Without the release of an egg from the ovary, fertilization cannot occur.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement is true. Oral pills are a hormonal method of contraception that prevents the ovary from releasing an egg. They alter the hormonal balance to suppress ovulation, making pregnancy impossible."

      "explanation_correct": "Sporangia (singular: sporangium) are the round, blob-like structures at the tips of the upright hyphae of Rhizopus (bread mould). They contain numerous spores. When the sporangium bursts, spores are released into the air and can germinate into new organisms under favourable conditions.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'sporangia'. These are the spore-bearing structures of Rhizopus. Each sporangium contains hundreds of spores that are dispersed by air currents for reproduction."

Examples include papaya and watermelon flowers. In contrast, a bisexual flower contains both stamens and carpels (e.g., hibiscus, mustard).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'unisexual'. Such flowers are either male (with stamens only, called staminate flowers) or female (with carpels only, called pistillate flowers). Corn, papaya, and cucumber have unisexual flowers."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'zygote'. It is the first cell of a new organism, containing genetic material from both parents. In humans, the zygote forms in the fallopian tube and then implants in the uterus to develop further."
