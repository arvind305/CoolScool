    "text": "Heredity is the transmission of traits from parents to offspring through genes. Gregor Mendel, the father of genetics, studied inheritance patterns using pea plants and established fundamental laws. In a monohybrid cross (Tt x Tt), the phenotypic ratio is 3:1 (dominant:recessive). In a dihybrid cross, the phenotypic ratio is 9:3:3:1. Traits are controlled by genes present on chromosomes. Sex in humans is determined by sex chromosomes: females have XX and males have XY. Evolution is the gradual change in inherited characteristics of a population over generations. Evidence includes homologous organs, analogous organs, and fossils. Natural selection, as proposed by Darwin, drives evolution by favouring organisms with advantageous traits. Speciation occurs through geographical isolation and genetic drift. Evolution is not progress from lower to higher forms but adaptation to environments.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Eyes evolved in stages: from simple light-sensitive spots (in some flatworms) to cup-shaped eyes (providing directional information) to pinhole camera eyes (in nautilus) to lens eyes (in octopus and vertebrates). Each intermediate stage provided a survival advantage, making evolution of the next stage possible through natural selection.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Eyes did not appear fully formed at once. Many organisms have eyes, not just humans. Complex organs can evolve through gradual stages. Each stage of eye evolution provided a survival benefit — even a simple light-sensing patch is better than no light detection at all."

So sons are either XY (normal vision) or XᶜY (colour-blind), each with 50% probability. Therefore, 50% of sons would be colour-blind.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Sons receive their X chromosome from the mother (who is XXᶜ). Half the sons will get X (normal) and half will get Xᶜ (colour-blind). Since the Y from the father does not carry the gene for colour vision, 50% of sons will be colour-blind."

Inherited traits can be passed to offspring; acquired traits cannot.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is '1:2:1'. From the Punnett square of Tt x Tt: one-fourth TT, one-half Tt, one-fourth tt. The genotypic ratio (1:2:1) differs from the phenotypic ratio (3:1) because both TT and Tt show the dominant phenotype."
