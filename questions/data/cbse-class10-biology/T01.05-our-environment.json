    "text": "An ecosystem is a self-sustaining system of living organisms (biotic components) interacting with the non-living environment (abiotic components). Biotic components include producers (green plants that make food through photosynthesis), consumers (herbivores, carnivores, omnivores), and decomposers (bacteria, fungi that break down dead matter). Energy flows through an ecosystem via food chains and food webs. At each trophic level, only 10% of the energy is transferred to the next level (10% law). Biological magnification refers to the increase in concentration of non-biodegradable substances (like pesticides) at each trophic level. The ozone layer protects life on Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. Ozone depletion, primarily caused by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), leads to increased UV radiation reaching Earth. Waste can be biodegradable (broken down by natural processes) or non-biodegradable (persists in the environment).",
