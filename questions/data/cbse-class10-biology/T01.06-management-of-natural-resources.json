    "text": "Natural resources are the materials and components found in the natural environment that are useful to humans. Their management is essential for sustainable development. The three R's (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) and the broader five R's (Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repurpose, Recycle) guide responsible resource use. Forests are biodiversity hotspots and must be conserved through the participation of all stakeholders — local communities, forest departments, and industries. The Chipko movement is a famous conservation effort where villagers hugged trees to prevent deforestation. Water management through dams, rainwater harvesting, and watershed management is critical for ensuring water availability. Coal and petroleum are non-renewable fossil fuels formed over millions of years. Their conservation through reduced consumption and use of alternative energy sources is essential for sustainable development.",

Renewable alternatives (solar, wind, hydro) are sustainable and cleaner.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "If fossil fuels were exhausted, the consequences would be catastrophic: most electricity generation (coal-based power plants) would halt; transportation (cars, planes, ships dependent on petroleum) would stop; industries using fossil fuels as raw materials would close; heating in cold regions would be affected. This is why developing renewable energy alternatives is urgent.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Fossil fuel depletion would affect all sectors, not just vehicles. They will eventually be exhausted at current consumption rates. The impacts would be severe and widespread unless alternative energy sources are developed in time."

      "options": [
        { "id": "A", "text": "Because groundwater is cleaner" },
        { "id": "B", "text": "Because groundwater does not evaporate, provides steady supply, does not displace people, and is accessible locally" },

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Groundwater storage has several advantages over dam storage: (1) no evaporation losses (dam reservoirs lose significant water to evaporation), (2) no displacement of communities, (3) no submergence of forest land, (4) provides a steady, decentralised water supply accessible locally, (5) natural filtration by soil improves water quality, and (6) lower maintenance costs.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Groundwater is not always cleaner (it can be contaminated). Dams are not always dangerous but have trade-offs. Groundwater is not unlimited — it can be over-extracted. The advantages are: no evaporation, no displacement, local availability, and natural purification."

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation_correct": "This is true. Trees absorb CO₂ during photosynthesis. When forests are cut down: (1) fewer trees remain to absorb CO₂, and (2) the carbon stored in the trees is released back into the atmosphere when the wood decomposes or is burned. Both effects increase atmospheric CO₂, accelerating global warming.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement is true. Forests act as carbon sinks. Deforestation removes these sinks and releases stored carbon, doubling the effect on atmospheric CO₂ levels."

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation_correct": "This is true. Natural gas (mainly methane) is considered a cleaner fuel than coal because when burned, it produces less carbon dioxide per unit of energy, negligible sulphur dioxide (so no acid rain), very low particulate matter, and no ash. However, it still produces CO₂ and is a fossil fuel, so it is not a permanent solution.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement is true. Natural gas produces about 50% less CO₂ than coal per unit of energy. It also produces far less SO₂, particulates, and no ash. While cleaner than coal, it is still a fossil fuel with environmental impacts."

Forests are among the most biodiverse ecosystems on Earth.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'biodiversity'. It includes diversity at three levels: genes, species, and ecosystems. Conserving biodiversity is essential because all organisms are interconnected in the web of life."

Managing catchment areas through soil conservation and afforestation is essential for maintaining water resources.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'catchment'. A catchment area defines the boundary within which all rainfall eventually reaches a specific water body. Watershed management involves managing the entire catchment area for sustainable water use."

      "correct_answer": "carbonisation",
      "explanation_correct": "Carbonisation is the slow process by which dead plant material is converted into carbon-rich coal over millions of years. Layers of dead vegetation were buried under sediment, subjected to increasing heat and pressure, gradually losing moisture and other volatile components until mostly carbon remained. The stages are: peat → lignite → bituminous coal → anthracite.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'carbonisation'. It describes the geological process of coal formation from ancient plant matter. The progressive increase in carbon content transforms organic matter through stages: peat (60% carbon) to anthracite (95% carbon) over millions of years."
