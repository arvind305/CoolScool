    "text": "A chemical reaction occurs when substances undergo a chemical change to form new substances with different properties. Chemical reactions can be identified by changes such as change in colour, evolution of gas, change in temperature, change in state, or formation of a precipitate. A chemical equation is a symbolic representation of a chemical reaction using formulae and symbols. A balanced chemical equation has an equal number of atoms of each element on both sides, obeying the law of conservation of mass. Chemical reactions are classified into combination (two or more substances form one product), decomposition (one substance breaks into two or more), displacement (a more reactive element replaces a less reactive one), and double displacement (exchange of ions). Oxidation is the gain of oxygen or loss of hydrogen, while reduction is the loss of oxygen or gain of hydrogen. Corrosion (e.g., rusting) and rancidity are effects of oxidation in daily life.",

      "A chemical reaction produces new substances with different properties.",

      "Exothermic reactions release heat; endothermic reactions absorb heat.",
      "Oxidation is gain of oxygen or loss of hydrogen; reduction is the reverse.",

      "explanation_correct": "H2S is oxidised because it loses hydrogen (H2S loses H to become S). Cl2 is reduced because it gains hydrogen (Cl2 gains H to become 2HCl). This is a redox reaction where hydrogen is transferred from H2S to Cl2.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Cl2 is not oxidised (B) because it gains hydrogen, which is reduction. Both cannot be oxidised (C) or both reduced (D) because in a redox reaction, one substance must be oxidised while the other is reduced. H2S loses hydrogen (oxidation) and Cl2 gains hydrogen (reduction)."

      "explanation_correct": "Nitrogen is used to flush food packets because it is an inert (unreactive) gas. By filling the packet with nitrogen, oxygen is removed, preventing the oxidation of fats and oils that causes rancidity. Nitrogen itself does not react with the food.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Nitrogen does not add taste (A) because it is an inert, odourless, and tasteless gas. It is not an antioxidant (B) — antioxidants are chemicals that react with oxygen. While it may indirectly help preserve appearance, its primary purpose is not colour preservation (D). The main function is to displace oxygen and prevent oxidation."
