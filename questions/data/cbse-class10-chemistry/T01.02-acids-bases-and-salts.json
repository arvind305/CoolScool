    "text": "Acids are substances that produce hydrogen ions (H+) when dissolved in water, taste sour, and turn blue litmus red. Bases produce hydroxide ions (OH-) in water, taste bitter, feel soapy, and turn red litmus blue. Indicators like litmus, phenolphthalein, and methyl orange help identify acids and bases. Acids react with metals to produce salt and hydrogen gas, with metal carbonates to produce salt, water, and CO2, and with bases to form salt and water (neutralisation). The pH scale measures the strength of acid or base solutions on a scale of 0-14, where 7 is neutral, below 7 is acidic, and above 7 is basic. Common salts like sodium chloride, baking soda, washing soda, bleaching powder, and Plaster of Paris have important industrial and household applications.",
    "rules": [
      "Acids produce H+ ions in water; bases produce OH- ions in water.",
      "pH scale ranges from 0 to 14; pH 7 is neutral, <7 is acidic, >7 is basic.",

      "Baking soda (NaHCO3) is used in antacids, baking, and fire extinguishers.",
      "Washing soda (Na2CO3.10H2O) is used in cleaning, softening water, and glass manufacture.",

      "explanation_correct": "Turmeric is a natural indicator. In a basic medium (soap solution is basic), turmeric changes from yellow to reddish-brown. When rinsed with plain water, the basic condition is removed and the yellow colour returns. This demonstrates that turmeric indicates the presence of a base.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Soap is basic, not acidic (A). Hot water alone does not explain the colour change (C) — it is the basicity of soap. Soap does not bleach turmeric permanently (D) — the brown colour is reversible. The observation is a classic demonstration of turmeric as a natural indicator for bases."

      "explanation_correct": "When a strong acid is diluted with water, the concentration of H+ ions decreases, so the pH increases (becomes less acidic). However, dilution alone can only bring the pH closer to 7 — it can never make the solution basic (pH > 7). The solution remains acidic, just less so. This is different from neutralisation, which uses a base.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Dilution cannot make the pH exceed 7 (A) — that would require adding a base, not water. The pH does change with dilution (C is wrong). Dilution does not convert a strong acid to a weak acid (D) — strength depends on the degree of ionisation, which is a property of the acid itself, not its concentration."

Anhydrous Na2CO3 (soda ash) is a dry powder, whereas washing soda forms large transparent crystals. Heating washing soda removes the water to give anhydrous Na2CO3, not the other way around.",

In dry conditions, acid molecules remain undissociated and cannot show acidic behaviour. For example, dry HCl gas does not change dry litmus colour, but aqueous HCl does.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Water does not act as a catalyst (A) — it actively participates in the ionisation process. Water does not convert the acid to a different compound (C) — the acid simply dissociates into ions. While dilution may make handling safer (D), that is not the reason acids need water for their properties. The fundamental reason is that water enables ionisation to produce H+ ions."

Below pH 5.5, these acids react with and dissolve the calcium phosphate, leading to tooth decay (dental caries).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Bacteria do not directly dissolve enamel (A) — they produce acids that do. Saliva production continues regardless of mouth pH (C).

Once it sets into gypsum, it becomes a hard, useless solid that cannot be reshaped. This is why airtight, moisture-proof storage is essential to maintain its usability.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "POP does not react with CO2 (A) — it reacts with water. It does not simply change colour (C) — it undergoes a chemical change and hardens. It does not dissolve in water vapour (D) — it absorbs the water and solidifies.
