    "text": "Metals are elements that are generally lustrous, malleable, ductile, good conductors of heat and electricity, and sonorous. Non-metals are generally brittle, dull, poor conductors, and non-sonorous. Metals react with oxygen to form basic or amphoteric oxides, while non-metals form acidic oxides. The reactivity series arranges metals in decreasing order of their reactivity. Metals higher in the series can displace metals lower in the series from their salt solutions. Ionic compounds are formed by the transfer of electrons from metals to non-metals, resulting in positively charged cations and negatively charged anions. Metals are extracted from their ores through processes like roasting, calcination, and reduction. Corrosion is prevented by methods such as painting, galvanisation, electroplating, and alloying.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Aluminium (A) requires electrolysis. Iron (B) and zinc (C) need reduction with carbon. Only metals very low in the reactivity series (like mercury and silver) can be obtained by simply heating their ores or oxides."

      "explanation_correct": "Ionic compounds dissolve in water because water molecules, being polar, surround the individual ions. The positive end of water attracts anions and the negative end attracts cations, pulling them apart from the crystal lattice. This process is called hydration or solvation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "There are no covalent bonds to break in ionic compounds (A). Ionic compounds dissociate, not melt, in water (C). Water's boiling point (D) is unrelated to solubility. The polar nature of water allows it to separate and surround the ions."
