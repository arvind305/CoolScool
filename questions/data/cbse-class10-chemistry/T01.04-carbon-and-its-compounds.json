    "text": "Carbon is a versatile element that forms a vast number of compounds due to its tetravalency (ability to form four bonds) and catenation (ability to bond with other carbon atoms to form long chains, branched chains, and rings). Carbon forms covalent bonds by sharing electrons. Saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes) contain only single bonds, while unsaturated hydrocarbons contain double bonds (alkenes) or triple bonds (alkynes). A homologous series is a family of compounds with the same general formula, similar chemical properties, and a constant difference of CH2 between successive members. Functional groups like -OH (alcohol), -COOH (carboxylic acid), and -CHO (aldehyde) determine the chemical properties of organic compounds. Ethanol and ethanoic acid are two important carbon compounds with wide applications. Soaps and detergents are sodium or potassium salts of long-chain fatty acids that clean by forming micelles.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "Carbon forms covalent bonds by sharing electrons. It has 4 valence electrons and needs 4 more to complete its octet. Gaining 4 electrons would make the atom highly negatively charged, and losing 4 would require too much energy. Sharing is the most stable option.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Gaining 4 electrons (A) would give the atom a charge of 4-, which is very unstable. Losing 4 electrons (B) would require enormous energy. Carbon does form bonds (D is wrong). Sharing electrons through covalent bonding is the energetically favourable option for carbon."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Carbon does not have a valency of 2 (A), 3 (B), or 5 (D). With an electronic configuration of 2, 4, carbon has exactly 4 valence electrons, giving it a valency of 4. This tetravalency is key to its versatile bonding."

      "explanation_correct": "Catenation is the ability of carbon to form strong covalent bonds with other carbon atoms, resulting in long straight chains, branched chains, and ring structures. This property is key to the existence of millions of organic compounds.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'catenation'. This unique property of carbon, along with its tetravalency, allows carbon to form an enormous variety of compounds with diverse structures."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'saturated'. Saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes) have no double or triple bonds. When multiple bonds are present, the hydrocarbons are called unsaturated (alkenes or alkynes)."

      "explanation_correct": "Successive members of a homologous series differ by a -CH2- group, which corresponds to a molecular mass difference of 14 u (12 for carbon + 2 for hydrogen). This constant difference is a characteristic feature of all homologous series.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is '-CH2-'. Each successive member in a homologous series has one additional -CH2- unit compared to the previous member. For example, methane (CH4), ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8) each differ by -CH2-."

      "correct_answer": "hydrogenation",
      "explanation_correct": "Hydrogenation is the process of adding hydrogen (H2) to an unsaturated hydrocarbon in the presence of a catalyst (usually nickel or palladium). This converts the unsaturated compound to a saturated one. For example, vegetable oils are hydrogenated to make vanaspati ghee.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'hydrogenation'. This addition reaction converts double/triple bonds to single bonds by adding hydrogen atoms. It is a commercially important process in the food industry."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Ethane (A) would require reduction, not dehydration. Ethanoic acid (C) would require oxidation. Diethyl ether (D) is formed at a lower temperature (140 degrees C). At 170 degrees C with excess H2SO4, dehydration produces ethene."

These free electrons can move between the layers, carrying electric charge. In diamond, all 4 electrons are used in bonding, leaving no free electrons.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Graphite has covalent bonds, not ionic (A). Diamond also has covalent bonds, not metallic (C). Hardness (D) is unrelated to electrical conductivity. The key difference is the presence of free (delocalised) electrons in graphite."

This dual nature enables soap to act as an emulsifying agent between water and oily dirt.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "It does not have two hydrophilic ends (A) or two hydrophobic ends (B) — it has one of each. It is not completely non-polar (D) — the head is polar/ionic. The amphiphilic nature (having both polar and non-polar parts) is what makes soap effective as a cleaning agent."
