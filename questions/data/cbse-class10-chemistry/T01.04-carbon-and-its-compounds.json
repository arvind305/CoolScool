    "text": "Carbon is a versatile element that forms a vast number of compounds due to its tetravalency (ability to form four bonds) and catenation (ability to bond with other carbon atoms to form long chains, branched chains, and rings). Carbon forms covalent bonds by sharing electrons. Saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes) contain only single bonds, while unsaturated hydrocarbons contain double bonds (alkenes) or triple bonds (alkynes). A homologous series is a family of compounds with the same general formula, similar chemical properties, and a constant difference of CH2 between successive members. Functional groups like -OH (alcohol), -COOH (carboxylic acid), and -CHO (aldehyde) determine the chemical properties of organic compounds. Ethanol and ethanoic acid are two important carbon compounds with wide applications. Soaps and detergents are sodium or potassium salts of long-chain fatty acids that clean by forming micelles.",

      "explanation_correct": "Carbon forms covalent bonds by sharing electrons. It has 4 valence electrons and needs 4 more to complete its octet. Gaining 4 electrons would make the atom highly negatively charged, and losing 4 would require too much energy. Sharing is the most stable option.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Gaining 4 electrons (A) would give the atom a charge of 4-, which is very unstable. Losing 4 electrons (B) would require enormous energy. Carbon does form bonds (D is wrong). Sharing electrons through covalent bonding is the energetically favourable option for carbon."
