    "text": "The periodic classification of elements is the systematic arrangement of elements based on their properties. Early attempts include Dobereiner's triads (groups of three elements where the middle element's atomic mass is the average of the other two) and Newlands' Law of Octaves (every eighth element has similar properties, like musical notes). Mendeleev arranged elements by increasing atomic mass and predicted properties of undiscovered elements. The modern periodic table, based on Moseley's work, arranges elements by increasing atomic number (Modern Periodic Law). It has 18 groups (vertical columns) and 7 periods (horizontal rows). Elements in the same group have similar properties due to the same number of valence electrons. Across a period, atomic size decreases and non-metallic character increases. Down a group, atomic size increases and metallic character increases.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Triads, as the name suggests, always contain three elements (not two A, four C, or eight D). Dobereiner identified several such groups of three elements with similar properties where the middle element's mass was the average of the other two."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "When noble gases were discovered, they were accommodated in a new separate group called Group 0 (now Group 18) without disturbing the positions of existing elements. Since noble gases have zero valency (completely filled outermost shells), a new group with no valency was a natural addition.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Noble gases were not placed in Group 1 (A). No elements were removed (B). They were successfully accommodated (D is wrong). The creation of a new group that naturally fit the table structure was a testament to the strength of Mendeleev's classification."

Element B (atomic number 17) is chlorine (Cl) — a non-metal in Group 17 with configuration 2, 8, 7. Sodium (metal) transfers its 1 electron to chlorine (non-metal), forming the ionic compound NaCl.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "They are not both metals (A) or both non-metals (C). A is a metal and B is a non-metal, not the reverse (D). With Na having 1 valence electron and Cl needing 1 electron, they naturally form the ionic compound sodium chloride (NaCl)."
