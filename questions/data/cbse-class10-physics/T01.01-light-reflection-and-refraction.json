    "text": "Light is a form of energy that travels in straight lines. When light falls on a polished surface, it bounces back — this is called reflection. The laws of reflection state that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, and the incident ray, reflected ray, and normal all lie in the same plane. Spherical mirrors (concave and convex) form images of different sizes and nature depending on the position of the object. The mirror formula 1/v + 1/u = 1/f relates object distance, image distance, and focal length. Refraction is the bending of light when it passes from one medium to another due to a change in speed. Snell's law states n₁ sin i = n₂ sin r. Lenses (convex and concave) refract light to form images, governed by the lens formula 1/v - 1/u = 1/f. The power of a lens is the reciprocal of its focal length in metres, measured in dioptres.",

Substituting: 1/(-60) + 1/(-20) = 1/f, giving -1/60 - 1/30 = -1/60 - 3/60 = -4/60 = 1/f. Therefore f = -60/4 = -15 cm. The focal length is 15 cm (the negative sign indicates it is a concave mirror).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "With u = -20 cm and v = -60 cm (real image in front of the mirror), applying 1/f = 1/v + 1/u = 1/(-60) + 1/(-20) = -4/60, so f = -15 cm. Arjun finds the focal length is 15 cm. Options A, C, and D result from incorrect substitution or sign errors."

Meera sees an enlarged upright image of the toy.",

By Snell's law, n₁ sin 0° = n₂ sin r, which gives sin r = 0, so r = 0°. The light passes straight through without changing direction. This is the exception — refraction (change of speed) still occurs, but no bending takes place.",

The angle of incidence (measured between the incident ray and the normal) is therefore 0°. By the law of reflection, the angle of reflection must also be 0°. This means the reflected ray also travels along the normal but in the opposite direction, effectively retracing the path of the incident ray.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The light retraces its path not because the mirror is flat or because of absorption. It is because the law of reflection states that the angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence. When the incident ray is along the normal, both angles are 0°, so the reflected ray goes back along the same path."

      "explanation_correct": "The pencil appears bent due to refraction of light. Light rays from the submerged part of the pencil travel from water (denser medium) to air (rarer medium) and bend away from the normal at the water surface. This change in direction makes the submerged part appear to be at a slightly different position than where it actually is, creating the illusion of a bent pencil.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The pencil is not physically bent or swollen. The illusion occurs because light changes direction (refracts) when passing from water to air. The submerged portion appears raised and shifted, making the pencil look bent at the water surface. This is a classic example of refraction."

The diminished image covers a wider field of view, allowing the driver to see a larger area of the road behind. An erect image is essential so that the driver can correctly interpret the positions of vehicles and objects behind. Concave mirrors would give a narrow field of view and inverted images, making them unsuitable for this purpose.",
