    "text": "Light is a form of energy that travels in straight lines. When light falls on a polished surface, it bounces back — this is called reflection. The laws of reflection state that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, and the incident ray, reflected ray, and normal all lie in the same plane. Spherical mirrors (concave and convex) form images of different sizes and nature depending on the position of the object. The mirror formula 1/v + 1/u = 1/f relates object distance, image distance, and focal length. Refraction is the bending of light when it passes from one medium to another due to a change in speed. Snell's law states n₁ sin i = n₂ sin r. Lenses (convex and concave) refract light to form images, governed by the lens formula 1/v - 1/u = 1/f. The power of a lens is the reciprocal of its focal length in metres, measured in dioptres.",

      "explanation_correct": "The mirror formula is 1/v + 1/u = 1/f, where v is the image distance, u is the object distance, and f is the focal length. All three quantities are measured from the pole of the mirror using the sign convention.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'f' (focal length). The mirror formula relates the object distance (u), image distance (v), and focal length (f) of a spherical mirror as 1/v + 1/u = 1/f."
