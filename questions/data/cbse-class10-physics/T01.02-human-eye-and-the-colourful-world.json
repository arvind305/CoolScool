    "text": "The human eye is a natural optical instrument that uses a convex lens (the eye lens) to form a real, inverted, and diminished image on the retina. The ciliary muscles change the shape (and focal length) of the lens to focus on objects at different distances — this ability is called the power of accommodation. The near point of a normal eye is 25 cm, and the far point is at infinity. Defects of vision include myopia (corrected by concave lens), hypermetropia (corrected by convex lens), and presbyopia (corrected by bifocal lens). When white light passes through a glass prism, it splits into seven colours (VIBGYOR) — this is dispersion. Atmospheric refraction causes twinkling of stars and early sunrise/delayed sunset. Scattering of light by small particles explains why the sky is blue (Tyndall effect) and why the sun appears reddish at sunrise and sunset.",

      "explanation_correct": "The blue colour of the sky is due to the scattering of sunlight by the tiny particles in the Earth's atmosphere. Blue light, having a shorter wavelength, is scattered much more than red light, making the sky appear blue.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'scattering'. The blue sky is a result of the scattering (specifically Rayleigh scattering) of shorter wavelengths of sunlight by atmospheric molecules."

      "explanation_correct": "The cornea is the transparent, curved front surface of the eye through which light first enters. It provides most of the eye's optical power by refracting the incoming light. After the cornea, light passes through the pupil and the eye lens before reaching the retina.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The iris is the coloured disc that controls pupil size. The lens is behind the iris. The retina is at the back. The cornea is the outermost transparent layer where light first enters the eye."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Dispersion occurs because different colours of light travel at different speeds in a transparent medium like glass. Since each colour has a different wavelength, it has a different refractive index in glass. Violet light slows down the most and red the least, so they are refracted by different amounts.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Dispersion does not occur because all colours travel at the same speed (they travel at different speeds in glass), or because colours are absorbed or reflected. It is the difference in speeds (and hence refractive indices) of different colours that causes them to separate."

      "explanation_incorrect": "In hypermetropia, the image of nearby objects forms behind the retina, not in front of it. This is the opposite of myopia, where the image forms in front of the retina. A convex lens provides additional converging power to correct this."
