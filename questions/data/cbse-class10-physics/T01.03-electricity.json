    "text": "Electric current is the rate of flow of electric charge through a conductor. The SI unit of current is ampere (A). Potential difference is the work done per unit charge in moving a charge between two points, measured in volts (V). Ohm's law states that the potential difference across a conductor is directly proportional to the current flowing through it, provided the temperature remains constant (V = IR). The resistance of a conductor depends on its length, cross-sectional area, material (resistivity), and temperature. Resistors can be combined in series (R = R₁ + R₂ + ...) or parallel (1/R = 1/R₁ + 1/R₂ + ...). The heating effect of electric current is given by Joule's law: H = I²Rt. Electric power P = VI = I²R = V²/R, and electrical energy is measured in kWh (1 kWh = 3.6 × 10⁶ J).",
