    "text": "A current-carrying conductor produces a magnetic field around it. The direction of the magnetic field due to a straight conductor is given by the right-hand thumb rule. A solenoid carrying current behaves like a bar magnet. An electromagnet is a temporary magnet made by winding a coil around a soft iron core. A current-carrying conductor placed in a magnetic field experiences a force, the direction of which is given by Fleming's left-hand rule — this is the principle behind an electric motor. When a conductor moves in a magnetic field (or a magnetic field changes near a conductor), an electric current is induced — this is electromagnetic induction, discovered by Faraday. The direction of induced current is given by Fleming's right-hand rule. Electric generators work on electromagnetic induction. Domestic circuits use live (red/brown), neutral (black/blue), and earth (green) wires, with safety devices like fuses and MCBs.",

      "explanation_correct": "An electric bell uses an electromagnet. When current flows, the electromagnet attracts the iron strip connected to the hammer, which strikes the bell. The circuit is then broken, the electromagnet loses magnetism, the strip returns, and the cycle repeats rapidly.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "An electric bell uses an electromagnet, not a permanent magnet, generator, or galvanometer. The electromagnet can be repeatedly magnetised and demagnetised, which makes the hammer strike the bell repeatedly."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The fuse is indeed connected in the live wire (in series). If it were in the neutral wire, the appliance would remain at live potential even after the fuse melts, which would be dangerous."

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation_correct": "Keeping the magnet stationary inside the coil does not change the magnetic flux, so no current is induced. The induced current can be increased by: moving the magnet faster (faster change in flux), using a stronger magnet (more flux), or increasing the number of turns (more EMF per unit change in flux).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "When the magnet is stationary, there is no change in magnetic flux through the coil, so no current is induced. All other options increase the rate of change of magnetic flux, thereby increasing the induced current."
