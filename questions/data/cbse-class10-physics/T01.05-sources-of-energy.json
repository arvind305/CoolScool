    "text": "Energy sources are classified as conventional (fossil fuels, hydroelectric, biomass) and non-conventional (solar, wind, tidal, geothermal, nuclear). Fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, natural gas) are non-renewable and cause pollution. Thermal power plants burn fossil fuels to generate electricity. Hydropower plants convert the potential energy of water stored at height into electrical energy. Solar energy can be harnessed using solar cells, solar panels, and solar cookers. Wind energy is used through windmills. Biomass and biogas are produced from organic waste. Nuclear energy is released through nuclear fission (splitting heavy nuclei) and nuclear fusion (combining light nuclei). Fission is used in nuclear reactors, while fusion occurs in the sun. A good source of energy should be economical, easily accessible, easy to store and transport, and environment-friendly.",
