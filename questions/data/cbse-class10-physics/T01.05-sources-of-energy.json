    "text": "Energy sources are classified as conventional (fossil fuels, hydroelectric, biomass) and non-conventional (solar, wind, tidal, geothermal, nuclear). Fossil fuels (coal, petroleum, natural gas) are non-renewable and cause pollution. Thermal power plants burn fossil fuels to generate electricity. Hydropower plants convert the potential energy of water stored at height into electrical energy. Solar energy can be harnessed using solar cells, solar panels, and solar cookers. Wind energy is used through windmills. Biomass and biogas are produced from organic waste. Nuclear energy is released through nuclear fission (splitting heavy nuclei) and nuclear fusion (combining light nuclei). Fission is used in nuclear reactors, while fusion occurs in the sun. A good source of energy should be economical, easily accessible, easy to store and transport, and environment-friendly.",

Nuclear fusion involves the combining of two light nuclei (such as hydrogen isotopes) to form a heavier nucleus (such as helium), also releasing energy. This is the fundamental difference between the two reactions.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Fission and fusion are opposite processes in terms of the nuclei involved. Fission splits heavy nuclei (like uranium), while fusion combines light nuclei (like hydrogen). They are not the same process."

      "explanation_correct": "Nuclear energy is classified as a non-conventional source and, notably, the fission reaction itself does not release greenhouse gases like CO₂. Students often assume that all power plants emit CO₂. While nuclear plants have concerns about radioactive waste and safety, they do not contribute to greenhouse gas emissions during the energy generation process.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Nuclear energy does not release CO₂ during fission — this surprises students who assume all power plants pollute the air. It is non-conventional and non-renewable (uranium is finite). Only fission (not fusion) occurs in current nuclear power plants. Uranium is not infinitely abundant, so it is not renewable."

        }
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Wind energy requires a minimum wind speed of about 15 km/h for effective electricity generation. Wind speed varies significantly across India — coastal areas like Tamil Nadu and Gujarat have strong winds, but many inland regions do not have consistent or adequate wind speeds. This geographical limitation makes wind energy impractical in those areas.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Wind energy is not limited by legal bans, pollution, or low output. The actual reason is that wind speed is not sufficient or consistent in all regions. Wind farms need sustained high wind speeds, which are only available in certain geographical locations like coastal areas and open plains."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Thermal power plants are located near coal mines because transporting large quantities of coal over long distances is expensive, energy-intensive, and logistically difficult. It is far more economical and efficient to generate electricity at the mine site and transmit it via high-voltage power lines to distant cities with minimal transmission losses.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The primary reason is economic efficiency — coal is heavy and costly to transport, while electricity can be transmitted efficiently over wires. The location is not about smoke being less harmful elsewhere, water availability, or altitude requirements."

      "explanation_correct": "Nuclear fusion requires extremely high temperatures (millions of degrees Celsius) and enormous pressures to force positively charged nuclei close enough to fuse. No material container can withstand such temperatures. Scientists are working on magnetic confinement methods, but controlled, sustained fusion for power generation has not yet been achieved, making it commercially unviable.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The reason fusion is not used in power plants is the inability to achieve and sustain the extreme temperatures and pressures required. Fusion actually produces less radioactive waste than fission. Hydrogen (fusion fuel) is abundant on Earth. Fusion releases far more energy than chemical reactions — the challenge is purely technological."
