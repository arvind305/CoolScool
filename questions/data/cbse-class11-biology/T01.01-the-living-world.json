    "text": "The living world is remarkably diverse, encompassing millions of species across all habitats on Earth. Biodiversity refers to the variety and variability of life forms at genetic, species, and ecosystem levels. The study of diversity requires systematic classification, which is the domain of taxonomy. Taxonomy involves identification, nomenclature, and classification of organisms based on shared characteristics. The need for taxonomy arises from the enormous diversity of life and the necessity for a universal system to organize and communicate about organisms. Carolus Linnaeus is considered the father of taxonomy and introduced the binomial system of nomenclature, giving each organism a two-part scientific name consisting of the genus and species epithet, written in Latin or Latinised form. The genus name is capitalised while the species epithet is in lowercase, and both are italicised in print or underlined when handwritten. The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN) governs the naming of plants, while the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) governs animal names. Taxonomic categories form a hierarchy: Species, Genus, Family, Order, Class, Phylum (or Division for plants), and Kingdom. A species is a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring under natural conditions. Higher categories become progressively more inclusive, with Kingdom being the broadest. Taxonomic aids help in identification and classification. A herbarium is a collection of dried, pressed, and preserved plant specimens mounted on sheets. Botanical gardens maintain living collections of plants for study. Museums house preserved specimens of plants and animals. Taxonomic keys, particularly dichotomous keys, use contrasting characters (couplets) to identify organisms step by step. Monographs and manuals provide comprehensive information about taxa within specific regions or groups.",
