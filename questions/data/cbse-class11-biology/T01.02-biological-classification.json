    "text": "Biological classification is the process of grouping organisms based on shared characteristics. R.H. Whittaker (1969) proposed the five-kingdom classification system based on cell structure, body organisation, mode of nutrition, reproduction, and phylogenetic relationships. The five kingdoms are Monera (prokaryotes), Protista (unicellular eukaryotes), Fungi (heterotrophic eukaryotes with cell walls of chitin), Plantae (multicellular autotrophs), and Animalia (multicellular heterotrophs without cell walls). Kingdom Monera includes all prokaryotic organisms and is divided into Archaebacteria and Eubacteria. Archaebacteria are ancient bacteria that live in extreme environments such as hot springs (thermoacidophiles), salt lakes (halophiles), and marshy areas (methanogens). Eubacteria include most common bacteria, which may be autotrophic (photosynthetic like cyanobacteria, or chemosynthetic) or heterotrophic. Bacteria have four shapes: coccus (spherical), bacillus (rod), vibrio (comma), and spirillum (spiral). They reproduce mainly by binary fission and sometimes show genetic recombination. Kingdom Protista includes unicellular eukaryotes such as Chrysophytes (diatoms and golden algae), Dinoflagellates, Euglenoids, Slime moulds, and Protozoans. Kingdom Fungi are heterotrophic organisms that obtain nutrition by absorption. They include Phycomycetes (e.g., Mucor, Rhizopus), Ascomycetes (sac fungi, e.g., Aspergillus, yeast), Basidiomycetes (club fungi, e.g., mushrooms, puffballs), and Deuteromycetes (imperfect fungi). Viruses are non-cellular infectious agents with either DNA or RNA enclosed in a protein coat (capsid). They are obligate intracellular parasites that reproduce only inside host cells. Viroids are smaller than viruses, consisting of free RNA without a protein coat, and cause plant diseases. Prions are infectious protein particles that cause neurological diseases like mad cow disease. Lichens are symbiotic associations between algae (phycobiont) and fungi (mycobiont).",
