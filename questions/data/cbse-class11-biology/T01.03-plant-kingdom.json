    "text": "The plant kingdom encompasses a wide range of organisms from simple algae to complex flowering plants. Algae are chlorophyll-bearing, largely aquatic, simple, thalloid organisms classified into three classes: Chlorophyceae (green algae with chlorophyll a and b, starch storage, e.g., Chlamydomonas, Spirogyra, Ulva), Phaeophyceae (brown algae with chlorophyll a, c, and fucoxanthin, laminarin and mannitol storage, e.g., Ectocarpus, Fucus, Sargassum), and Rhodophyceae (red algae with chlorophyll a, d, and phycoerythrin, floridean starch storage, e.g., Polysiphonia, Porphyra, Gracilaria). Bryophytes are the simplest land plants, called 'amphibians of the plant kingdom' because they require water for fertilisation. They include liverworts (Marchantia) and mosses (Funaria). The dominant phase is the gametophyte, and the sporophyte is dependent on it. Pteridophytes are the first vascular land plants with true xylem and phloem. They include Selaginella, Equisetum, and ferns (Dryopteris). The dominant phase is the sporophyte, while the gametophyte (prothallus) is small and independent. Gymnosperms are seed-bearing plants without enclosed seeds. The ovules are exposed on megasporophylls. Examples include Pinus, Cycas, and Ginkgo. Angiosperms are flowering plants with seeds enclosed in fruits. They are divided into monocotyledons and dicotyledons. Plant life cycles show alternation of generations between a haploid gametophyte (produces gametes by mitosis) and a diploid sporophyte (produces spores by meiosis). In bryophytes, the gametophyte dominates; in pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms, the sporophyte dominates. The progressive reduction of the gametophyte and increasing dominance of the sporophyte is a key evolutionary trend.",
    "rules": [
      "Chlorophyceae (green algae): chlorophyll a and b, starch storage, cellulose cell wall; examples: Chlamydomonas, Spirogyra, Ulva.",

      "Heterospory (production of two types of spores: microspores and megaspores) is seen in some pteridophytes, all gymnosperms, and all angiosperms."
