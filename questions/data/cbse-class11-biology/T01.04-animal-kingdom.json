    "text": "The animal kingdom encompasses an enormous diversity of organisms classified on the basis of body organisation, symmetry, coelom type, segmentation, and the presence or absence of a notochord. Animals are broadly divided into non-chordates (Porifera through Hemichordata) and chordates, which possess a notochord at some stage of life. Non-chordates include phyla such as Porifera (sponges), Cnidaria (coelenterates), Platyhelminthes (flatworms), Aschelminthes (roundworms), Annelida (segmented worms), Arthropoda (the largest phylum), Mollusca, Echinodermata, and Hemichordata.\n\nPhylum Chordata is characterised by the presence of a notochord, a dorsal hollow nerve cord, and paired pharyngeal gill slits. Chordates are subdivided into Urochordata, Cephalochordata, and Vertebrata. Vertebrates are further classified into classes Cyclostomata (jawless fish), Chondrichthyes (cartilaginous fish), Osteichthyes (bony fish), Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves, and Mammalia, each distinguished by specific features such as type of skeleton, respiratory organs, heart chambers, body covering, and mode of reproduction.",
    "rules": [
      "Levels of organisation: cellular (Porifera), tissue (Cnidaria), organ (Platyhelminthes), organ-system (Annelida onward).",
      "Symmetry: asymmetrical (most sponges), radial (Cnidaria, Echinodermata adults), bilateral (most other phyla).",
      "Germ layers: diploblastic (Cnidaria) vs triploblastic (Platyhelminthes onward).",
      "Coelom types: acoelomate (Platyhelminthes), pseudocoelomate (Aschelminthes), coelomate (Annelida onward).",
      "Non-chordates lack a notochord; chordates possess it at least during embryonic development.",
      "Arthropoda is the largest animal phylum; insects form the majority.",
      "Echinoderms are exclusively marine and show radial symmetry in adults but bilateral symmetry in larvae.",
      "Chondrichthyes have a cartilaginous endoskeleton; Osteichthyes have a bony endoskeleton.",
      "Amphibians are the first tetrapods to colonise land but depend on water for reproduction.",
      "Reptiles are the first truly terrestrial vertebrates with internal fertilisation and shelled eggs.",
      "Aves are warm-blooded with feathers, pneumatic bones, and a four-chambered heart.",
      "Mammals are viviparous (except monotremes), possess mammary glands, hair, and a diaphragm."
