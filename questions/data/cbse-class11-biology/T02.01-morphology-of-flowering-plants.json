  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Morphology deals with the study of external form and structure of plants. Angiosperms (flowering plants) have a well-organised body consisting of roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds. Roots may be tap roots (dicots) or adventitious/fibrous roots (monocots), and can be modified for storage (fusiform, napiform, conical), support (prop roots, stilt roots), or respiration (pneumatophores). Stems can be modified into tubers, bulbs, rhizomes, corms, runners, stolons, tendrils, thorns, and phylloclades. Leaves vary in shape, venation (reticulate in dicots, parallel in monocots), phyllotaxy (alternate, opposite, whorled), and can be simple or compound (pinnately or palmately compound).\n\nFlowers are the reproductive organs, with parts arranged in whorls: calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium. Inflorescence types include racemose and cymose. Aestivation (arrangement of petals in a bud) can be valvate, twisted, imbricate, or vexillary. Placentation types include marginal, axile, parietal, basal, and free central. Fruits develop from the ovary and are classified as simple, aggregate, or composite. Seeds are either monocotyledonous or dicotyledonous. The families Fabaceae, Solanaceae, and Liliaceae are described in detail with their floral formulae and diagrams.",
    "rules": [
      "Tap root system is characteristic of dicots; fibrous root system of monocots.",
      "Stem modifications include tuber (potato), bulb (onion), rhizome (ginger), corm (colocasia), runner (grass), stolon (jasmine).",
      "Reticulate venation is typical of dicots; parallel venation of monocots.",
      "Phyllotaxy types: alternate (sunflower), opposite (Calotropis), whorled (Alstonia).",
      "Compound leaves are pinnate (neem) or palmate (silk cotton); simple leaves have undivided lamina.",
      "Racemose inflorescence has acropetal succession; cymose has basipetal succession.",
      "Aestivation: valvate (Calotropis), twisted (China rose), imbricate (Cassia), vexillary/papilionaceous (pea).",
      "Placentation types: marginal (pea), axile (China rose), parietal (mustard), basal (sunflower), free central (Dianthus).",
      "Fabaceae: papilionaceous corolla, diadelphous stamens, marginal placentation.",
      "Solanaceae: tubular calyx, funnel-shaped corolla, epipetalous stamens, axile placentation.",
      "Liliaceae: perianth of 6 tepals, 6 stamens, axile placentation, mostly bulbous plants."
