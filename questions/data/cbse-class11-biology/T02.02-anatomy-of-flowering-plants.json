    "text": "Anatomy deals with the internal structure of plants. Plant tissues are broadly classified into meristematic tissues (actively dividing) and permanent tissues (differentiated). Meristematic tissues are apical (root and shoot tips), lateral (cambium), and intercalary (at internodes). Permanent tissues include simple tissues — parenchyma (thin-walled, living, with intercellular spaces), collenchyma (thickened at corners, living), and sclerenchyma (thick-walled, dead, lignified) — and complex tissues — xylem (tracheids, vessels, xylem fibres, xylem parenchyma) and phloem (sieve tubes, companion cells, phloem fibres, phloem parenchyma).\n\nThe tissue system includes the epidermal tissue system (epidermis, stomata, trichomes), ground tissue system (cortex, pith, medullary rays), and vascular tissue system (xylem and phloem arranged in vascular bundles). Dicot and monocot roots, stems, and leaves differ in their internal anatomy. Dicot stems have open vascular bundles (with cambium) arranged in a ring, while monocot stems have closed bundles (without cambium) scattered throughout. Secondary growth occurs in dicots due to the activity of vascular cambium and cork cambium, producing secondary xylem (wood) and secondary phloem, as well as periderm. Heartwood and sapwood differ in function; annual rings reflect seasonal growth.",
    "rules": [
      "Meristematic tissues: apical (primary growth), lateral/intercalary; cells are thin-walled, dense cytoplasm, no vacuoles.",
      "Parenchyma — thin-walled, living, intercellular spaces; collenchyma — corner thickening, living; sclerenchyma — uniformly thick, dead, lignified.",
      "Xylem conducts water and minerals; tracheids and vessels are conducting elements; vessels are present only in angiosperms.",
      "Phloem transports food; sieve tubes and companion cells are the main elements; companion cells are absent in gymnosperms.",
      "Casparian strip in the endodermis of roots controls water and mineral passage into the vascular cylinder.",
      "Open vascular bundles (with cambium) in dicot stems allow secondary growth; closed bundles (without cambium) in monocot stems do not.",
      "Dicot root has limited secondary growth; pith is small or absent; xylem is 2-6 arched.",
      "Monocot root has polyarch xylem, large pith, and no secondary growth.",
      "Secondary growth: vascular cambium produces secondary xylem (inward) and secondary phloem (outward).",
      "Cork cambium (phellogen) produces cork (phellem) outward and secondary cortex (phelloderm) inward — together called periderm.",
      "Heartwood is dark, non-functional, and filled with tannins/resins; sapwood is light and conducts water.",
      "Annual rings are formed due to differential activity of cambium in spring (spring wood) and autumn (autumn wood)."
