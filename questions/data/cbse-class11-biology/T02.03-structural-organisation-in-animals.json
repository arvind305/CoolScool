    "text": "Structural organisation in animals involves the study of animal tissues, and the detailed morphology and anatomy of selected organisms. Animal tissues are classified into four types: epithelial (covering and lining tissues), connective (support and binding), muscular (movement), and neural (impulse conduction). Epithelial tissues include squamous, cuboidal, columnar, ciliated, and glandular types. Connective tissues include loose (areolar, adipose), dense (tendons, ligaments), specialised (cartilage, bone, blood), and fluid connective tissues.\n\nThree organisms are studied in detail: Earthworm (Pheretima posthuma) — a coelomate, metameric annelid with closed circulation, nephridia for excretion, and a typhlosole for increased absorption; Cockroach (Periplaneta americana) — an arthropod with open circulation, Malpighian tubules for excretion, and tracheal system for respiration; and Frog (Rana tigrina) — an amphibian with a three-chambered heart, cutaneous and pulmonary respiration, and adaptations for both aquatic and terrestrial life.",
    "rules": [
      "Epithelial tissue: cells tightly packed, little intercellular matrix, rests on a basement membrane.",
      "Squamous epithelium lines blood vessels (endothelium) and lung alveoli; cuboidal lines kidney tubules; columnar lines intestine.",
      "Connective tissue has abundant extracellular matrix (fibres + ground substance) with relatively fewer cells.",
      "Areolar tissue is the most widely distributed connective tissue; blood is a fluid connective tissue.",
      "Striated (skeletal) muscle is voluntary; smooth (visceral) muscle is involuntary; cardiac muscle is involuntary and shows intercalated discs.",
      "Neurons have a cell body (cyton), dendrites (receive impulses), and an axon (transmits impulses).",
      "Earthworm has closed circulation, nephridia (excretory), typhlosole (increases gut absorption area), and setae for locomotion.",
      "Cockroach has open circulatory system, Malpighian tubules for excretion, tracheal system for respiration, and mosaic vision.",
      "Cockroach blood (haemolymph) does not carry oxygen; respiration is through spiracles and tracheae.",
      "Frog has a three-chambered heart (two atria, one ventricle), performs cutaneous respiration in water and pulmonary respiration on land.",
      "Frog undergoes metamorphosis: aquatic tadpole (gill respiration) transforms into terrestrial adult (lung + skin respiration).",
      "Frog is poikilothermic (cold-blooded) and undergoes hibernation (winter) and aestivation (summer)."

      "explanation_correct": "Cutaneous respiration in frogs requires a thin film of moisture on the skin surface. Oxygen from the air first dissolves in this moisture layer and then diffuses through the thin skin into the dermal blood capillaries. Without moisture, gas exchange across the skin cannot occur.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "While moist skin may aid thermoregulation, the primary reason it must remain moist is for cutaneous respiration. Gases dissolve in the surface moisture before diffusing across the skin into blood — this is the mechanism of cutaneous gas exchange."

A single ventricle allows partial mixing, but the spiral valve in the conus arteriosus helps direct blood appropriately. Complete separation (four chambers) is not necessary because cutaneous respiration supplements pulmonary respiration, and the frog's lower metabolic rate (poikilothermic) tolerates some mixing.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Heart size is not related to body size in this context. Evolutionary timing alone does not explain functional anatomy. Frogs absolutely need oxygenated blood.
