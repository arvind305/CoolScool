    "text": "The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of all living organisms. Cell theory, proposed by Schleiden and Schwann and later modified by Rudolf Virchow, states that all living organisms are composed of cells and products of cells, and that all cells arise from pre-existing cells. Cells are broadly classified into prokaryotic and eukaryotic types. Prokaryotic cells (e.g., bacteria, cyanobacteria) lack a well-defined nucleus; their genetic material lies in a nucleoid region and is not bound by a nuclear membrane. They possess 70S ribosomes, a cell wall (usually of peptidoglycan), and may contain plasmids, mesosomes, and flagella. Eukaryotic cells (found in protists, fungi, plants, and animals) have a well-organised nucleus with a nuclear envelope, membrane-bound organelles, and 80S ribosomes.\nThe plasma membrane follows the fluid mosaic model proposed by Singer and Nicolson (1972), in which a lipid bilayer of phospholipids with embedded integral and peripheral proteins provides selective permeability. Transport across the membrane occurs via passive means (diffusion, osmosis, facilitated diffusion) and active transport requiring ATP. Eukaryotic cells contain an elaborate endomembrane system comprising the endoplasmic reticulum (rough and smooth), Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and vacuoles. Mitochondria are double-membrane-bound organelles with cristae and matrix, possessing their own circular DNA and 70S ribosomes; they are the sites of aerobic respiration. Chloroplasts, found in plant cells, have thylakoids organised into grana and a stroma, and also contain their own DNA and ribosomes. The cytoskeleton is composed of microtubules, microfilaments, and intermediate filaments, providing structural support, motility, and intracellular transport. Cilia and flagella display a characteristic 9+2 arrangement of microtubules. Centrioles have a 9+0 arrangement (nine triplets, no central pair) and are involved in cell division.",
