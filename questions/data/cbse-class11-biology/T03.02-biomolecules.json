    "text": "Biomolecules are the organic molecules that form the structural and functional basis of living organisms. They include carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, and enzymes. Carbohydrates are polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones classified as monosaccharides (e.g., glucose, fructose, ribose), disaccharides (e.g., sucrose, maltose, lactose), oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides (e.g., starch, glycogen, cellulose, chitin). Reducing sugars (e.g., glucose, maltose) have a free anomeric carbon and can reduce Fehling's or Benedict's solution. Lipids are heterogeneous compounds including fats, oils, phospholipids, and steroids; fats are esters of glycerol with fatty acids. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, linked by peptide bonds formed through condensation reactions. There are 20 standard amino acids, each having an amino group, a carboxyl group, a hydrogen atom, and a variable R group attached to a central alpha-carbon.\nProteins exhibit four levels of structural organisation: primary (linear sequence of amino acids), secondary (alpha-helix or beta-pleated sheet due to hydrogen bonding), tertiary (three-dimensional folding stabilised by various bonds), and quaternary (assembly of multiple polypeptide subunits, e.g., haemoglobin). Nucleic acids — DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid) — are polymers of nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of a nitrogenous base (purine or pyrimidine), a pentose sugar, and a phosphate group. DNA has deoxyribose sugar and bases A, T, G, C; RNA has ribose sugar and bases A, U, G, C. Enzymes are biological catalysts, mostly proteins, that accelerate biochemical reactions without being consumed. They are classified into six major classes: oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, and ligases. Enzyme activity is explained by the lock-and-key model and the induced fit model. Factors affecting enzyme activity include temperature, pH, substrate concentration, and the presence of inhibitors (competitive and non-competitive). Cofactors (metal ions), coenzymes (organic molecules like NAD⁺, FAD), and prosthetic groups are non-protein components essential for enzyme function.",
