  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "The cell cycle is the sequence of events by which a cell duplicates its genome, synthesises other cellular components, and eventually divides into two daughter cells. The cell cycle consists of two main phases: interphase and the M phase (mitotic phase). Interphase is the period between two successive cell divisions and includes three sub-phases: G₁ phase (gap 1, cell growth and preparation for DNA synthesis), S phase (synthesis phase, DNA replication occurs and the chromosome number is effectively doubled in terms of DNA content), and G₂ phase (gap 2, preparation for mitosis with synthesis of proteins and organelle duplication). Cells that do not divide further exit the cell cycle and enter a quiescent stage called G₀ phase. The M phase includes mitosis (nuclear division) and cytokinesis (cytoplasmic division).\nMitosis is an equational division that produces two genetically identical daughter cells, each with the same chromosome number as the parent cell. It occurs in somatic cells and is essential for growth, repair, and asexual reproduction. Mitosis has four stages: prophase (chromatin condenses into chromosomes, nuclear envelope begins to break down, spindle fibres form), metaphase (chromosomes align at the metaphase plate, spindle fibres attach to kinetochores at centromeres), anaphase (centromeres split, sister chromatids are pulled apart to opposite poles), and telophase (chromosomes decondense, nuclear envelopes reform, nucleoli reappear). Cytokinesis in animal cells occurs by cleavage furrow formation, while in plant cells it occurs by cell plate formation from the centre outward.\nMeiosis is a reductional division that produces four genetically different haploid cells from a single diploid cell. It consists of two successive divisions: meiosis I (reductional) and meiosis II (equational). Prophase I is the longest and most complex phase, subdivided into five stages: leptotene (chromosomes become visible as thin threads), zygotene (homologous chromosomes pair up — synapsis — forming bivalents), pachytene (crossing over occurs at chiasmata between non-sister chromatids of homologous chromosomes), diplotene (homologues begin to separate except at chiasmata, recombination visible), and diakinesis (chiasmata terminalize, nuclear envelope breaks down). Meiosis is essential for sexual reproduction, maintaining chromosome number across generations, and generating genetic diversity through crossing over and independent assortment.",
