  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants convert light energy into chemical energy, synthesising organic compounds from carbon dioxide and water. It occurs in chloroplasts, which contain thylakoids organised into grana and stroma lamellae. The light reactions take place in the thylakoid membranes and involve two photosystems: PS I (P700) and PS II (P680). During non-cyclic electron transport, water is split (photolysis) at PS II, electrons pass through carriers to PS I and ultimately reduce NADP+ to NADPH. ATP is generated by chemiosmotic phosphorylation as protons flow through ATP synthase. The Calvin cycle (C3 pathway) occurs in the stroma: CO2 is fixed by RuBisCO onto RuBP to form 3-PGA, which is reduced to G3P using ATP and NADPH, and RuBP is regenerated. C4 plants like maize use PEP carboxylase in mesophyll cells to fix CO2 into OAA, which is shuttled as malate to bundle-sheath cells where the Calvin cycle operates, thereby concentrating CO2 and minimising photorespiration. CAM plants fix CO2 at night. Photorespiration is a wasteful process in C3 plants where RuBisCO fixes O2 instead of CO2. Factors affecting photosynthesis include light intensity, CO2 concentration, and temperature, governed by Blackman's law of limiting factors.",

      "CAM plants open stomata at night to fix CO₂ via PEP carboxylase; Calvin cycle runs during the day.",

The reason is true — CO₂ is indeed the substrate fixed by RuBisCO in the Calvin cycle.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The assertion claims CO₂ 'always' increases the rate, which is false due to Blackman's law of limiting factors. After saturation, further CO₂ increase has no effect. The reason (CO₂ is a Calvin cycle substrate) is true. Therefore, assertion is false and reason is true."

CO₂ fixation may continue briefly, producing more 3-PGA. Therefore, 3-PGA accumulates while G3P is depleted as it is used up in regeneration without being replenished.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "G3P would be depleted, not accumulated, because it cannot be formed from 3-PGA without ATP and NADPH. CO₂ fixation would slow and stop as RuBP runs out. The Calvin cycle depends entirely on ATP and NADPH from light reactions, so it is immediately affected."
