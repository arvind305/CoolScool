    "text": "Cellular respiration is the process by which organisms break down organic molecules to release energy in the form of ATP. It comprises glycolysis, the TCA cycle (Krebs cycle), and the electron transport chain (ETC). Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm and converts one molecule of glucose (6C) into two molecules of pyruvic acid (3C), yielding a net gain of 2 ATP and 2 NADH. Under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate undergoes fermentation — alcoholic fermentation (in yeast, producing ethanol and CO₂) or lactic acid fermentation (in muscles). Under aerobic conditions, pyruvate enters the mitochondria, is oxidatively decarboxylated to acetyl CoA (by pyruvate dehydrogenase), and enters the TCA cycle in the mitochondrial matrix. Each acetyl CoA turn of the TCA cycle produces 3 NADH, 1 FADH₂, 1 GTP, and 2 CO₂. The ETC on the inner mitochondrial membrane transfers electrons from NADH and FADH₂ to O₂ (the terminal electron acceptor), creating a proton gradient that drives ATP synthase. The theoretical maximum yield is 36 ATP per glucose (or 38 in some calculations). The respiratory quotient (RQ) is the ratio of CO₂ evolved to O₂ consumed and varies with the substrate. Respiration is amphibolic — it is both catabolic (breaking down substrates) and anabolic (providing intermediates for biosynthesis).",

      "explanation_incorrect": "RQ values of less than 1, equal to 1, or greater than 1 all assume some O₂ is consumed. In anaerobic respiration, O₂ consumption is zero, making the denominator zero and the RQ undefined (infinite). This is a key distinction between aerobic and anaerobic respiration."

These demonstrate how TCA cycle intermediates serve as biosynthetic precursors.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Complete oxidation of acetyl CoA is purely catabolic. Production of NADH/FADH₂ for the ETC is a catabolic function. ATP production by substrate-level phosphorylation is also catabolic. Only the withdrawal of intermediates for biosynthesis demonstrates the anabolic (and thus amphibolic) nature."
