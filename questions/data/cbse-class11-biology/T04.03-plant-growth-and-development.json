    "text": "Plant growth is unique because plants retain the capacity for unlimited growth due to meristematic tissues. Growth is measurable in terms of increase in cell number, cell size, or fresh/dry weight. Growth occurs in three phases: cell division (formative phase), cell enlargement (elongation phase), and cell differentiation (maturation phase). Growth can be arithmetic (constant rate, linear) or geometric (exponential, doubling). Growth rate can be absolute (total growth per unit time) or relative (growth per unit time per unit initial size). Plant growth regulators (PGRs) are small organic molecules that influence growth and development. The five major classes are auxins (promote cell elongation, apical dominance, root initiation), gibberellins (stem elongation, seed germination, bolting), cytokinins (promote cell division, delay senescence), ethylene (fruit ripening, abscission, senescence), and abscisic acid (ABA — stress hormone, stomatal closure, seed dormancy). Photoperiodism is the response of plants to the relative length of day and night; plants are classified as short-day, long-day, or day-neutral. Vernalisation is the promotion of flowering by exposure to low temperatures. Seed dormancy prevents germination under unfavourable conditions and can be broken by various factors including light, temperature, and hormones.",

These tissues contain actively dividing cells, allowing continuous formation of new organs and indefinite growth, unlike most animals whose growth is determinate.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Plants can grow across multiple seasons. Growth does not stop after flowering — vegetative growth may continue. Plants grow in both light and dark conditions. The key feature is the retention of meristematic tissues that allow unlimited growth potential."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Stratification (cold stratification) involves placing seeds in layers between moist sand or peat at low temperatures (1-5°C) for several weeks to months. This cold-moist treatment mimics natural winter conditions and is necessary for many temperate species to break dormancy and allow germination in spring.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Acid treatment to soften the seed coat is scarification, not stratification. Gibberellin treatment is a chemical method of breaking dormancy. High temperatures would not simulate winter conditions. Stratification specifically involves cold-moist treatment to break physiological dormancy."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Auxin, gibberellin, and cytokinin are all growth promoters that stimulate various aspects of growth and development. ABA and ethylene are generally classified as growth inhibitors. ABA specifically antagonises the growth-promoting effects of gibberellins and auxins."
