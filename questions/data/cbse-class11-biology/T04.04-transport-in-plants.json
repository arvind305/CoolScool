  "topic_name": "Transport in Plants",
  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Transport in plants involves the movement of water, minerals, and organic solutes across cells and over long distances. Water moves through cells by diffusion and osmosis. Diffusion is the passive movement of molecules from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration. Osmosis is the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential. Water potential (Ψw) is defined as Ψw = Ψs + Ψp, where Ψs is the solute potential (always negative) and Ψp is the pressure potential. Pure water at atmospheric pressure has a water potential of zero. Plasmolysis occurs when a plant cell is placed in a hypertonic solution — water leaves the cell by exosmosis, and the protoplast shrinks away from the cell wall. Imbibition is the absorption of water by hydrophilic colloids (e.g., dry seeds absorbing water).\nWater absorption by roots occurs mainly through root hairs by osmosis. Water moves from root hairs to the xylem through two pathways: the apoplast pathway (through cell walls and intercellular spaces, blocked at the endodermis by the Casparian strip) and the symplast pathway (through cytoplasm of cells connected by plasmodesmata). Root pressure is positive hydrostatic pressure developed in the xylem of roots, which can push water upward and is responsible for guttation (exudation of water droplets from hydathodes). The main mechanism for ascent of sap in tall trees is the transpiration pull or cohesion-tension theory proposed by Dixon and Joly, which relies on transpiration creating a tension (negative pressure) that pulls water upward through continuous water columns held together by cohesion (water-water hydrogen bonds) and adhesion (water-xylem wall attraction).\nTranspiration is the loss of water as vapour from aerial parts of the plant, primarily through stomata (stomatal transpiration, ~90%), but also through cuticle (cuticular transpiration) and lenticels (lenticular transpiration). Stomatal opening and closing is regulated by guard cells through changes in turgor: K⁺ ion uptake lowers the water potential in guard cells, water enters by osmosis, guard cells swell and the stoma opens. Factors affecting transpiration include light, temperature, humidity, wind velocity, and the number and distribution of stomata. Translocation of organic solutes (mainly sucrose) occurs through the phloem, explained by the pressure flow or mass flow hypothesis proposed by Ernst Munch. Sucrose is loaded at the source (e.g., leaves), increasing osmotic pressure; water enters the phloem by osmosis, creating a pressure that drives the sap towards the sink (e.g., roots, fruits, storage organs), where sucrose is unloaded.",

      "explanation_correct": "At the sink (e.g., roots, fruits, growing tips), sucrose is actively or passively unloaded from the sieve tubes into the surrounding cells. This reduces the solute concentration in the sieve tubes, causing water to move out (back to the xylem) by osmosis, reducing turgor pressure.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Sucrose loading occurs at the source, not the sink. Photosynthesis occurs in leaves (source). Root pressure is a separate phenomenon. At the sink, sucrose is unloaded and water returns to the xylem."
