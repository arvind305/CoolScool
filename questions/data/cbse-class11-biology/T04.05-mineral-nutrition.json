    "text": "Mineral nutrition deals with the study of essential mineral elements required by plants for their normal growth and development. Plants obtain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen from CO2 and water, while other elements are absorbed as mineral ions from the soil solution. Hydroponics, the technique of growing plants in a defined nutrient solution without soil, has been instrumental in identifying these essential elements.\n\nArnon and Stout (1939) proposed criteria for essentiality: the element must be absolutely necessary for normal growth, its requirement must be specific and not replaceable, and it must be directly involved in plant metabolism. Based on the quantity required, essential elements are classified as macronutrients (needed in large amounts, e.g., N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S) and micronutrients (needed in trace amounts, e.g., Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, B, Mo, Cl, Ni). Deficiency of any essential element leads to characteristic symptoms such as chlorosis, necrosis, stunted growth or inhibition of cell division. Toxicity occurs when any mineral ion concentration exceeds the optimal level. Nitrogen metabolism is of special significance as nitrogen is a major constituent of proteins, nucleic acids and other biomolecules. The nitrogen cycle involves processes like nitrogen fixation (biological and industrial), ammonification, nitrification and denitrification. Biological nitrogen fixation is carried out by free-living organisms (Azotobacter, Clostridium) and symbiotic bacteria (Rhizobium in root nodules of legumes). The enzyme nitrogenase catalyses the reduction of atmospheric N2 to NH3, and leg-haemoglobin maintains the anaerobic conditions required for nitrogenase activity.",
    "rules": [
      "An essential element must satisfy all three criteria of Arnon and Stout: absolutely necessary, specific and irreplaceable, and directly involved in metabolism.",
      "Macronutrients (C, H, O, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S) are required in concentrations of 1 to 10 mg per gram of dry matter or more.",
      "Micronutrients (Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, B, Mo, Cl, Ni) are required in concentrations of less than 0.1 mg per gram of dry matter.",
      "Nitrogen is a constituent of proteins, nucleic acids, chlorophyll and vitamins; phosphorus is a component of nucleic acids, ATP and cell membranes.",
      "Chlorosis (loss of chlorophyll leading to yellowing of leaves) is caused by deficiency of N, K, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Zn or Mo.",
      "Necrosis (death of tissue) occurs due to deficiency of Ca, Mg, Cu or K.",
      "Hydroponics allows precise study of mineral requirements by growing plants in defined nutrient solutions.",
      "Biological nitrogen fixation is catalysed by the enzyme nitrogenase, which requires anaerobic conditions provided by leg-haemoglobin in root nodules.",
      "The nitrogen cycle includes nitrogen fixation, ammonification, nitrification (by Nitrosomonas and Nitrobacter) and denitrification (by Pseudomonas).",
      "Rhizobium forms symbiotic association with roots of leguminous plants, forming root nodules for nitrogen fixation.",
      "Toxicity of any mineral element inhibits uptake of other elements and may cause deficiency symptoms of the latter.",
      "Molybdenum is a component of nitrogenase and is essential for nitrogen fixation; zinc activates the enzyme carboxylase."
