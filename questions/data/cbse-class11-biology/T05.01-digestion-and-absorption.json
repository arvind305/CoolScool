    "text": "The human digestive system consists of the alimentary canal and associated digestive glands. The alimentary canal begins at the mouth (buccal cavity) and extends through the pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum), large intestine (caecum, colon, rectum) and ends at the anus. The wall of the alimentary canal has four layers: serosa (outermost), muscularis (smooth muscle), submucosa (connective tissue with blood vessels and nerves) and mucosa (innermost, with epithelial lining). The major digestive glands are salivary glands, liver and pancreas, along with numerous small glands in the gastric and intestinal mucosa.\n\nDigestion involves mechanical and chemical breakdown of food. Salivary amylase initiates starch digestion in the mouth. In the stomach, pepsinogen is activated to pepsin by HCl, which digests proteins. The pancreas secretes trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, lipase, amylase and nucleases. Bile from the liver emulsifies fats. Intestinal juice (succus entericus) contains enzymes like maltase, sucrase, lactase, peptidases, lipase and nucleotidases that complete digestion. Absorption occurs mainly in the small intestine through villi and microvilli, which greatly increase the surface area. Amino acids, monosaccharides and fatty acids are absorbed by active transport, facilitated diffusion and passive transport. Disorders of the digestive system include protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) such as kwashiorkor and marasmus, indigestion, constipation, vomiting, jaundice and diarrhoea.",

      "The dental formula of adult humans is 2123/2123, giving a total of 32 teeth (8 incisors, 4 canines, 8 premolars, 12 molars).",
      "Salivary amylase (ptyalin) converts starch into maltose in the slightly alkaline pH of the mouth.",
      "HCl in gastric juice activates pepsinogen to pepsin and provides an acidic pH (1.8) optimal for pepsin activity.",
      "Bile salts emulsify fats into smaller micelles, increasing the surface area for lipase action.",
      "Pancreatic juice contains trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, procarboxypeptidase, pancreatic lipase, amylase and nucleases.",
      "Trypsinogen is activated by enterokinase (enteropeptidase) secreted by the intestinal mucosa.",
      "Villi and microvilli of the small intestine greatly increase the absorptive surface area.",
      "Absorption of digested nutrients occurs by active transport, facilitated diffusion and passive diffusion; fats are absorbed as micelles and re-esterified in intestinal cells.",
      "Kwashiorkor results from protein deficiency in children, while marasmus results from simultaneous deficiency of proteins and calories.",
      "The large intestine absorbs water, minerals and certain vitamins; bacteria in the colon synthesise vitamins B and K.",
