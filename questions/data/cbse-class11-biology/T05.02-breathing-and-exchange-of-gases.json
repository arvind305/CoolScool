  "topic_name": "Breathing and Exchange of Gases",
  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Breathing (ventilation) is the mechanical process of moving air in and out of the lungs, while respiration encompasses the entire process of gas exchange and cellular utilisation of oxygen. The human respiratory system consists of the external nostrils, nasal cavities, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli. The lungs are situated in the thoracic cavity and are enclosed by a double-layered pleural membrane. Each lung contains approximately 300 million alveoli, providing a large surface area (~100 m2) for gas exchange.\n\nBreathing involves two phases: inspiration (inhalation) and expiration (exhalation), regulated by the contraction and relaxation of the diaphragm and external/internal intercostal muscles. Pulmonary volumes include tidal volume (TV, ~500 mL), inspiratory reserve volume (IRV, ~2500-3000 mL), expiratory reserve volume (ERV, ~1000-1100 mL) and residual volume (RV, ~1100-1200 mL). Vital capacity = TV + IRV + ERV (~3400-4800 mL). Gas exchange at the alveolar surface occurs by simple diffusion, driven by partial pressure differences. Oxygen is transported in blood as oxyhaemoglobin (~97%) and dissolved in plasma (~3%). The oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve is sigmoid-shaped, and factors like high pCO2, low pH, high temperature and high 2,3-DPG shift the curve to the right (Bohr effect), facilitating O2 release in tissues. CO2 is transported as dissolved CO2 (~7%), as bicarbonate ions (~70%, via chloride shift) and as carbaminohaemoglobin (~23%). Respiration is regulated by the respiratory centre in the medulla oblongata, with input from chemoreceptors sensitive to CO2 and H+ ion concentrations. Common respiratory disorders include asthma, emphysema, occupational lung diseases and lung cancer.",
    "rules": [
      "Inspiration is an active process involving contraction of the diaphragm (flattens) and external intercostal muscles (lift the ribs), increasing thoracic volume and decreasing intrapulmonary pressure.",
      "Expiration is normally a passive process involving relaxation of the diaphragm and external intercostal muscles, decreasing thoracic volume and increasing intrapulmonary pressure.",
      "Tidal volume (TV) is ~500 mL; inspiratory reserve volume (IRV) is ~2500-3000 mL; expiratory reserve volume (ERV) is ~1000-1100 mL; residual volume (RV) is ~1100-1200 mL.",
      "Vital capacity (VC) = TV + IRV + ERV; total lung capacity (TLC) = VC + RV.",
      "Gas exchange at the alveolar surface occurs by simple diffusion along partial pressure gradients: O2 moves from alveoli (pO2 ~104 mmHg) to blood, and CO2 moves from blood (pCO2 ~45 mmHg) to alveoli.",
      "Each haemoglobin molecule can bind four O2 molecules; the O2-Hb dissociation curve is sigmoid (S-shaped).",
      "The Bohr effect: high pCO2, low pH and high temperature shift the O2-Hb dissociation curve to the right, promoting O2 release in active tissues.",
      "CO2 is transported as: dissolved in plasma (~7%), bicarbonate ions in plasma (~70%, formed by carbonic anhydrase in RBCs), and carbaminohaemoglobin (~23%).",
      "The chloride shift (Hamburger's phenomenon) maintains electrical neutrality when HCO3- ions move out of RBCs into plasma and Cl- ions move in.",
      "The respiratory centre in the medulla oblongata controls the rate and depth of breathing; pneumotaxic centre in the pons moderates the respiratory centre.",
      "Chemoreceptors in the aortic arch and carotid body detect changes in CO2, O2 and H+ levels in blood and signal the respiratory centre.",
      "Asthma involves bronchospasm and difficulty in breathing; emphysema involves alveolar wall damage and reduced gas exchange surface area."
