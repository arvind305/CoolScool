    "text": "Body fluids include blood, lymph (tissue fluid) and interstitial fluid, which together constitute the internal transport system of the body. Blood is a connective tissue consisting of plasma (55%) and formed elements (45%) — red blood corpuscles (RBCs/erythrocytes), white blood corpuscles (WBCs/leucocytes) and platelets (thrombocytes). Plasma contains water (90-92%), proteins (albumins, globulins, fibrinogen), glucose, amino acids, lipids, hormones, electrolytes and dissolved gases. RBCs are biconcave, enucleated discs containing haemoglobin. WBCs are of two types: granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils) and agranulocytes (lymphocytes, monocytes). Blood groups (ABO and Rh) are determined by surface antigens on RBCs. Blood coagulation involves a cascade of reactions converting fibrinogen to fibrin threads that seal the wound.\n\nThe human heart is a four-chambered organ (two atria and two ventricles) enclosed in a pericardial sac. The SA node (sino-atrial node), located in the right atrium, acts as the natural pacemaker. The cardiac cycle lasts about 0.8 seconds and includes atrial systole, ventricular systole and joint diastole. Cardiac output = stroke volume x heart rate (~70 mL x 72 beats/min = ~5040 mL/min). The electrocardiogram (ECG) records the electrical activity of the heart: P wave (atrial depolarisation), QRS complex (ventricular depolarisation) and T wave (ventricular repolarisation). Humans have a double circulation system — pulmonary (heart-lungs-heart) and systemic (heart-body-heart). The lymphatic system returns interstitial fluid to the blood. Common cardiovascular disorders include hypertension, coronary artery disease, angina pectoris and heart failure.",
    "rules": [
      "Blood plasma constitutes about 55% of blood volume and contains water (90-92%), proteins (albumin, globulin, fibrinogen), glucose, amino acids and electrolytes.",
      "RBCs are biconcave, enucleated (in mammals) discs with a lifespan of about 120 days; they are formed in the red bone marrow and destroyed in the spleen.",
      "ABO blood grouping is based on the presence of antigens A and B on RBC surface: Type A (antigen A), Type B (antigen B), Type AB (both antigens, universal recipient), Type O (no antigens, universal donor).",
      "Rh factor: Rh-positive individuals have Rh antigen on their RBCs; erythroblastosis foetalis occurs when an Rh-negative mother carries an Rh-positive foetus in subsequent pregnancies.",
      "The coagulation cascade involves conversion of prothrombin to thrombin (by thromboplastin and Ca2+), and thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin, which forms the clot.",
      "The SA node (pacemaker) is located in the right atrium and generates impulses that initiate each heartbeat at ~72 beats per minute.",
      "The conduction system of the heart: SA node → AV node → Bundle of His → Purkinje fibres.",
      "The cardiac cycle (0.8 s) consists of atrial systole (0.1 s), ventricular systole (0.3 s) and joint diastole (0.4 s).",
      "ECG waves: P wave = atrial depolarisation, QRS complex = ventricular depolarisation, T wave = ventricular repolarisation.",
      "Cardiac output = Stroke volume × Heart rate; normal cardiac output is approximately 5 litres per minute.",
      "Double circulation: Pulmonary circuit (right ventricle → lungs → left atrium) carries deoxygenated blood to lungs; systemic circuit (left ventricle → body → right atrium) distributes oxygenated blood.",
      "Hypertension is defined as persistently high blood pressure (above 140/90 mmHg); atherosclerosis is the deposition of fatty plaques on arterial walls."

The liver processes, detoxifies and stores nutrients before the blood enters the general circulation.",
