    "text": "Excretion is the process of removal of metabolic waste products, especially nitrogenous wastes, from the body. Animals are classified based on the major nitrogenous waste they excrete: ammonotelic organisms (ammonia), ureotelic organisms (urea), and uricotelic organisms (uric acid). The human excretory system consists of a pair of kidneys, a pair of ureters, a urinary bladder, and a urethra. Each kidney contains about one million nephrons, the structural and functional units. A nephron comprises the Bowman's capsule (containing the glomerulus), proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule (DCT), and collecting duct. Cortical nephrons constitute about 85% and have short loops of Henle, while juxtamedullary nephrons have long loops extending deep into the medulla.\n\nUrine formation involves three processes: glomerular filtration, tubular reabsorption, and tubular secretion. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is approximately 125 mL/min or 180 litres per day. The PCT reabsorbs most of the filtrate including glucose, amino acids, Na⁺, and water. The loop of Henle maintains the medullary osmotic gradient through a counter-current mechanism, aided by the vasa recta. The DCT and collecting ducts are regulated by hormones: ADH (antidiuretic hormone) increases water reabsorption, aldosterone increases Na⁺ reabsorption, and ANF (atrial natriuretic factor) promotes natriuresis. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system activates when blood pressure or blood volume falls. Disorders include uraemia, renal calculi (kidney stones), glomerulonephritis, and renal failure. Haemodialysis serves as an artificial kidney for patients with renal failure, and kidney transplantation provides a permanent solution.",
    "rules": [
      "Ammonotelic organisms excrete ammonia (aquatic animals like bony fishes); ureotelic excrete urea (mammals); uricotelic excrete uric acid (birds, reptiles, insects).",
      "Each human kidney contains about one million nephrons; cortical nephrons (~85%) have short loops, juxtamedullary nephrons (~15%) have long loops extending into medulla.",
      "A nephron consists of Bowman's capsule (with glomerulus), PCT, loop of Henle (descending and ascending limbs), DCT, and collecting duct.",
      "GFR is approximately 125 mL/min; about 180 litres of filtrate is formed per day, of which 99% is reabsorbed.",
      "PCT reabsorbs glucose, amino acids, Na⁺, and water; it also secretes H⁺ and ammonia to maintain acid-base balance.",
      "The counter-current mechanism between the loop of Henle and vasa recta maintains the medullary concentration gradient essential for urine concentration.",
      "The descending limb of loop of Henle is permeable to water but impermeable to electrolytes; the ascending limb is impermeable to water but transports electrolytes.",
      "ADH (vasopressin) from the posterior pituitary increases water reabsorption in DCT and collecting ducts; its deficiency causes diabetes insipidus.",
      "Aldosterone from the adrenal cortex promotes Na⁺ and water reabsorption in DCT; ANF from the heart causes natriuresis (sodium excretion).",
      "The renin-angiotensin mechanism: JGA cells release renin when GFR falls → angiotensinogen → angiotensin II → vasoconstriction + aldosterone release → GFR restored.",
      "Haemodialysis uses a cellulose membrane to filter blood against a dialysing fluid; it removes urea and other wastes while retaining plasma proteins.",
      "Kidney stones (reite calculi) are formed by crystallisation of calcium oxalate or calcium phosphate within the kidney."
