    "text": "Movement is one of the characteristic features of living organisms. It may be of different types: amoeboid, ciliary, flagellar, and muscular. Locomotion is the voluntary movement of an organism from one place to another. In humans, the locomotory system comprises the muscular system and the skeletal system. There are three types of muscles: skeletal (striated, voluntary), smooth (non-striated, involuntary), and cardiac (striated, involuntary). Skeletal muscles are attached to bones and are responsible for body movements. Each muscle fibre is a syncytium containing multiple nuclei. The myofibrils within each fibre show alternating dark (A band or anisotropic) and light (I band or isotropic) bands. The functional unit of contraction is the sarcomere, bounded by two Z lines, containing the central A band with the H zone and M line.\n\nMuscle contraction follows the sliding filament theory: a nerve impulse at the neuromuscular junction releases acetylcholine, which triggers an action potential in the muscle fibre. Ca²⁺ is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, binds to troponin on actin filaments, causing tropomyosin to shift and expose active sites. Myosin heads bind to actin, forming cross-bridges, and pull the actin filaments towards the centre of the sarcomere using energy from ATP hydrolysis. This causes the I band and H zone to shorten while the A band remains unchanged. The human skeleton consists of 206 bones, divided into the axial skeleton (skull, vertebral column, ribs, sternum — 80 bones) and the appendicular skeleton (limb bones and girdles — 126 bones). Joints are classified as fibrous (immovable), cartilaginous (slightly movable), and synovial (freely movable). Disorders include myasthenia gravis, muscular dystrophy, tetany, osteoporosis, arthritis, and gout.",
