    "text": "The neural system coordinates and integrates the functions of different organs and organ systems through electrical impulses. The human neural system is divided into the central nervous system (CNS — brain and spinal cord) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS — cranial and spinal nerves). The PNS is further divided into the somatic nervous system (voluntary) and the autonomic nervous system (involuntary), which includes the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. The neuron is the structural and functional unit of the nervous system. It consists of a cell body (soma), dendrites, and an axon. Neurons are classified as sensory (afferent), motor (efferent), and interneurons (association neurons). Myelinated nerve fibres have a myelin sheath with gaps called nodes of Ranvier, enabling saltatory conduction.\n\nA nerve impulse is an electrochemical signal. The resting membrane potential (~-70 mV) is maintained by the Na⁺/K⁺ pump. When stimulated, Na⁺ channels open (depolarisation), creating an action potential that propagates along the axon. Repolarisation occurs when K⁺ channels open. At the synapse, neurotransmitters (e.g., acetylcholine) are released from synaptic vesicles to transmit the signal to the next neuron. The brain has three major parts: the forebrain (cerebrum, thalamus, hypothalamus), the midbrain, and the hindbrain (cerebellum, pons, medulla oblongata). The cerebrum is the largest part, responsible for higher mental functions. The cerebellum coordinates voluntary movements and maintains balance. The medulla controls involuntary functions like breathing and heart rate. The brain is protected by the cranium, meninges (three membranes), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). A reflex arc is the neural pathway for a reflex action, involving a receptor, sensory neuron, integration centre (spinal cord), motor neuron, and effector. The eye and ear are important sense organs. The eye has photoreceptors (rods for dim light, cones for colour vision) on the retina. The ear is responsible for hearing (cochlea, organ of Corti) and balance (semicircular canals, vestibular apparatus).",

This occurs when the eyeball is too short or the lens is insufficiently convex. A convex (converging) lens brings the focal point forward onto the retina.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Myopia involves difficulty seeing distant objects (image forms in front of retina), which is the opposite of Riya's symptoms. Astigmatism causes blurred vision at all distances due to uneven corneal curvature.

This is the mechanism by which organophosphate pesticides and nerve agents cause toxicity.",
