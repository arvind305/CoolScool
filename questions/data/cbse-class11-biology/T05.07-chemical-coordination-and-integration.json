    "text": "The endocrine system works alongside the nervous system to coordinate and integrate body functions. Endocrine glands are ductless glands that secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream. The major endocrine glands include the hypothalamus, pituitary, pineal, thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal, pancreas, thymus, and gonads. The hypothalamus produces releasing and inhibiting hormones that regulate the anterior pituitary. The pituitary gland has two lobes: the anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis) secretes GH, PRL, TSH, ACTH, LH, and FSH; the posterior pituitary (neurohypophysis) stores and releases ADH and oxytocin (produced by the hypothalamus). The thyroid gland secretes T₃ (triiodothyronine), T₄ (thyroxine), and calcitonin. The parathyroid glands secrete PTH (parathyroid hormone). The adrenal gland has two parts: the cortex (secretes cortisol, aldosterone, and sex steroids) and the medulla (secretes adrenaline and noradrenaline).\n\nThe pancreas is both an exocrine and endocrine gland. The islets of Langerhans contain alpha cells (secrete glucagon) and beta cells (secrete insulin). Insulin lowers blood glucose, while glucagon raises it. The gonads (testes and ovaries) secrete sex hormones: testosterone (testes), oestrogen and progesterone (ovaries). The thymus secretes thymosin, important for T-cell differentiation. Hormones act through two mechanisms: peptide hormones bind to membrane receptors and use second messengers like cAMP, while steroid hormones enter the cell and bind to intracellular receptors to regulate gene expression. Hormone secretion is regulated by feedback mechanisms, primarily negative feedback. Common disorders include dwarfism, gigantism, and acromegaly (GH imbalance), goitre and cretinism (thyroid dysfunction), diabetes mellitus (insulin deficiency or resistance), and Addison's disease (adrenal cortex hypofunction).",
    "rules": [
      "The hypothalamus produces releasing hormones (e.g., GnRH, TRH, CRH) and inhibiting hormones that control the anterior pituitary.",
      "Anterior pituitary secretes: GH (growth), PRL (prolactin, milk production), TSH (thyroid-stimulating), ACTH (adrenocorticotrophic), LH and FSH (gonadotrophins).",
      "Posterior pituitary stores and releases: ADH (water reabsorption in kidneys) and oxytocin (uterine contractions, milk ejection) — both produced in the hypothalamus.",
      "Thyroid hormones (T₃ and T₄) regulate BMR, growth, and development; calcitonin lowers blood Ca²⁺ by promoting calcium deposition in bones.",
      "PTH raises blood Ca²⁺ by stimulating bone resorption, increased renal reabsorption, and intestinal absorption (via vitamin D activation).",
      "Adrenal cortex: glucocorticoids (cortisol — stress, anti-inflammatory), mineralocorticoids (aldosterone — Na⁺/K⁺ balance), and sex corticoids.",
      "Adrenal medulla: adrenaline and noradrenaline (catecholamines) — fight-or-flight response; increase heart rate, blood pressure, and blood glucose.",
      "Pancreatic islets: insulin (beta cells) lowers blood glucose (promotes glycogenesis, lipogenesis); glucagon (alpha cells) raises blood glucose (promotes glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis).",
      "Peptide hormones act via membrane receptors and second messengers (cAMP); steroid hormones enter the cell and bind to intracellular/nuclear receptors to regulate gene expression.",
      "Negative feedback: high hormone levels inhibit further release of stimulating hormones; e.g., high T₃/T₄ inhibits TSH and TRH release.",
      "GH disorders: excess in childhood = gigantism, excess in adults = acromegaly, deficiency in childhood = pituitary dwarfism.",
      "Thyroid disorders: iodine deficiency = simple goitre; hypothyroidism in infancy = cretinism; in adults = myxoedema; hyperthyroidism = Graves' disease (exophthalmic goitre)."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Diabetes insipidus involves excessive dilute urine but not high blood sugar. Addison's disease causes low blood pressure and fatigue. Cushing's syndrome causes central obesity and moon face. The combination of high blood sugar, polyuria, and polydipsia is characteristic of diabetes mellitus."
