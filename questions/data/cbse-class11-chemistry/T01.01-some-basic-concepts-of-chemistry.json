    "text": "Chemistry is the branch of science that studies the composition, structure, properties, and transformations of matter. Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space, and it exists in three principal states: solid, liquid, and gas. The laws of chemical combination govern how elements combine. The Law of Conservation of Mass (Lavoisier) states that matter can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. The Law of Definite Proportions (Proust) states that a given compound always contains the same elements in the same proportion by mass. The Law of Multiple Proportions (Dalton) states that when two elements combine to form more than one compound, the masses of one element that combine with a fixed mass of the other are in simple whole-number ratios. Dalton's atomic theory proposed that atoms are indivisible particles of elements and that compounds form when atoms of different elements combine in fixed ratios. The atomic mass unit (u) is defined as 1/12th the mass of a carbon-12 atom. Molecular mass is the sum of atomic masses of all atoms in a molecule. The mole is the amount of substance that contains as many entities as there are atoms in exactly 12 g of carbon-12; this number is Avogadro's number, Nₐ = 6.022 × 10²³. Molar mass is the mass of one mole of a substance in grams. Percentage composition gives the mass percent of each element in a compound. The empirical formula shows the simplest whole-number ratio of atoms, while the molecular formula shows the actual number of atoms. Stoichiometry deals with the quantitative relationships between reactants and products in a balanced chemical equation. The limiting reagent is the reactant that is completely consumed first and determines the maximum amount of product formed. Reactions in solutions use molarity (M = moles of solute / volume of solution in litres) as the concentration unit.",
