    "text": "The atom, once thought to be indivisible, is composed of three fundamental subatomic particles: electrons (discovered by J.J. Thomson via cathode ray experiments, charge −1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C, mass 9.109 × 10⁻³¹ kg), protons (discovered by Goldstein via anode rays, charge +1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C, mass 1.673 × 10⁻²⁷ kg), and neutrons (discovered by Chadwick, no charge, mass 1.675 × 10⁻²⁷ kg). Thomson's plum pudding model proposed electrons embedded in a uniform sphere of positive charge. Rutherford's alpha-particle scattering experiment showed that the atom has a tiny, dense, positively charged nucleus with electrons revolving around it. However, Rutherford's model could not explain the stability of the atom or the line spectra of elements. Bohr's model introduced quantised orbits: electrons revolve in fixed circular orbits of definite energy (stationary states) around the nucleus. Energy is absorbed or emitted only when an electron transitions between orbits: ΔE = E₂ − E₁ = hν. The angular momentum of an electron is quantised: mvr = nh/2π. Bohr's model successfully explained hydrogen's line spectrum but failed for multi-electron atoms. The quantum mechanical model, developed by Schrödinger, treats the electron as a wave described by a wave function ψ. De Broglie proposed wave-particle duality: λ = h/mv. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle states that it is impossible to simultaneously determine the exact position and momentum of an electron: Δx · Δp ≥ h/4π. The Schrödinger wave equation gives solutions called orbitals, each characterised by quantum numbers. The principal quantum number (n) determines the energy level and size of the orbital. The azimuthal quantum number (l) determines the shape (l = 0 is s, l = 1 is p, l = 2 is d, l = 3 is f). The magnetic quantum number (mₗ) determines the orientation of the orbital. The spin quantum number (mₛ) specifies the spin direction (+½ or −½). Electronic configuration follows three rules: the Aufbau principle (fill orbitals in order of increasing energy, following the (n+l) rule), the Pauli exclusion principle (no two electrons can have all four quantum numbers identical; maximum 2 electrons per orbital with opposite spins), and Hund's rule of maximum multiplicity (electrons occupy degenerate orbitals singly with parallel spins before pairing).",
