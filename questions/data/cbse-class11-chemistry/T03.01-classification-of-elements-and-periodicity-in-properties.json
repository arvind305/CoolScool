    "text": "The classification of elements has evolved over centuries. Dobereiner's triads grouped elements into sets of three where the atomic weight of the middle element was approximately the average of the other two (e.g., Li-Na-K, Ca-Sr-Ba). Newlands' law of octaves arranged elements by increasing atomic weight and noted that every eighth element had similar properties — this worked only up to calcium. Mendeleev's periodic table arranged elements by increasing atomic mass and grouped them by similar chemical properties, leaving gaps for undiscovered elements (eka-boron, eka-aluminium, eka-silicon). The modern periodic law (Moseley, 1913) states that the physical and chemical properties of elements are a periodic function of their atomic numbers. The modern periodic table has 18 groups and 7 periods. Groups 1-2 are s-block, groups 13-18 are p-block, groups 3-12 are d-block, and the lanthanides and actinides form the f-block. Elements are classified as metals, non-metals, and metalloids (semi-metals). Atomic radius generally decreases across a period (increasing nuclear charge with same principal shell) and increases down a group (addition of new shells). Ionic radius: cations are smaller than parent atoms, anions are larger. Ionisation enthalpy (IE) is the energy required to remove the most loosely bound electron from an isolated gaseous atom. IE generally increases across a period and decreases down a group. Electron gain enthalpy (EGE) is the enthalpy change when an electron is added to an isolated gaseous atom. Halogens have the most negative EGE (most exothermic); noble gases have positive EGE. Electronegativity (Pauling scale) increases across a period and decreases down a group; fluorine is the most electronegative element. Metallic character decreases across a period and increases down a group. Anomalous properties arise in the second period due to small size, high electronegativity, absence of d orbitals, and the ability to form pπ-pπ multiple bonds (e.g., N₂ has a triple bond, O₂ has a double bond, while P and S form single bonds in their allotropes).",
