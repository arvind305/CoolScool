    "text": "Atoms combine to form molecules by chemical bonding in order to attain a stable noble gas configuration. The three main types of bonding are ionic (electrovalent), covalent, and coordinate (dative) bonding. Ionic bonding involves the transfer of electrons from a metal to a non-metal, forming cations and anions held together by electrostatic forces. Lattice enthalpy is the energy required to completely separate one mole of an ionic compound into its gaseous ions; higher lattice enthalpy indicates a more stable ionic compound. The Born-Haber cycle relates lattice enthalpy to other thermodynamic quantities. Covalent bonding involves the sharing of electron pairs between atoms. Lewis dot structures show shared and lone electron pairs. The octet rule states that atoms tend to achieve 8 electrons in their valence shell, though there are exceptions (incomplete octet in BF₃, expanded octet in PCl₅ and SF₆, odd-electron molecules like NO). Formal charge = (valence electrons) − (non-bonding electrons) − ½(bonding electrons); the best Lewis structure minimises formal charges. Resonance occurs when more than one valid Lewis structure can be drawn for a molecule; the actual structure is a hybrid. Bond parameters include bond length (internuclear distance), bond angle (angle between bonded atoms), bond order (number of bonds between two atoms), and bond enthalpy (energy to break one mole of bonds). VSEPR theory (Sidgwick and Powell, refined by Gillespie and Nyholm) predicts molecular geometry by minimising repulsion between electron pairs around the central atom. Lone pair-lone pair repulsion > lone pair-bond pair repulsion > bond pair-bond pair repulsion. Common geometries: linear (2 electron pairs), trigonal planar (3), tetrahedral (4), trigonal bipyramidal (5), octahedral (6). Lone pairs cause deviation from ideal bond angles. Hybridisation is the intermixing of atomic orbitals to form equivalent hybrid orbitals: sp (linear, 180°), sp² (trigonal planar, 120°), sp³ (tetrahedral, 109.5°), sp³d (trigonal bipyramidal), sp³d² (octahedral). Molecular Orbital Theory (MOT) treats electrons as belonging to the molecule as a whole. Atomic orbitals combine to form bonding MOs (lower energy) and antibonding MOs (higher energy). Bond order = ½(electrons in bonding MOs − electrons in antibonding MOs). If bond order > 0, the molecule is stable. MOT explains the paramagnetism of O₂ (two unpaired electrons in π* orbitals). Hydrogen bonding is a special type of dipole-dipole interaction between a hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative atom (F, O, N) and a lone pair on another electronegative atom. It can be intermolecular (between different molecules, e.g., water) or intramolecular (within the same molecule, e.g., o-nitrophenol).",
