    "text": "Matter exists in three principal states — solid, liquid, and gas — whose properties are determined by the balance between intermolecular forces and thermal energy. Intermolecular forces include dispersion (London) forces, dipole–dipole interactions, and hydrogen bonds; their relative strengths govern melting points, boiling points, and other physical properties. Gases are described quantitatively by the gas laws: Boyle's law (P ∝ 1/V at constant T), Charles's law (V ∝ T at constant P), Gay-Lussac's law (P ∝ T at constant V), and Avogadro's law (V ∝ n at constant T, P). These combine into the ideal gas equation PV = nRT, where R = 8.314 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹. Dalton's law of partial pressures states that the total pressure of a gas mixture equals the sum of the partial pressures. The kinetic molecular theory assumes gas molecules are point masses in random motion with perfectly elastic collisions; average kinetic energy is proportional to absolute temperature (KE = 3/2 kT). The Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution describes the spread of molecular speeds. Real gases deviate from ideal behaviour at high pressures and low temperatures. The van der Waals equation (P + a/V²)(V − b) = RT (for 1 mol) corrects for intermolecular attractions (a) and finite molecular volume (b). The critical temperature is the temperature above which a gas cannot be liquefied by pressure alone. The liquefaction of gases is achieved by methods such as Linde's process (Joule–Thomson effect) and Claude's process. In the liquid state, vapour pressure is the pressure exerted by a vapour in equilibrium with its liquid at a given temperature; it increases with temperature and is independent of the amount of liquid. Surface tension is the force per unit length acting at the surface of a liquid, arising from the net inward pull on surface molecules. Viscosity is a measure of a liquid's resistance to flow, caused by intermolecular attractive forces; it decreases with increasing temperature.",

      "explanation_correct": "Vapour pressure increases with temperature. Since the vapour pressure of water reaches 1 atm at 100 °C (its normal boiling point), at the lower temperature of 80 °C the vapour pressure must be less than 1 atm (approximately 0.47 atm).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "It cannot be greater than 1 atm at a temperature below the boiling point. It equals 1 atm only at 100 °C. It is not zero because water has a measurable vapour pressure at 80 °C."
