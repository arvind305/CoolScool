    "text": "Thermodynamics deals with energy changes accompanying physical and chemical processes. A system is the part of the universe under study; the surroundings are everything else. Systems are classified as open (exchange of matter and energy), closed (exchange of energy only), or isolated (no exchange). State functions (P, V, T, U, H, S, G) depend only on the current state, not on how that state was reached; path functions (q, w) depend on the path taken. Important processes include isothermal (constant T), adiabatic (q = 0), isobaric (constant P), and isochoric (constant V). The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved: ΔU = q + w, where q is heat absorbed and w is work done on the system. For expansion work against constant pressure, w = −P_ext ΔV. For reversible isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, w = −nRT ln(V₂/V₁). Enthalpy H = U + PV; at constant pressure, ΔH = qₚ. For ideal gases, ΔH = ΔU + ΔnₘRT, where Δnₘ is the change in moles of gas. Standard enthalpy changes include formation (ΔfH°), combustion (ΔcH°), atomisation, ionisation, bond dissociation, lattice enthalpy, and hydration enthalpy. Hess's law states that the total enthalpy change for a reaction is the same regardless of the pathway, enabling calculation of unknown enthalpies from known ones. Entropy (S) is a measure of the disorder or randomness of a system; ΔS = q_rev / T. The second law states that in any spontaneous process, the total entropy of the universe increases: ΔS_universe > 0. Gibbs free energy G = H − TS combines enthalpy and entropy. At constant T, P: ΔG = ΔH − TΔS. A process is spontaneous when ΔG < 0, at equilibrium when ΔG = 0, and non-spontaneous when ΔG > 0. The relationship ΔG° = −RT ln K connects thermodynamics to equilibrium.",
