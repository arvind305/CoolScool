    "text": "Equilibrium is the state in which the rates of the forward and reverse processes become equal, and the macroscopic properties of the system remain constant with time. Physical equilibria (e.g., liquid–vapour, solid–liquid) and chemical equilibria are both dynamic — processes continue at the molecular level even though no net change is observed. The law of mass action states that the rate of a reaction is proportional to the product of the active masses (concentrations) of the reactants, each raised to the power of its stoichiometric coefficient. For a general reaction aA + bB ⇌ cC + dD, the equilibrium constant Kc = [C]^c[D]^d / [A]^a[B]^b. When expressed in terms of partial pressures, Kp = (pC)^c(pD)^d / (pA)^a(pB)^b, and the relation Kp = Kc(RT)^Δn holds, where Δn = (c + d) − (a + b) for gaseous species. Le Chatelier's principle states that if a system at equilibrium is disturbed, it shifts in the direction that tends to counteract the disturbance. Changes in concentration, pressure, and temperature all affect the equilibrium position. Ionic equilibrium involves the equilibrium established by weak electrolytes in aqueous solution. Arrhenius defined acids as H⁺ donors and bases as OH⁻ donors in water; Brønsted–Lowry defined acids as proton donors and bases as proton acceptors; Lewis defined acids as electron-pair acceptors and bases as electron-pair donors. The ionic product of water Kw = [H⁺][OH⁻] = 1.0 × 10⁻¹⁴ at 25 °C. pH = −log[H⁺]; for acids Ka = [H⁺][A⁻]/[HA], and for bases Kb = [BH⁺][OH⁻]/[B]. The relation Ka × Kb = Kw holds for a conjugate acid–base pair. Buffer solutions resist changes in pH upon addition of small amounts of acid or base. The Henderson–Hasselbalch equation is pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA]). Solubility equilibrium involves sparingly soluble salts; the solubility product Ksp = product of the ion concentrations raised to their stoichiometric powers. Precipitation occurs when the ionic product Q > Ksp; the common ion effect decreases the solubility of a sparingly soluble salt.",
