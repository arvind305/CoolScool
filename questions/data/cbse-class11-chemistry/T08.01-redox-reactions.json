    "text": "Redox reactions involve the simultaneous transfer of electrons between species: oxidation is the loss of electrons (increase in oxidation number) and reduction is the gain of electrons (decrease in oxidation number). In classical terms, oxidation was defined as the addition of oxygen or removal of hydrogen, while reduction was the removal of oxygen or addition of hydrogen. The modern electron-transfer concept provides a more general framework. The oxidation number (oxidation state) is a formal charge assigned to an atom using specific rules: elements in their free state have oxidation number 0; monoatomic ions have oxidation numbers equal to their charge; oxygen is usually −2 (except in peroxides −1, superoxides −1/2, and OF₂ where it is +2); hydrogen is usually +1 (except in metal hydrides where it is −1); fluorine is always −1; the sum of oxidation numbers in a molecule equals 0, and in an ion equals the ion charge. An oxidising agent (oxidant) accepts electrons and gets reduced; a reducing agent (reductant) donates electrons and gets oxidised. Redox reactions are classified into types: combination reactions (A + B → AB), decomposition reactions (AB → A + B), displacement reactions (A + BC → AC + B), and disproportionation reactions (where the same element is simultaneously oxidised and reduced). Balancing redox reactions can be done by the oxidation number method (balance changes in oxidation number, then balance atoms and charge) or the half-reaction (ion-electron) method (split into oxidation and reduction half-reactions, balance each separately for atoms, oxygen using H₂O, hydrogen using H⁺ in acidic medium or OH⁻ in basic medium, and electrons, then combine so electrons cancel).",
    "rules": [
      "Oxidation: loss of electrons, increase in oxidation number. Reduction: gain of electrons, decrease in oxidation number.",
      "Classical definitions: oxidation = addition of oxygen or removal of hydrogen; reduction = removal of oxygen or addition of hydrogen.",
      "Oxidation number of a free element is 0; of a monoatomic ion equals its charge.",
      "Oxygen is −2 (exceptions: peroxides −1, superoxides −1/2, OF₂ +2); hydrogen is +1 (exception: metal hydrides −1).",
      "Fluorine is always −1 in compounds; sum of oxidation numbers equals 0 (molecules) or ion charge (polyatomic ions).",
      "Oxidising agent is reduced (gains electrons); reducing agent is oxidised (loses electrons).",
      "Disproportionation: a single element in one oxidation state is simultaneously oxidised and reduced.",
      "Oxidation number method: equalise the total increase and decrease in oxidation numbers, then balance remaining atoms.",
      "Half-reaction method (acidic): balance atoms other than O and H, add H₂O for O, H⁺ for H, electrons for charge.",
      "Half-reaction method (basic): after balancing in acidic medium, add OH⁻ to both sides to neutralise H⁺, forming H₂O."
