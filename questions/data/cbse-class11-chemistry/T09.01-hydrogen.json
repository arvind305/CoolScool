  "topic_name": "Hydrogen",
  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Hydrogen is the lightest and most abundant element in the universe (atomic number 1, electronic configuration 1s¹). It occupies a unique position in the periodic table because it resembles both alkali metals (Group 1: one valence electron, forms H⁺ cation, electropositive) and halogens (Group 17: one electron short of noble gas configuration, forms H⁻ hydride ion, exists as diatomic molecule H₂). Hydrogen has three isotopes: protium (¹H, no neutrons, most abundant ~99.98%), deuterium (²H or D, one neutron, ~0.02%), and tritium (³H or T, two neutrons, radioactive with t₁/₂ ≈ 12.33 years). Dihydrogen (H₂) can be prepared by the action of dilute acids on metals (Zn + H₂SO₄ → ZnSO₄ + H₂↑), electrolysis of water, reaction of metals with water or alkali (2Na + 2H₂O → 2NaOH + H₂), Bosch process (CO + H₂O → CO₂ + H₂ using Fe₂O₃-Cr₂O₃ catalyst at 673 K), Lane process using steam over red-hot iron, and the steam-reforming process (CH₄ + H₂O → CO + 3H₂ using Ni catalyst at 1270 K). Dihydrogen is a colourless, odourless, highly combustible gas (burns in air: 2H₂ + O₂ → 2H₂O). It reacts with halogens, nitrogen (Haber process: N₂ + 3H₂ → 2NH₃), and metal oxides (used as a reducing agent). Hydrides are classified as ionic/saline (formed by s-block metals except Be and Mg, e.g., NaH, CaH₂ — crystalline, high m.p., conduct electricity when molten, react with water: NaH + H₂O → NaOH + H₂), covalent/molecular (formed by p-block elements, e.g., CH₄, NH₃, H₂O, HF — volatile, low m.p. and b.p., can be electron-rich like NH₃, electron-precise like CH₄, or electron-deficient like B₂H₆), and metallic/interstitial (formed by d-block and f-block metals, e.g., TiH₁.₇, PdH₀.₇ — non-stoichiometric, hydrogen occupies interstitial sites in the metal lattice, good conductors, used in hydrogenation catalysis). Water (H₂O) has a bent structure with bond angle 104.5° due to two lone pairs on oxygen. It has anomalously high boiling point (373 K) due to extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Water is amphoteric (acts as both acid and base). Hard water contains dissolved Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ salts: temporary hardness is due to bicarbonates Ca(HCO₃)₂/Mg(HCO₃)₂ (removed by boiling or Clark's method — adding Ca(OH)₂), permanent hardness is due to chlorides and sulphates (removed by washing soda Na₂CO₃, Calgon's method Na₆P₆O₁₈, ion exchange resins, or distillation). Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) is prepared by acidification of barium peroxide (BaO₂ + H₂SO₄ → BaSO₄ + H₂O₂), electrolysis of 50% H₂SO₄, and industrially by the anthraquinone auto-oxidation process. H₂O₂ has an open-book (non-planar) structure with a dihedral angle of 111.5° (gas phase). It acts as both an oxidising agent (stronger tendency: H₂O₂ + 2H⁺ + 2e⁻ → 2H₂O) and a reducing agent (H₂O₂ → O₂ + 2H⁺ + 2e⁻). Decomposition: 2H₂O₂ → 2H₂O + O₂ (catalysed by MnO₂, finely divided metals, light). It is used as a bleaching agent, disinfectant, rocket propellant (90% H₂O₂), in pollution control, and as a hair bleach. Its strength is expressed in terms of volume strength (e.g., 10-volume H₂O₂ liberates 10 volumes of O₂ per volume of H₂O₂ at STP).",

Each water molecule can form up to four hydrogen bonds (two as donor through H atoms, two as acceptor through lone pairs on O). This creates a strong three-dimensional hydrogen-bonded network requiring significantly more energy to break during boiling.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Water (M = 18) actually has a lower molecular mass than H₂S (M = 34), so molecular mass cannot explain the higher b.p. The O–H bond is polar covalent, not ionic. Van der Waals forces are weaker in water than H₂S (which is larger and more polarisable). Hydrogen bonding is the key factor."

At 4°C the optimum balance is reached. Hydrogen bonds still exist extensively in liquid water at 4°C.",

This decomposition is accelerated by light (photodecomposition), heat, dust particles, and rough surfaces (which act as heterogeneous catalysts). Dark-coloured bottles prevent light exposure, and wax lining provides a smooth surface to minimise catalytic decomposition. Small amounts of stabilisers like acetanilide or phosphoric acid are often added.",
