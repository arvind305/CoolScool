  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "The s-block elements comprise Group 1 (alkali metals: Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Fr) and Group 2 (alkaline earth metals: Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Ra). Their general electronic configuration is [noble gas] ns¹ (Group 1) and [noble gas] ns² (Group 2). Alkali metals have the largest atomic radii in their respective periods and the lowest ionisation enthalpies, making them the most electropositive and reactive metals. Down the group, atomic radius increases, ionisation enthalpy decreases, and reactivity increases. They are soft metals with low melting and boiling points (decrease down the group due to weakening metallic bonding), silvery-white, and excellent conductors of heat and electricity. They impart characteristic flame colours: Li (crimson red), Na (golden yellow), K (violet), Rb (red-violet), Cs (blue). Alkali metals react vigorously with water: 2M + 2H₂O → 2MOH + H₂ (reactivity increases from Li to Cs). They burn in excess oxygen: Li forms Li₂O (oxide), Na forms Na₂O₂ (peroxide), K/Rb/Cs form MO₂ (superoxide). They react with hydrogen to form ionic hydrides (MH), with halogens to form halides (MX), and dissolve in liquid ammonia to form blue conducting solutions containing solvated electrons (M + (x+y)NH₃ → M⁺(NH₃)ₓ + e⁻(NH₃)ᵧ). Sodium hydroxide (NaOH, caustic soda) is manufactured by Castner-Kellner process (mercury cathode cell electrolysis of brine) or diaphragm cell or membrane cell. Sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃, washing soda) is manufactured by the Solvay process: NaCl + NH₃ + CO₂ + H₂O → NaHCO₃ + NH₄Cl; 2NaHCO₃ →(heat) Na₂CO₃ + H₂O + CO₂. Na₂CO₃·10H₂O is washing soda (efflorescent). Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃, baking soda) decomposes on heating: 2NaHCO₃ → Na₂CO₃ + H₂O + CO₂ (used in fire extinguishers and baking). KOH (caustic potash) is used in soft soap, KCl is used as fertiliser, KNO₃ (saltpetre) is used in gunpowder. Alkaline earth metals have smaller atomic radii and higher ionisation enthalpies than corresponding alkali metals. They are harder, denser, and have higher melting points. Flame colours: Ca (brick red), Sr (crimson), Ba (apple green); Be and Mg do not impart flame colour because their ionisation enthalpies are too high. Be shows anomalous behaviour due to very small size, high charge density, and absence of d-orbitals: it forms covalent compounds (BeCl₂ is linear and polymeric), does not react with water, its oxide and hydroxide are amphoteric, and it shows diagonal relationship with aluminium (both form covalent compounds, both have amphoteric oxides, both form carbides that give methane with water). Mg burns in air with a dazzling white flame: 2Mg + O₂ → 2MgO. Compounds of calcium: CaO (quicklime) is formed by calcination of limestone (CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂). Ca(OH)₂ (slaked lime) is formed by adding water to CaO. CaCO₃ exists as calcite and aragonite. CaSO₄·½H₂O is plaster of Paris (sets by forming CaSO₄·2H₂O, gypsum). MgSO₄·7H₂O is Epsom salt. MgCO₃ is used as an antacid. Cement is a mixture of calcium silicates and aluminates obtained by heating limestone with clay.",

      "explanation_correct": "Caesium has the lowest ionisation enthalpy among alkali metals (375.7 kJ/mol). Down Group 1, atomic size increases due to addition of new electron shells, and the outermost electron is farther from the nucleus with greater shielding. This makes it progressively easier to remove the valence electron: Li (520) > Na (496) > K (419) > Rb (403) > Cs (376) kJ/mol.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Lithium has the highest ionisation enthalpy in the group due to its smallest size. Ionisation enthalpy decreases steadily down the group as atomic radius increases and the valence electron becomes easier to remove. Caesium, being the largest, has the lowest IE."

Sodium tarnishes within seconds in air, forming a layer of oxide (Na₂O) and then hydroxide (NaOH, which absorbs moisture). To prevent this, they are stored under kerosene oil (an inert hydrocarbon liquid) that keeps them isolated from air and moisture. Lithium, being lighter than kerosene, is stored in paraffin wax.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Alkali metals are not volatile at room temperature (they are solid metals). They form strongly basic (not acidic) solutions with water. While Li forms Li₃N with nitrogen, this is not explosive and is not the primary reason for storage under kerosene. The main reason is their vigorous reaction with atmospheric O₂ and H₂O."

The solvated electrons (ammoniated electrons) are responsible for the intense blue colour of dilute solutions. These solvated electrons also make the solution paramagnetic and an excellent reducing agent. At higher concentrations, the solution becomes bronze/copper-coloured and diamagnetic due to clustering of solvated electrons.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Metal amides (MNH₂) form slowly as a side reaction but do not cause the blue colour. There is no metal-ammonia complex ion formation. The metal dissolves as ions, not colloidal particles. The blue colour is specifically due to the absorption of light in the visible region by solvated (ammoniated) electrons."

      "explanation_correct": "Both are true and the Reason correctly explains the Assertion. The standard electrode potential depends on sublimation energy + ionisation energy + hydration energy. Although Li has the highest IE among alkali metals (520 kJ/mol), its very small ionic radius (76 pm) leads to an exceptionally high hydration enthalpy (−520 kJ/mol), which more than compensates for the high IE. The overall result is the most negative E° value, making Li the strongest reducing agent in aqueous solution.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The Assertion is factually true (Li has E° = −3.04 V, most negative). The Reason is also true (Li⁺ has very high hydration enthalpy due to small size). And the Reason correctly explains why Li has the most negative E° despite its high IE — the enormous energy released during hydration compensates."
