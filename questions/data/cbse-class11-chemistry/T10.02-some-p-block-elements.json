    "text": "The p-block elements are those in which the last electron enters a p-orbital. They include Groups 13 to 18 (six groups). The general electronic configuration is ns² np¹⁻⁶. The NCERT Class 11 syllabus covers Group 13 (boron family: B, Al, Ga, In, Tl) and Group 14 (carbon family: C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb). Group 13 elements have the general configuration ns² np¹. Boron is a non-metal, aluminium is a metal, and the metallic character increases down the group (Ga, In, Tl are metals). The oxidation states are +3 and +1. The stability of the +1 oxidation state increases down the group due to the inert pair effect (the ns² electrons become reluctant to participate in bonding as we go down). Tl⁺ is more stable than Tl³⁺. Boron shows anomalous behaviour due to its small size, high ionisation enthalpy, and absence of d-orbitals: it is a non-metal, forms covalent compounds, has a very high melting point, and forms borates and borohydrides rather than simple B³⁺ ions. Borax (Na₂B₄O₇·10H₂O) is an important compound of boron. Its structure contains two tetrahedral and two trigonal planar boron atoms bridged by oxygen. In water, borax is hydrolysed to give an alkaline solution: Na₂B₄O₇ + 7H₂O → 2NaOH + 4H₃BO₃. On heating, borax first swells (loses water), then melts to a clear glassy bead of sodium metaborate and boric anhydride: Na₂B₄O₇ → 2NaBO₂ + B₂O₃. This bead test is used in qualitative analysis — coloured metal metaborates form when metal salts are heated with the borax bead (e.g., Co gives blue, Cr gives green, Cu gives blue in oxidising flame). Orthoboric acid (H₃BO₃) is a weak monobasic acid that does not donate a proton but accepts OH⁻ from water: H₃BO₃ + H₂O → [B(OH)₄]⁻ + H⁺. It has a layered structure with B(OH)₃ units held by hydrogen bonds. On heating: H₃BO₃ →(373K) HBO₂ (metaboric acid) →(red heat) B₂O₃ (boric anhydride). Diborane (B₂H₆) is the simplest boron hydride. It has a unique structure with four terminal B–H bonds (2-centre-2-electron, 2c-2e) and two bridging B–H–B bonds (3-centre-2-electron, 3c-2e banana bonds). It is prepared by: 2BF₃ + 6NaH → B₂H₆ + 6NaF, or from NaBH₄ + I₂. B₂H₆ burns in air: B₂H₆ + 3O₂ → B₂O₃ + 3H₂O (highly exothermic). It reacts with Lewis bases to form adducts: B₂H₆ + 2NMe₃ → 2BH₃·NMe₃. Aluminium is the most abundant metal in Earth's crust. It is extracted from bauxite (Al₂O₃·2H₂O) by the Bayer process (purification) followed by the Hall-Héroult process (electrolysis of Al₂O₃ dissolved in molten cryolite Na₃AlF₆ at ~1200 K). Al is a reactive metal but is rendered passive by a thin protective oxide layer (Al₂O₃). Al₂O₃ is amphoteric: Al₂O₃ + 6HCl → 2AlCl₃ + 3H₂O; Al₂O₃ + 2NaOH → 2NaAlO₂ + H₂O. AlCl₃ is a covalent compound that exists as a dimer Al₂Cl₆ with bridging chlorine atoms. Aluminium reacts with NaOH: 2Al + 2NaOH + 2H₂O → 2NaAlO₂ + 3H₂↑. Group 14 elements have the configuration ns² np². Carbon is a non-metal, silicon is a metalloid, germanium is a metalloid, tin and lead are metals. Oxidation states are +4 and +2; the stability of +2 increases down the group (inert pair effect — Pb²⁺ is more stable than Pb⁴⁺). Carbon shows catenation (ability to form long chains of C–C bonds) to the greatest extent among all elements due to the strength of the C–C bond (348 kJ/mol). Carbon exists as three allotropes: diamond (sp³, tetrahedral, hardest substance, insulator), graphite (sp², layered hexagonal, soft lubricant, conductor due to delocalised π-electrons), and fullerene (C₆₀, sp², spherical cage, 20 hexagons and 12 pentagons). Silicon exists as a network solid (sp³) with Si–Si bonds weaker than C–C. Oxides of carbon: CO is a neutral oxide (not acidic or basic), a powerful reducing agent, and a ligand in metal carbonyls. CO₂ is a linear molecule (O=C=O, sp hybridised carbon), an acidic oxide that dissolves in water to form carbonic acid (CO₂ + H₂O → H₂CO₃). Silicon dioxide (SiO₂, silica) is a covalent network solid with each Si bonded tetrahedrally to four oxygen atoms — unlike CO₂ which is a discrete molecule. This difference is because carbon forms strong pπ-pπ double bonds (C=O) while silicon cannot form effective pπ-pπ bonds due to its larger size, so it forms single Si–O–Si bonds instead. Silicones are synthetic organosilicon polymers with (R₂SiO)ₙ repeating units, with alternating Si–O–Si backbone. They are water repellent, heat resistant, and used as sealants, lubricants, and in medical implants. Zeolites are hydrated aluminosilicates with open framework structures containing channels and cavities occupied by water molecules and cations. General formula: Mₓ/ₙ[(AlO₂)ₓ(SiO₂)ᵧ]·mH₂O. They are used as molecular sieves (selective absorption based on pore size), shape-selective catalysts (e.g., ZSM-5 in petrochemistry), water softeners (ion exchange), and in detergent builders.",

In Group 13, as we go from B to Tl, the +1 oxidation state becomes more stable (Tl⁺ is more stable than Tl³⁺). This is because the 6s² electrons in Tl are held tightly due to poor shielding by inner d and f electrons, making them less available for bonding.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Boron does not form B³⁺ ions due to very high ionisation energy, but this is not the inert pair effect. The inert pair effect specifically explains the increasing stability of the lower oxidation state (+1 for Group 13) as we go down the group. It has nothing to do with d-electron pairing in transition metals."

These factors make boron exclusively covalent, a non-metal, and very different from the metallic members Al, Ga, In, Tl.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Tl has a large (not small) atomic size. The third ionisation enthalpy is actually high (not low), contributing to the reluctance to form Tl³⁺. Tl³⁺ being too large is not the reason — it is actually smaller than Tl⁺. The inert pair effect is the correct explanation."

The 3d electrons provide poor shielding of the nuclear charge (d-orbitals have diffuse shapes with poor penetration). This means the outer 4s and 4p electrons experience a higher effective nuclear charge than expected, pulling them closer to the nucleus and reducing the atomic radius. This makes Ga slightly smaller than Al despite being in the next period.",

Higher principal quantum number normally increases atomic radius, but here the poor d-electron shielding counteracts this. Al does not have d-electrons.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation_correct": "The bond length increases as bond order decreases. CO has a triple bond (bond order 3, bond length 113 pm). CO₂ has double bonds (bond order 2, C=O bond length 116 pm). CO₃²⁻ has resonance-delocalised bonds with bond order 4/3 ≈ 1.33 (bond length ~129 pm). Therefore, the order of increasing bond length is: CO (113 pm) < CO₂ (116 pm) < CO₃²⁻ (129 pm), which corresponds to decreasing bond order: 3 > 2 > 1.33.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Bond length is inversely proportional to bond order. CO has the highest bond order (3) and shortest bond. CO₃²⁻ has the lowest bond order (1.33) and longest bond. CO₂ is intermediate. The order CO < CO₂ < CO₃²⁻ for increasing bond length is correct."
