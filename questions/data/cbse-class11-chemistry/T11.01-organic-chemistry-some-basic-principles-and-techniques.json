    "text": "Organic chemistry is the study of compounds of carbon, which form the basis of all living organisms and many synthetic materials. Carbon is unique because of its tetravalency, catenation (ability to form long chains), and capacity to form multiple bonds. Organic compounds are classified based on their functional groups into families such as alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, carboxylic acids, and amines. The IUPAC system provides a systematic method for naming compounds by identifying the longest carbon chain, numbering it to give substituents the lowest locants, and using standard prefixes and suffixes. Isomerism occurs when two or more compounds share the same molecular formula but differ in structure or spatial arrangement. Structural isomers differ in connectivity (chain, position, functional group, metamerism, and tautomerism), while stereoisomers differ in spatial arrangement (geometrical and optical isomerism). Electronic effects profoundly influence the reactivity of organic molecules. The inductive effect is the permanent displacement of sigma-bond electrons toward or away from an electronegative atom. The resonance (mesomeric) effect involves delocalisation of pi electrons across conjugated systems. Hyperconjugation is a stabilising interaction between a filled C-H sigma orbital and an adjacent empty or partially filled p orbital. The electromeric effect is a temporary complete transfer of pi electrons to one atom under the influence of an attacking reagent. Reaction intermediates are short-lived, highly reactive species formed during the course of a reaction. Carbocations are electron-deficient carbon species stabilised by hyperconjugation and resonance; carbanions carry a lone pair on carbon and are stabilised by electron-withdrawing groups; free radicals have an unpaired electron and are stabilised by hyperconjugation and resonance; carbenes have a divalent carbon with two non-bonding electrons. Purification methods include distillation, crystallisation, sublimation, differential extraction, and chromatography. Qualitative analysis detects elements (Lassaigne's test for N, S, halogens), while quantitative analysis determines percentage composition via Dumas method (nitrogen), Carius method (halogens, sulphur, phosphorus), and Liebig's method (carbon and hydrogen).",

While free radicals are also approximately planar (sp² hybridised), the p orbital in a free radical contains one electron — it is not empty. In a carbocation, the p orbital is completely empty.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Carbanions are sp³ hybridised with a pyramidal geometry (or sp² in some stabilised cases). Free radicals are nearly planar but their p orbital contains one unpaired electron, not empty. Only the carbocation has a truly empty p orbital perpendicular to its planar structure."
