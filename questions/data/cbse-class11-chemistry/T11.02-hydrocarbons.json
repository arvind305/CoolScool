    "text": "Hydrocarbons are organic compounds composed exclusively of carbon and hydrogen atoms. They are classified into four main categories: alkanes (saturated, single bonds only), alkenes (one or more C=C double bonds), alkynes (one or more C≡C triple bonds), and aromatic hydrocarbons (containing benzene rings or related structures). Alkanes (CₙH₂ₙ₊₂) are prepared by Wurtz reaction, Kolbe electrolysis, decarboxylation, and catalytic hydrogenation of alkenes/alkynes. They undergo substitution reactions (halogenation via free radical mechanism), combustion, and pyrolysis (cracking). Conformations of alkanes involve rotation about C–C single bonds; for ethane, the staggered conformation is most stable and the eclipsed is least stable due to torsional strain. Alkenes (CₙH₂ₙ) are prepared by dehydration of alcohols, dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides, and dehalogenation of vicinal dihalides. They undergo electrophilic addition reactions following Markovnikov's rule: the electrophile (H⁺) adds to the carbon with more H atoms, and the nucleophile adds to the carbon with fewer H atoms. Anti-Markovnikov addition occurs in the presence of peroxides (Kharash effect). Alkynes (CₙH₂ₙ₋₂) are prepared from calcium carbide, dehydrohalogenation of vicinal dihalides, and by the action of alkyl halides on sodium acetylide. Terminal alkynes are weakly acidic (pKa ~25) because the sp-hybridised carbon has greater s-character (50%), holding electrons closer to the nucleus and stabilising the conjugate base. Aromatic hydrocarbons contain benzene rings characterised by planarity, cyclic conjugation, and (4n+2) pi electrons (Huckel's rule). Benzene undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions including halogenation, nitration, sulphonation, Friedel-Crafts alkylation, and Friedel-Crafts acylation. The mechanism involves formation of an electrophile, attack on the pi cloud to form an arenium ion (sigma complex), and loss of a proton to restore aromaticity. Substituents on benzene are classified as activating (ortho-para directors, e.g., –OH, –NH₂, –CH₃) and deactivating (meta directors, e.g., –NO₂, –COOH, –CN), based on their electronic effects. Halogens are deactivating but ortho-para directing due to their +M effect overriding their −I effect for directing purposes.",

      "Alkanes have the general formula CₙH₂ₙ₊₂ and undergo substitution reactions (not addition).",
      "Wurtz reaction: 2R–X + 2Na → R–R + 2NaX (forms even-carbon alkanes in dry ether).",
      "In ethane conformations: staggered is most stable (lowest energy), eclipsed is least stable (highest torsional strain).",
      "Markovnikov's rule: in HX addition to unsymmetrical alkenes, H adds to the carbon with more H atoms.",
      "Anti-Markovnikov (Kharash) addition occurs with HBr in the presence of peroxides (free radical mechanism).",
      "Terminal alkynes are weakly acidic (pKa ~25) due to 50% s-character in the sp hybrid orbital holding the C–H bonding electrons.",

      "Benzene undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS): halogenation, nitration, sulphonation, Friedel-Crafts reactions.",
      "EAS mechanism: electrophile generation → electrophilic attack forming arenium ion (sigma complex) → proton loss restoring aromaticity.",
      "Ortho-para directors: electron-donating groups (–OH, –NH₂, –OR, –R) activate the ring and direct to ortho/para positions.",
      "Meta directors: electron-withdrawing groups (–NO₂, –CN, –COOH, –CHO) deactivate the ring and direct to the meta position.",
      "Halogens are ortho-para directing but ring deactivating: −I effect deactivates, +M effect directs to ortho/para."

      "explanation_correct": "The peroxide effect (anti-Markovnikov addition) is observed only with HBr. HCl does not show this effect because the Cl radical is not reactive enough to initiate the chain. HI does not show it because the I radical is too reactive and the chain terminates prematurely. Only HBr has the right balance of bond energy for sustained radical chain propagation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "HCl has too strong an H–Cl bond for the radical chain to propagate efficiently. HI has too weak an H–I bond, causing premature termination. The Kharash effect is unique to HBr because the propagation steps are both exothermic."

Friedel-Crafts reactions fail with rings bearing strong deactivating groups (–NO₂, –CN, –CHO, etc.).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Toluene has an activating methyl group and readily undergoes Friedel-Crafts reactions. Anisole (–OCH₃) is activated. Chlorobenzene, though deactivated, can still undergo Friedel-Crafts reactions under vigorous conditions. Only nitrobenzene is too deactivated."

      "explanation_incorrect": "1.34 Å is for a localised C=C double bond. 1.54 Å is for a C–C single bond. 1.20 Å is for a C≡C triple bond. Benzene's 1.39 Å bond length confirms that its bonds are neither purely single nor purely double — they are resonance-averaged."
