    "text": "Hydrocarbons are organic compounds composed exclusively of carbon and hydrogen atoms. They are classified into four main categories: alkanes (saturated, single bonds only), alkenes (one or more C=C double bonds), alkynes (one or more C≡C triple bonds), and aromatic hydrocarbons (containing benzene rings or related structures). Alkanes (CₙH₂ₙ₊₂) are prepared by Wurtz reaction, Kolbe electrolysis, decarboxylation, and catalytic hydrogenation of alkenes/alkynes. They undergo substitution reactions (halogenation via free radical mechanism), combustion, and pyrolysis (cracking). Conformations of alkanes involve rotation about C–C single bonds; for ethane, the staggered conformation is most stable and the eclipsed is least stable due to torsional strain. Alkenes (CₙH₂ₙ) are prepared by dehydration of alcohols, dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides, and dehalogenation of vicinal dihalides. They undergo electrophilic addition reactions following Markovnikov's rule: the electrophile (H⁺) adds to the carbon with more H atoms, and the nucleophile adds to the carbon with fewer H atoms. Anti-Markovnikov addition occurs in the presence of peroxides (Kharash effect). Alkynes (CₙH₂ₙ₋₂) are prepared from calcium carbide, dehydrohalogenation of vicinal dihalides, and by the action of alkyl halides on sodium acetylide. Terminal alkynes are weakly acidic (pKa ~25) because the sp-hybridised carbon has greater s-character (50%), holding electrons closer to the nucleus and stabilising the conjugate base. Aromatic hydrocarbons contain benzene rings characterised by planarity, cyclic conjugation, and (4n+2) pi electrons (Huckel's rule). Benzene undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS) reactions including halogenation, nitration, sulphonation, Friedel-Crafts alkylation, and Friedel-Crafts acylation. The mechanism involves formation of an electrophile, attack on the pi cloud to form an arenium ion (sigma complex), and loss of a proton to restore aromaticity. Substituents on benzene are classified as activating (ortho-para directors, e.g., –OH, –NH₂, –CH₃) and deactivating (meta directors, e.g., –NO₂, –COOH, –CN), based on their electronic effects. Halogens are deactivating but ortho-para directing due to their +M effect overriding their −I effect for directing purposes.",
    "rules": [
      "Alkanes have the general formula CₙH₂ₙ₊₂ and undergo substitution reactions (not addition).",
      "Wurtz reaction: 2R–X + 2Na → R–R + 2NaX (forms even-carbon alkanes in dry ether).",
      "In ethane conformations: staggered is most stable (lowest energy), eclipsed is least stable (highest torsional strain).",
      "Markovnikov's rule: in HX addition to unsymmetrical alkenes, H adds to the carbon with more H atoms.",
      "Anti-Markovnikov (Kharash) addition occurs with HBr in the presence of peroxides (free radical mechanism).",
      "Terminal alkynes are weakly acidic (pKa ~25) due to 50% s-character in the sp hybrid orbital holding the C–H bonding electrons.",
      "Huckel's rule for aromaticity: a planar, cyclic, fully conjugated system with (4n+2) pi electrons is aromatic.",
      "Benzene undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution (EAS): halogenation, nitration, sulphonation, Friedel-Crafts reactions.",
      "EAS mechanism: electrophile generation → electrophilic attack forming arenium ion (sigma complex) → proton loss restoring aromaticity.",
      "Ortho-para directors: electron-donating groups (–OH, –NH₂, –OR, –R) activate the ring and direct to ortho/para positions.",
      "Meta directors: electron-withdrawing groups (–NO₂, –CN, –COOH, –CHO) deactivate the ring and direct to the meta position.",
      "Halogens are ortho-para directing but ring deactivating: −I effect deactivates, +M effect directs to ortho/para."

      "explanation_correct": "Benzene has a resonance stabilisation energy of about 150 kJ/mol due to its delocalised (4n + 2) pi electron system. Electrophilic addition would permanently disrupt this aromatic sextet by consuming two pi electrons to form new sigma bonds, converting the aromatic ring into a non-aromatic cyclohexadiene. Electrophilic substitution, on the other hand, temporarily disrupts aromaticity in the arenium ion intermediate but restores it when a proton is lost in the final step. The thermodynamic drive to retain ~150 kJ/mol of stabilisation strongly favours substitution over addition.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Benzene does have pi electrons — it has 6 delocalised pi electrons that are actually attacked by electrophiles. C–H bonds in benzene are broken during substitution, so they are not too strong. Benzene is non-polar overall but its pi cloud is electron-rich and does interact with electrophiles. The key reason is preservation of aromatic stabilisation energy."

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "The –OCH₃ group has a strong +M (mesomeric/resonance) effect: a lone pair on the oxygen atom is conjugated into the benzene ring. When resonance structures are drawn, the additional electron density appears specifically at the ortho and para positions (not meta). This makes the ortho and para arenium ion intermediates more stable, so electrophilic attack is favoured at these positions. The +M effect overrides the weak −I (inductive) effect of oxygen.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Steric effects do not explain directing in this case — meta positions are not sterically blocked by –OCH₃. The –OCH₃ group donates electrons by resonance, it does not primarily withdraw by induction. The methyl group in –OCH₃ does not provide hyperconjugation to specific ring positions. The directing effect is due to resonance donation of the oxygen lone pair."
