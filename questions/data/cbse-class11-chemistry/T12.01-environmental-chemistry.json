    "text": "Environmental chemistry deals with the study of chemical phenomena occurring in the environment and the impact of human activities on the natural chemical balance. The environment consists of the atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere, and pollutants can affect all of these. Air pollution arises from gaseous pollutants (SO₂, NO₂, CO, O₃, hydrocarbons) and particulate matter (smoke, dust, fumes, mist). Pollutants are classified as primary (emitted directly from sources, e.g., CO, SO₂, NO) and secondary (formed by reactions of primary pollutants, e.g., O₃, PAN, smog). Classical smog (London smog) is a reducing mixture of smoke, fog, and SO₂ that occurs in cold, humid conditions. Photochemical smog (Los Angeles smog) is an oxidising mixture of O₃, PAN (peroxyacetyl nitrate), formaldehyde, and acrolein formed by the action of sunlight on NOₓ and hydrocarbons. The ozone layer in the stratosphere (15-35 km altitude) absorbs harmful UV radiation. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs, Freons) release chlorine radicals in the stratosphere that catalytically destroy ozone: Cl· + O₃ → ClO· + O₂; ClO· + O → Cl· + O₂. The ozone hole, most prominent over Antarctica, has led to international agreements like the Montreal Protocol to phase out CFCs. Acid rain has a pH below 5.6 due to dissolution of SO₂ and NOₓ forming H₂SO₄ and HNO₃. It damages aquatic life, forests, buildings (especially marble and limestone), and soil fertility. The greenhouse effect is the warming of Earth's surface due to absorption and re-emission of infrared radiation by greenhouse gases (CO₂, CH₄, N₂O, CFCs, O₃, water vapour). Rising concentrations of these gases are causing global warming, leading to climate change, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events. Water pollution is caused by pathogens, organic waste (measured by BOD — biochemical oxygen demand), chemical pollutants (heavy metals, pesticides), and eutrophication (excessive nutrient enrichment causing algal blooms). Soil pollution results from improper disposal of industrial waste, excessive use of fertilisers and pesticides, and non-biodegradable plastics. Green chemistry is the design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the generation and use of hazardous substances. Its 12 principles include waste prevention, atom economy, use of renewable feedstocks, catalysis over stoichiometric reagents, design for degradation, and real-time pollution prevention.",
