    "text": "Physics is a quantitative science that relies on measurements of physical quantities. A physical quantity is expressed as the product of a numerical value and a unit. The International System of Units (SI) defines seven base units: metre (m) for length, kilogram (kg) for mass, second (s) for time, ampere (A) for electric current, kelvin (K) for temperature, mole (mol) for amount of substance, and candela (cd) for luminous intensity. All other units are derived from these base units. Dimensional analysis involves expressing physical quantities in terms of the base dimensions [M], [L], [T], [A], [K], [mol], and [cd]. The dimensional formula of a quantity helps in checking the correctness of equations (principle of homogeneity), deriving relations between quantities, and converting units between systems. Significant figures in a measurement indicate its precision. Rules include: all non-zero digits are significant; zeros between non-zero digits are significant; leading zeros are not significant; trailing zeros after a decimal point are significant. In multiplication/division, the result has the same number of significant figures as the least precise factor. In addition/subtraction, the result has the same number of decimal places as the least precise term. Errors in measurement are classified as systematic (instrumental, personal, environmental) and random. The absolute error is |measured - true value|. The mean absolute error is the average of absolute errors. Relative error = mean absolute error / mean value. Percentage error = relative error × 100%. For propagation: in addition/subtraction, absolute errors add; in multiplication/division, relative errors add; for a quantity raised to power n, the relative error is n times the relative error of the base. Accuracy refers to how close a measurement is to the true value, while precision refers to the resolution or reproducibility. The least count of an instrument is the smallest measurement it can make: for a vernier calliper, LC = 1 MSD − 1 VSD; for a screw gauge, LC = pitch / number of divisions on circular scale.",
