  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Motion in a straight line (rectilinear motion) is the simplest form of motion. Position of an object is described relative to a chosen origin in a frame of reference. Distance is the total path length traversed (scalar, always positive), while displacement is the change in position (vector, can be positive, negative, or zero). Speed is the rate of change of distance, while velocity is the rate of change of displacement. Average velocity = total displacement / total time = (x₂ − x₁)/(t₂ − t₁). Instantaneous velocity is the limit of average velocity as the time interval approaches zero: v = dx/dt. Similarly, average speed = total distance / total time. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity: a = dv/dt = d²x/dt². For uniformly accelerated motion (constant acceleration), the three kinematic equations are: v = u + at, s = ut + ½at², and v² = u² + 2as, where u is initial velocity, v is final velocity, a is acceleration, t is time, and s is displacement. The displacement in the nth second is sₙ = u + a(2n−1)/2. Position-time graphs: slope gives velocity; velocity-time graphs: slope gives acceleration and area under the curve gives displacement. Free fall is motion under gravity alone with acceleration g ≈ 9.8 m/s² directed downward. For a body thrown vertically upward with velocity u, maximum height H = u²/(2g), time of ascent = u/g, and total time of flight = 2u/g. The body returns with the same speed it was thrown with.",
