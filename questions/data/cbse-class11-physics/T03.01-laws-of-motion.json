    "text": "Newton's laws of motion form the foundation of classical mechanics. The first law (law of inertia) states that a body remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by a net external force. Inertia is the tendency of a body to resist change in its state of motion and is measured by mass. Linear momentum p = mv is a vector quantity. Newton's second law states that the rate of change of momentum equals the net external force: F = dp/dt = ma (for constant mass). The impulse of a force is J = FΔt = Δp (change in momentum). Newton's third law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction; these act on different bodies. The law of conservation of momentum states that in the absence of external forces, total momentum of a system remains constant. This applies to collisions, explosions, and recoil. Friction is the force that opposes relative motion between surfaces. Static friction fs ≤ μsN prevents motion until the applied force exceeds fsmax = μsN. Kinetic friction fk = μkN acts during motion, where μk < μs. Rolling friction is much smaller than sliding friction. For circular motion, the net force toward the center provides centripetal force: F = mv²/r. On a banked road of angle θ, the optimal speed (no friction needed) is v = √(rg tan θ). A conical pendulum of length L and half-angle θ has period T = 2π√(L cos θ/g).",
