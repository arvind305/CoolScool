    "text": "Newton's universal law of gravitation states that every two particles attract each other with a force F = GMm/r², where G = 6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ N·m²/kg² is the universal gravitational constant. The gravitational force obeys the superposition principle: the net force on a particle is the vector sum of forces due to all other particles. The acceleration due to gravity at Earth's surface is g = GM/R². It varies with altitude h as g' = g(1 − 2h/R) for h << R, and with depth d as g' = g(1 − d/R). The gravitational potential energy of a mass m at distance r from mass M is U = −GMm/r. The gravitational potential is V = −GM/r. The escape velocity from Earth's surface is vₑ = √(2gR) ≈ 11.2 km/s. The orbital velocity of a satellite near the surface is v₀ = √(gR). For a satellite in circular orbit at height h, the orbital velocity is v = √(GM/(R+h)). The total energy of an orbiting satellite is E = −GMm/2r. Kepler's first law states planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus. Kepler's second law (law of areas) states the line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps equal areas in equal times, implying conservation of angular momentum. Kepler's third law states T² ∝ r³, i.e., the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis. A geostationary satellite orbits at about 36,000 km above the equator with a period of 24 hours.",
