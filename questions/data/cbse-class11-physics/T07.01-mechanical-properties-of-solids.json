    "text": "When an external force (called a deforming force) is applied to a solid body, the body changes its shape or size. The restoring force per unit area set up inside the body is called stress (σ = F/A), measured in pascals (Pa). The fractional change in dimension is called strain (ε = ΔL/L for longitudinal strain). Hooke's law states that, within the elastic limit, stress is directly proportional to strain: σ = Eε, where E is the modulus of elasticity. A stress-strain curve for a material shows distinct regions: the proportional limit (where Hooke's law holds), the elastic limit (beyond which permanent deformation begins), the yield point, and the breaking point. Young's modulus Y = longitudinal stress / longitudinal strain = (F/A)/(ΔL/L). Bulk modulus B = volumetric stress / volumetric strain = −VΔP/ΔV, where the negative sign ensures B is positive since volume decreases when pressure increases. Shear modulus (modulus of rigidity) G = shearing stress / shearing strain = (F/A)/θ, where θ is the angular displacement. Poisson's ratio σₚ = lateral strain / longitudinal strain = −(Δd/d)/(ΔL/L), and for most materials lies between 0 and 0.5. The elastic potential energy stored per unit volume in a deformed body is u = ½ × stress × strain, and the total elastic PE is U = ½ × stress × strain × volume.",
