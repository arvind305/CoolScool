    "text": "Fluid mechanics deals with the behaviour of liquids and gases. Pressure in a fluid at depth h is P = P₀ + ρgh, where P₀ is atmospheric pressure. Pascal's law states that a pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted undiminished to every part of the fluid and the walls of the container. This is the basis of hydraulic machines: F₁/A₁ = F₂/A₂. Archimedes' principle states that a body immersed in a fluid experiences a buoyant force equal to the weight of the displaced fluid: F_b = ρ_fluid × V_displaced × g. A body floats when its weight equals the buoyant force. For streamline (laminar) flow, the equation of continuity states A₁v₁ = A₂v₂ (conservation of mass). Bernoulli's theorem, based on energy conservation for ideal fluids, states P + ½ρv² + ρgh = constant along a streamline. Applications include the venturimeter, atomiser, and the Magnus effect. Viscosity is the internal friction of a fluid. Newton's law of viscosity gives F = ηA(dv/dx), where η is the coefficient of viscosity. Stokes' law gives the drag force on a sphere: F = 6πηrv. The terminal velocity of a sphere falling through a viscous fluid is v_t = 2r²(ρ − σ)g/9η. Surface tension (S) is the force per unit length along the surface of a liquid. Excess pressure inside a liquid drop is 2S/R, and inside a soap bubble is 4S/R. Capillary rise is h = 2S cosθ/(ρgr), where θ is the contact angle.",
