    "text": "Heat is a form of energy that flows from a body at higher temperature to one at lower temperature. Temperature is a measure of the degree of hotness or coldness of a body. Two systems in thermal contact that exchange no net heat are in thermal equilibrium (Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics). Temperature is measured on Celsius (0-100 between ice and steam points), Fahrenheit (32-212), and Kelvin (273.15-373.15) scales. Materials expand on heating: linear expansion ΔL = αLΔT, area expansion ΔA = 2αAΔT (β = 2α), and volume expansion ΔV = 3αVΔT (γ = 3α). The heat absorbed or released is Q = mcΔT, where c is the specific heat capacity. During a change of state, temperature remains constant and the heat exchanged is Q = mL, where L is the latent heat. Heat transfers by conduction (Q/t = KA(T₁ - T₂)/d), convection (bulk movement of fluid), and radiation (electromagnetic waves). Stefan-Boltzmann law gives E = σT⁴ for a black body. Newton's law of cooling states that the rate of cooling is proportional to the temperature difference between the body and its surroundings.",

When steam touches the skin, it first releases this large amount of latent heat as it condenses, and then the resulting water continues to transfer heat. This makes steam burns far more severe.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Steam and boiling water are at the same temperature (100 °C). The key difference is that steam releases 2260 kJ/kg of latent heat when it condenses on the skin before transferring heat as hot water. This extra energy makes steam burns much worse."

      "explanation_correct": "By Newton's law of cooling, the rate of cooling is proportional to (T - T₀). When the body is at 70-60 °C, the average excess temperature over surroundings is (65 - 25) = 40 °C, compared to (75 - 25) = 50 °C for the first interval. Since the excess temperature is smaller, the rate of cooling is slower, so it takes more than 5 minutes to cool through the same 10 °C interval.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "As the body cools, the temperature difference with the surroundings decreases, and Newton's law says the cooling rate decreases proportionally. So each successive equal drop in temperature takes longer. The time to cool from 70 to 60 °C is more than 5 minutes."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "The Stefan-Boltzmann law states that the net radiative power loss is proportional to (T⁴ - T₀⁴). Using the algebraic identity T⁴ - T₀⁴ = (T - T₀)(T + T₀)(T² + T₀²), when (T - T₀) is small compared to T₀, the factors (T + T₀) ≈ 2T₀ and (T² + T₀²) ≈ 2T₀² become approximately constant, giving (T⁴ - T₀⁴) ≈ 4T₀³(T - T₀). This linear approximation is Newton's law of cooling. For large temperature differences, the higher-order terms cannot be neglected, and Newton's law breaks down.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Newton's law (dT/dt ∝ T - T₀) is mathematically derived from the Stefan-Boltzmann law (E ∝ T⁴) as a first-order approximation. When T is close to T₀, the T⁴ dependence can be linearised: T⁴ - T₀⁴ ≈ 4T₀³(T - T₀). For large differences, this linearisation is inaccurate. Options A, C, and D describe incorrect limitations."
