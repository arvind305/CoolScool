    "text": "Thermodynamics deals with the concepts of heat and temperature and the interconversion of heat and other forms of energy. The zeroth law of thermodynamics states that if two systems are each in thermal equilibrium with a third system, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other — this is the basis for temperature measurement. The first law of thermodynamics is a statement of conservation of energy: ΔU = Q − W, where ΔU is the change in internal energy, Q is the heat supplied to the system, and W is the work done by the system. For an ideal gas, work done at constant pressure is W = PΔV. Thermodynamic processes include isothermal (constant temperature, PV = constant, W = nRT ln(V₂/V₁)), adiabatic (no heat exchange, PV^γ = constant), isobaric (constant pressure), and isochoric (constant volume). The specific heat capacity at constant pressure (Cp) and constant volume (Cv) are related by Cp − Cv = R, and γ = Cp/Cv. A heat engine converts heat into work, and a refrigerator transfers heat from a cold body to a hot body using external work. The Carnot engine is an ideal reversible engine operating between two temperatures with maximum efficiency η = 1 − T₂/T₁. The second law of thermodynamics has two equivalent statements: the Kelvin–Planck statement (no process can convert heat entirely into work in a cycle) and the Clausius statement (heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder to a hotter body).",
