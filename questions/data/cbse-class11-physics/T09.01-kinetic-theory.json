    "text": "The kinetic theory of gases explains the macroscopic properties of gases (pressure, temperature, volume) in terms of the microscopic behaviour of molecules. An ideal gas obeys PV = nRT (n = number of moles, R = 8.314 J mol⁻¹ K⁻¹) which unifies Boyle's law (PV = const at constant T), Charles's law (V/T = const at constant P), Gay-Lussac's law (P/T = const at constant V), and Avogadro's law (V ∝ n at constant T, P). Kinetic theory assumes a large number of identical molecules in random motion with perfectly elastic collisions and negligible intermolecular forces, yielding pressure P = (1/3)ρv²_rms. The average translational kinetic energy per molecule is (3/2)kT (k = R/Nₐ = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J K⁻¹), directly proportional to absolute temperature. Three characteristic speeds are: v_rms = √(3kT/m), v_avg = √(8kT/πm), and v_mp = √(2kT/m), in the ratio 1.225 : 1.128 : 1. The law of equipartition of energy assigns (1/2)kT per degree of freedom: monoatomic gases have f = 3 (translational only), diatomic gases at moderate T have f = 5 (3 translational + 2 rotational), and polyatomic nonlinear gases have f = 6. Accordingly Cᵥ = (f/2)R and γ = Cₚ/Cᵥ = 1 + 2/f. The mean free path λ = 1/(√2 π n d²), where n is the number density and d is the molecular diameter.",
