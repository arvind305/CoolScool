    "text": "Oscillatory motion is a periodic motion in which a body moves back and forth about a fixed equilibrium position. Simple harmonic motion (SHM) is a special type of oscillatory motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement from the mean position and is directed towards it: F = -kx. The displacement in SHM is given by x = A sin(wt + phi), where A is the amplitude, w is the angular frequency, and phi is the initial phase. The velocity is v = Aw cos(wt + phi) and acceleration is a = -w^2 x. The time period T = 2pi/w and frequency f = 1/T. The kinetic energy is KE = (1/2)mw^2(A^2 - x^2), potential energy is PE = (1/2)mw^2 x^2, and total energy TE = (1/2)mw^2 A^2 remains constant. For a spring-mass system, T = 2pi sqrt(m/k). For a simple pendulum, T = 2pi sqrt(l/g). Springs in series combine as 1/k_eff = 1/k1 + 1/k2, and in parallel as k_eff = k1 + k2. In damped oscillations, amplitude decreases over time due to resistive forces. In forced oscillations, an external periodic force drives the system, and resonance occurs when the driving frequency matches the natural frequency, producing maximum amplitude.",

      "explanation_correct": "This is true. Greater damping dissipates more energy per cycle, which limits the maximum amplitude achievable at resonance. With very heavy damping, the resonance peak becomes broad and flat with a reduced maximum amplitude.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement is true. Damping opposes the build-up of amplitude. More damping means more energy dissipation, leading to a smaller resonance amplitude."

      "explanation_incorrect": "When the driving frequency matches the natural frequency, the system absorbs energy most efficiently, resulting in maximum amplitude. This phenomenon is called resonance."

      "explanation_correct": "A freely falling body under gravity is not oscillatory motion at all, so resonance does not apply. Tuning a radio (electromagnetic resonance), shattering glass (acoustic resonance), and bridge vibration at natural frequency are all examples of resonance.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Free fall is linear motion under gravity with no oscillation or periodic driving force. All other options involve a system being driven at or near its natural frequency, which is resonance."
