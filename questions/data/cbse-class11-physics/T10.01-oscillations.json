    "text": "Oscillatory motion is a periodic motion in which a body moves back and forth about a fixed equilibrium position. Simple harmonic motion (SHM) is a special type of oscillatory motion where the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement from the mean position and is directed towards it: F = -kx. The displacement in SHM is given by x = A sin(wt + phi), where A is the amplitude, w is the angular frequency, and phi is the initial phase. The velocity is v = Aw cos(wt + phi) and acceleration is a = -w^2 x. The time period T = 2pi/w and frequency f = 1/T. The kinetic energy is KE = (1/2)mw^2(A^2 - x^2), potential energy is PE = (1/2)mw^2 x^2, and total energy TE = (1/2)mw^2 A^2 remains constant. For a spring-mass system, T = 2pi sqrt(m/k). For a simple pendulum, T = 2pi sqrt(l/g). Springs in series combine as 1/k_eff = 1/k1 + 1/k2, and in parallel as k_eff = k1 + k2. In damped oscillations, amplitude decreases over time due to resistive forces. In forced oscillations, an external periodic force drives the system, and resonance occurs when the driving frequency matches the natural frequency, producing maximum amplitude.",
