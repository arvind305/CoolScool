    "text": "A wave is a disturbance that transfers energy without transferring matter. Waves are classified as transverse (particle displacement perpendicular to propagation, e.g. waves on a string) and longitudinal (particle displacement along propagation, e.g. sound waves). A sinusoidal travelling wave is described by y = A sin(kx - wt), where A is amplitude, k = 2pi/lambda is the angular wave number, and w = 2pi f is the angular frequency; the wave speed follows v = f lambda. The speed of sound in a gas is given by Newton's formula v = sqrt(P/rho), corrected by Laplace to v = sqrt(gamma P/rho) where gamma is the ratio of specific heats. Sound travels fastest in solids, then liquids, then gases. When two waves overlap, the principle of superposition states the resultant displacement is the algebraic sum of individual displacements. Standing (stationary) waves form when two identical waves travelling in opposite directions superpose; they have fixed nodes (zero displacement) and antinodes (maximum displacement). A stretched string of length L fixed at both ends vibrates in harmonics with frequencies n v/(2L) for n = 1, 2, 3, ... An open organ pipe supports all harmonics f_n = n v/(2L), while a closed pipe supports only odd harmonics f_n = n v/(4L), n = 1, 3, 5, ... When two waves of slightly different frequencies f1 and f2 superpose, beats are heard at frequency f_beat = |f1 - f2|. The Doppler effect describes the apparent change in frequency when there is relative motion between source and observer: f' = f (v +/- v_o) / (v -/+ v_s), where the upper signs apply when source and observer move toward each other and the lower signs when they move apart.",

      "Speed of sound in an ideal gas: v = sqrt(gamma P / rho) (Laplace correction); Newton's uncorrected formula v = sqrt(P/rho) underestimates the speed because sound propagation is adiabatic, not isothermal.",

The physical reason is that lighter molecules move faster at the same temperature, enabling quicker energy transfer through collisions.",

The source-moving case produces a larger shift because it changes the effective wavelength in the medium, whereas observer motion only changes the relative encounter rate with existing wavefronts. For small speeds (v_s, v_o << v), the difference is negligible, but at higher speeds the source-moving case gives a greater Doppler shift.",
