    "text": "A set is a well-defined collection of distinct objects called elements or members. Sets can be represented in roster form (listing all elements) or set-builder form (describing the property of elements). Operations like union (∪), intersection (∩), difference (−), and complement (A') allow combining or comparing sets. Venn diagrams provide visual representation of set relationships. De Morgan's laws state that (A∪B)' = A'∩B' and (A∩B)' = A'∪B'.",
