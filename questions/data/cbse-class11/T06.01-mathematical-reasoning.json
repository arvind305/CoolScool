  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Mathematical reasoning involves analyzing statements and their logical structure. A statement (proposition) is a sentence that is either true or false, but not both. Compound statements are formed using connectives: 'and' (conjunction), 'or' (disjunction), 'if-then' (conditional/implication), 'if and only if' (biconditional). The negation of a statement p is 'not p'. The converse of 'if p then q' is 'if q then p'. The contrapositive is 'if not q then not p'. Quantifiers include 'for all' (∀) and 'there exists' (∃).",
    "rules": [
      "Negation: ~p is true when p is false and vice versa",
      "Conjunction (p ∧ q): true only when both p and q are true",
      "Disjunction (p ∨ q): true when at least one is true",
      "Conditional (p → q): false only when p is true and q is false",
      "Contrapositive of (p → q) is (~q → ~p) — logically equivalent"
