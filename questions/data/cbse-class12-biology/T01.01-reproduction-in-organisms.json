  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Reproduction is the biological process by which organisms produce offspring, ensuring the continuity of species. It is broadly classified into asexual and sexual reproduction. Asexual reproduction involves a single parent and produces genetically identical offspring (clones). Common modes include binary fission (Amoeba, bacteria), sporulation (Penicillium, mosses), budding (yeast, Hydra), fragmentation (Spirogyra, Planaria), and vegetative propagation in plants (runners, rhizomes, tubers). Organisms like Bryophyllum reproduce via adventitious buds on leaves. Sexual reproduction involves the formation and fusion of male and female gametes (syngamy), producing genetically diverse offspring. The three phases of sexual reproduction are pre-fertilisation (gametogenesis and gamete transfer), fertilisation (fusion of gametes to form a zygote), and post-fertilisation (zygote development into an embryo). Organisms may be unisexual (dioecious) having separate sexes, or bisexual (monoecious/hermaphrodite) possessing both male and female reproductive organs. Every organism has a definite life span, from a few days (mayfly) to thousands of years (banyan tree). Some organisms show both asexual and sexual reproduction depending on conditions. The life cycle of an organism includes juvenile, reproductive, and senescent phases. Meiosis is essential in sexual reproduction as it halves the chromosome number, which is restored upon fertilisation, maintaining chromosome constancy across generations.",
    "rules": [
      "Asexual reproduction produces genetically identical offspring (clones) from a single parent",
      "Binary fission: parent body divides into two equal halves (e.g., Amoeba, Paramecium, bacteria)",
      "Budding: a bud develops as an outgrowth and separates to form a new organism (e.g., yeast, Hydra)",
      "Sporulation: spores are asexual reproductive units that germinate under favourable conditions (e.g., Penicillium, Rhizopus)",
      "Fragmentation: parent body breaks into fragments, each growing into a new organism (e.g., Spirogyra, Planaria)",
      "Vegetative propagation uses vegetative parts like runners, tubers, rhizomes, suckers for plant reproduction",
      "Sexual reproduction involves formation and fusion of gametes (syngamy) leading to genetic variation",
      "Gametes are haploid (n) and their fusion forms a diploid zygote (2n)",
      "Organisms can be unisexual (dioecious) or bisexual (monoecious/hermaphrodite)",
      "Life span of organisms varies widely: mayfly (1-2 days) to banyan tree (hundreds of years)",
      "Meiosis during gametogenesis halves chromosome number, maintaining constancy across generations",
      "Post-fertilisation events include zygote development into embryo (embryogenesis)"

There is no natural death in the conventional sense as the parent body continues in the form of its daughter cells.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "They can die from environmental factors. They do not have truly infinite life spans. They cannot survive all conditions. The concept of 'immortality' here refers to the absence of a natural death event since the parent becomes the offspring."
