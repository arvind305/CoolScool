  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Sexual reproduction in flowering plants (angiosperms) involves the flower as the reproductive organ. A typical flower has four whorls: calyx (sepals), corolla (petals), androecium (stamens - male), and gynoecium (pistil - female). Microsporogenesis occurs in the anther where microspore mother cells undergo meiosis to form microspore tetrads, which develop into pollen grains (male gametophytes). Each mature pollen grain has a two-celled structure with a generative cell and a vegetative (tube) cell, enclosed by exine (sporopollenin) and intine. Megasporogenesis occurs in the ovule where the megaspore mother cell undergoes meiosis forming four megaspores, of which usually one functional megaspore develops into the embryo sac (female gametophyte) by three successive mitotic divisions, forming a 7-celled, 8-nucleate structure. Pollination is the transfer of pollen from anther to stigma, occurring as self-pollination (autogamy) or cross-pollination (allogamy/xenogamy). Outbreeding devices include self-incompatibility, dichogamy, herkogamy, and dioecy. After pollination, pollen germinates on the stigma, the pollen tube grows through the style, and double fertilisation occurs: one sperm fuses with the egg (forming the diploid zygote) and the other fuses with the two polar nuclei (forming the triploid primary endosperm nucleus). The zygote develops into the embryo, ovules into seeds, and the ovary into the fruit. Apomixis is seed formation without fertilisation, polyembryony involves multiple embryos in a seed, and parthenocarpy produces seedless fruits.",

This means hybrid vigour (heterosis) can be maintained across generations without the segregation that occurs in sexually produced seeds, saving the cost of producing hybrid seeds each year.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Seedless fruit production is parthenocarpy, not apomixis. Apomixis decreases genetic variation as offspring are clones. It has no relation to irrigation needs. Its key value is maintaining hybrid vigour."
