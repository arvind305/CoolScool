  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Human reproduction is sexual, involving the production and fusion of gametes by the male and female reproductive systems. The male reproductive system consists of a pair of testes (located in the scrotum for temperature regulation), accessory ducts (rete testis, vasa efferentia, epididymis, vas deferens, ejaculatory duct, urethra), and accessory glands (seminal vesicles, prostate gland, bulbourethral glands). Seminiferous tubules in the testes contain spermatogonia and Sertoli cells; interstitial cells (Leydig cells) produce testosterone. Spermatogenesis converts spermatogonia (2n) through spermatocytes to spermatids (n) by meiosis, followed by spermiogenesis to form mature spermatozoa. The female reproductive system consists of a pair of ovaries, oviducts (fallopian tubes with fimbriae, ampulla, and isthmus), uterus, cervix, and vagina. Oogenesis begins during foetal development, with primary oocytes arrested in prophase I until puberty. The menstrual cycle (average 28 days) has menstrual, follicular, ovulatory, and luteal phases regulated by GnRH, FSH, LH, oestrogen, and progesterone. Fertilisation occurs in the ampulla of the fallopian tube. The zygote undergoes cleavage to form a blastocyst, which implants in the endometrium. The placenta develops as the structural and functional connection between the foetus and the mother. Pregnancy lasts approximately 266 days (38 weeks). Parturition is triggered by signals from the fully developed foetus and involves oxytocin-induced uterine contractions. Lactation begins after parturition, with colostrum providing initial antibodies.",
    "rules": [
      "Testes are located in the scrotum to maintain a temperature 2-3 degrees C lower than body temperature for spermatogenesis",
      "Seminiferous tubules contain spermatogonia (germ cells) and Sertoli cells (nurse cells); Leydig cells in interstitial spaces produce testosterone",
      "Spermatogenesis: spermatogonium (2n) -> primary spermatocyte (2n) -> secondary spermatocytes (n) -> spermatids (n) -> spermatozoa",
      "Oogenesis: oogonium (2n) -> primary oocyte (2n, arrested in prophase I) -> secondary oocyte (n) + first polar body; secondary oocyte completes meiosis II only upon fertilisation",
      "Menstrual cycle averages 28 days: menstrual phase (1-5 days), follicular phase (6-13 days), ovulation (day 14), luteal phase (15-28 days)",
      "FSH stimulates follicular development; LH surge triggers ovulation; progesterone from corpus luteum maintains the endometrium",
      "Fertilisation occurs in the ampulla-isthmus junction of the fallopian tube; only one sperm fertilises the egg",
      "Cleavage divisions form morula then blastocyst; trophoblast implants in the endometrium (implantation)",
      "Placenta facilitates nutrient, gas, and waste exchange between mother and foetus; also produces hCG, hPL, oestrogen, and progesterone",
      "Pregnancy (gestation) lasts about 9 months (266 days); parturition involves oxytocin-induced uterine contractions (positive feedback)",
      "Colostrum (initial milk) contains antibodies (IgA) providing passive immunity to the newborn"

      "explanation_correct": "hCG, produced by the trophoblast of the implanting blastocyst, maintains the corpus luteum in the ovary, preventing its degeneration. This ensures continued secretion of progesterone, which is essential for maintaining the endometrium and supporting early pregnancy. hCG is also the basis for pregnancy tests.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Ovulation is triggered by LH, not hCG. Uterine contractions are caused by oxytocin. Lactation is initiated by prolactin. hCG's critical role is maintaining the corpus luteum for progesterone production."
