    "text": "Reproductive health refers to the total well-being in all aspects of reproduction, including physical, emotional, behavioural, and social dimensions. India launched the Family Planning Programme in 1951 (the first country to do so) to address population growth. This was renamed the Reproductive and Child Health (RCH) Programme. Key strategies include creating awareness about reproduction-related aspects, providing education about puberty and reproductive organs, promoting safe and hygienic sexual practices, and making contraception accessible. Population explosion is a major concern; India's population crossed 1 billion in 2000. Contraceptive methods include natural methods (periodic abstinence, coitus interruptus, lactational amenorrhoea), barrier methods (condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps), IUDs (copper-releasing like CuT, Cu7, Multiload; hormone-releasing like Progestasert, LNG-20), oral contraceptives (pills containing synthetic progestogen or oestrogen-progestogen combinations), injectables and implants (e.g., Saheli containing centchroman), surgical methods (vasectomy in males, tubectomy in females). Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) is legal in India up to 20 weeks with medical advice. Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs/STIs) include gonorrhoea, syphilis, chlamydiasis, genital herpes, genital warts, hepatitis B, and HIV/AIDS. Infertility can be managed through assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as IVF-ET (test tube baby), ZIFT, GIFT, ICSI, and AI (artificial insemination). Amniocentesis is a prenatal diagnostic technique that has been banned for sex determination to prevent female foeticide.",

      "Barrier methods physically prevent sperm from reaching the egg: condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps, vaults",

      "explanation_incorrect": "If both rates decreased equally, there would be no explosion. An increase in death rate would reduce population. Immigration is not the primary factor. The birth-death rate gap is the main cause."

Ovulation occurs around day 14, and the ovum and sperm can survive for a few days, making this window fertile.",
