  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Genetics is the branch of biology that deals with the study of heredity and variation. Gregor Mendel, the father of genetics, conducted hybridisation experiments on garden pea (Pisum sativum) and formulated three laws of inheritance. The law of dominance states that when two organisms differing in a pair of contrasting characters are crossed, only one form (dominant) appears in the F1 generation while the other (recessive) remains hidden. The law of segregation (purity of gametes) states that alleles of a gene separate during gamete formation so that each gamete receives only one allele. The law of independent assortment states that alleles of different genes assort independently during gamete formation, provided the genes are on different chromosomes. A monohybrid cross involves one character and gives a 3:1 phenotypic ratio in F2; a dihybrid cross involves two characters and gives a 9:3:3:1 ratio in F2. A test cross is used to determine the genotype of a dominant phenotype individual by crossing it with a homozygous recessive.\n\nSometimes Mendelian ratios are modified due to phenomena such as incomplete dominance (e.g., pink flower in snapdragon, 1:2:1 ratio), codominance (e.g., ABO blood groups where both alleles express equally), multiple alleles (e.g., ABO blood group governed by three alleles IA, IB, and i), and pleiotropy (e.g., sickle cell anaemia where a single gene affects multiple traits). Sex determination follows the XX-XY mechanism in humans and Drosophila, while birds follow the ZW-ZZ system. Sex-linked traits are controlled by genes located on sex chromosomes; examples include colour blindness and haemophilia, which are X-linked recessive disorders and more common in males. Chromosomal disorders arise from errors in cell division: aneuploidy includes conditions like Down syndrome (trisomy 21), Turner syndrome (45, XO), and Klinefelter syndrome (47, XXY). Pedigree analysis is a method to trace the inheritance pattern of a trait through successive generations using standard symbols.",
