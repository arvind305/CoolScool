  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "The molecular basis of inheritance deals with the structure and function of DNA, the molecule of heredity. DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a double-stranded helical molecule composed of nucleotides, each consisting of a deoxyribose sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base (adenine, guanine, cytosine, or thymine). Watson and Crick (1953) proposed the double helix model based on X-ray crystallography data from Wilkins and Franklin. The two strands are antiparallel and complementary — A pairs with T (two hydrogen bonds) and G pairs with C (three hydrogen bonds). In eukaryotes, DNA is packaged with histone proteins to form nucleosomes, which coil further into chromatin and chromosomes. DNA replication is semi-conservative, as demonstrated by Meselson and Stahl's experiment using heavy nitrogen (15N) in E. coli. Replication proceeds bidirectionally from the origin with the help of enzymes like helicase, DNA polymerase, and ligase.\n\nThe central dogma of molecular biology describes the flow of genetic information: DNA → RNA → Protein. Transcription is the synthesis of RNA from a DNA template by RNA polymerase. In prokaryotes, a single RNA polymerase transcribes all types of RNA. In eukaryotes, RNA polymerase I (rRNA), II (mRNA), and III (tRNA) are involved. The genetic code is a triplet code (three nucleotides code for one amino acid), is degenerate (most amino acids are coded by more than one codon), is universal, is non-overlapping, and has start (AUG) and stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA). Translation occurs on ribosomes where mRNA is decoded to synthesise polypeptides. The lac operon in E. coli is a well-studied model of gene regulation in prokaryotes. The Human Genome Project (HGP), completed in 2003, determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the human genome, which contains approximately 3.1 billion base pairs. DNA fingerprinting, based on variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs), is used in forensic science and paternity testing.",
