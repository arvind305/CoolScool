    "text": "Evolution is the gradual change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. The origin of life is explained by the Oparin-Haldane hypothesis, which proposes that life arose from non-living organic molecules through chemical evolution on the primitive Earth. Stanley Miller and Harold Urey (1953) experimentally demonstrated that amino acids and other organic compounds could be synthesised from simple inorganic molecules (CH4, NH3, H2O, H2) under conditions simulating the early Earth's atmosphere (electric discharge representing lightning). Fossils provide the most direct evidence of past life and the history of evolution. Other evidences include comparative anatomy (homologous organs — same structure, different function; analogous organs — different structure, same function), vestigial organs, embryological similarities, and molecular homology.\n\nCharles Darwin proposed the theory of natural selection, stating that organisms with favourable variations are better adapted to survive and reproduce, leading to the survival of the fittest. Darwinian fitness refers to the reproductive fitness of an organism. The Hardy-Weinberg principle states that allele and genotype frequencies in a population remain constant across generations in the absence of evolutionary influences. The equation p² + 2pq + q² = 1 describes genotype frequencies, where p and q are allele frequencies. Factors that disturb Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium include gene flow, genetic drift, mutation, natural selection, and non-random mating. Natural selection can be stabilising (average individuals favoured), directional (one extreme favoured), or disruptive (both extremes favoured). Speciation occurs when populations become reproductively isolated — allopatric speciation involves geographic isolation, while sympatric speciation occurs without geographic separation. Adaptive radiation is the evolution of different species from a common ancestor in different directions, as seen in Darwin's finches on the Galapagos Islands and Australian marsupials. Human evolution traces through Dryopithecus, Ramapithecus, Australopithecus, Homo habilis, Homo erectus, Homo neanderthalensis, to modern Homo sapiens.",
