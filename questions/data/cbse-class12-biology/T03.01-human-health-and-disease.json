    "text": "Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease. Diseases are caused by a variety of pathogens including bacteria, viruses, protozoans, helminths, and fungi. Common bacterial diseases include typhoid (caused by Salmonella typhi, diagnosed by Widal test) and pneumonia (caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae). Important protozoan diseases include malaria (caused by Plasmodium species, transmitted by female Anopheles mosquito, characterised by recurring fever) and amoebiasis or amoebic dysentery (caused by Entamoeba histolytica). Helminthic diseases include ascariasis (caused by Ascaris lumbricoides, the round worm) and filariasis or elephantiasis (caused by Wuchereria bancrofti and W. malayi, transmitted by Culex mosquitoes). Ringworm is a common fungal infection caused by Microsporum, Trichophyton, and Epidermophyton. Prevention of diseases involves maintaining personal hygiene, proper sanitation, vector control, and vaccination.\n\nImmunity is the body's ability to resist pathogens. Innate immunity is non-specific and includes physical barriers (skin, mucous membranes), physiological barriers (acid in stomach, lysozyme in tears), cellular barriers (phagocytes, natural killer cells), and cytokine barriers (interferons). Adaptive (acquired) immunity is pathogen-specific and has memory. It is of two types: humoral immunity (mediated by B-lymphocytes and antibodies) and cell-mediated immunity (mediated by T-lymphocytes). Primary immune response is slower and weaker; secondary immune response is faster and stronger due to memory cells. Vaccination (immunisation) is based on the principle of immunological memory — weakened or killed pathogens (antigens) are introduced to stimulate antibody production without causing disease. AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) is caused by HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus), a retrovirus that attacks helper T-cells (CD4+), leading to immunodeficiency. Cancer is the uncontrolled proliferation of cells; it can be benign (non-spreading) or malignant (metastatic). Carcinogens include physical agents (UV rays, X-rays), chemical agents (tobacco smoke, aflatoxins), and biological agents (oncogenic viruses). Drugs and alcohol abuse adversely affect physical and mental health, and awareness programmes are essential for prevention.",
