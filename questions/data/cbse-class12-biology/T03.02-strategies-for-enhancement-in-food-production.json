  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Strategies for enhancement in food production encompass a range of biological techniques aimed at improving the quality and quantity of food from both plant and animal sources. Animal husbandry is the scientific management of animal livestock and includes dairy farm management, poultry farming, fisheries (aquaculture and pisciculture), apiculture (bee-keeping), and sericulture (silk production). Breeding strategies in animals include inbreeding (mating closely related animals to increase homozygosity), outbreeding (mating unrelated animals), cross-breeding (mating superior males of one breed with superior females of another), and interspecific hybridisation. MOET (Multiple Ovulation Embryo Transfer Technology) is used to improve the success rate of breeding programmes in cattle.\n\nPlant breeding is the purposeful manipulation of plant species to create improved varieties. The main steps include germplasm collection, evaluation and selection of parents, cross-hybridisation, selection and testing of superior recombinants, and release of improved varieties. Several disease-resistant varieties have been developed such as Himgiri wheat (resistant to leaf rust, stripe rust, and hill bunt) and Pusa Swarnim mustard (resistant to white rust). Tissue culture involves growing plant cells or tissues in sterile nutrient medium to regenerate whole plants (somaclones). Somatic hybridisation involves fusion of protoplasts from different species to form hybrid plants. Single cell protein (SCP) from organisms like Spirulina addresses protein-rich food demands. Biofortification aims at breeding crops with higher nutrient levels, such as iron-fortified rice and vitamin A-rich golden rice, to combat malnutrition.",
