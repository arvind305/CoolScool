    "text": "Microbes play an indispensable role in human welfare beyond causing diseases. In household products, Lactobacillus bacteria convert milk into curd by producing lactic acid. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) is used in bread-making (leavening) and brewing. Microbes are used to produce cheese (e.g., Penicillium roqueforti for Roquefort cheese), toddy (fermented sap), and various fermented foods like idli and dosa. Industrially, microbes produce antibiotics (Penicillium notatum produces penicillin), organic acids (Aspergillus niger for citric acid, Acetobacter aceti for acetic acid), enzymes (lipases, proteases, streptokinase), and alcoholic beverages.\n\nIn sewage treatment, microbes decompose organic matter through primary (physical settling) and secondary (biological) treatment. During secondary treatment, heterotrophic microbes in aeration tanks form activated sludge (flocs) that significantly reduce BOD (Biochemical Oxygen Demand). Anaerobic digestion of the sludge in digesters produces biogas. Methanogens (e.g., Methanobacterium) are responsible for biogas production, which contains predominantly methane, CO2, and H2S. As biocontrol agents, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) produces Cry proteins toxic to insect larvae, and baculoviruses are species-specific pathogens of insects used in IPM. As biofertilisers, Rhizobium (symbiotic nitrogen fixer in legumes), Azospirillum and Azotobacter (free-living nitrogen fixers), mycorrhizae (fungi that aid phosphorus absorption), and cyanobacteria like Anabaena and Nostoc (fix atmospheric nitrogen) enrich soil fertility naturally.",
