    "text": "Biotechnology deals with the techniques of using living organisms or their products for the benefit of humans. Modern biotechnology is based on two core techniques: genetic engineering (recombinant DNA technology) and bioprocess engineering (maintaining sterile conditions for growing microorganisms on large scale). Genetic engineering involves altering the chemistry of DNA and RNA to introduce these into host organisms to change their phenotype. The key tools include restriction enzymes (molecular scissors like EcoRI that cut DNA at specific palindromic sequences), DNA ligase (joins DNA fragments), vectors (vehicles that carry foreign DNA into host cells, e.g., pBR322 plasmid with ori, ampR, tetR genes), and host organisms (commonly E. coli).\n\nPCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) is an in vitro technique for amplifying specific DNA segments using thermostable Taq polymerase (from Thermus aquaticus), primers, and repeated cycles of denaturation (95 degrees C), annealing (55-65 degrees C), and extension (72 degrees C). Gel electrophoresis separates DNA fragments by size through an agarose gel matrix using an electric field; smaller fragments migrate faster. DNA bands are visualised using ethidium bromide staining under UV light. Bioreactors (especially stirred-tank bioreactors) are vessels used for large-scale production of biotechnological products under controlled conditions of temperature, pH, substrate, and oxygen. The steps in rDNA technology include: isolation of DNA, fragmentation using restriction enzymes, isolation of desired DNA fragment by gel electrophoresis, ligation into a vector, transfer into host cell, and selection/screening of transformants using selectable markers.",
