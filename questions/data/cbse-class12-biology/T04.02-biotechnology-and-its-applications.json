    "text": "Biotechnology has wide-ranging applications in agriculture, medicine, and diagnostics. In agriculture, genetically modified organisms (GMOs) have been developed for pest resistance, herbicide tolerance, and improved nutritional quality. Bt crops (e.g., Bt cotton) contain genes from Bacillus thuringiensis that encode Cry proteins (crystal proteins) toxic to specific insect pests. Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab are effective against cotton bollworms, while Cry1Ab is used against corn borers. The Cry proteins exist as inactive protoxins in the bacterium and are activated in the alkaline gut of insect larvae, forming pores in the midgut epithelium and causing cell lysis and death. Transgenic animals are animals whose genome has been altered by introducing foreign genes; they are used for studying gene regulation, as models for human diseases, and for producing biological products.\n\nIn medicine, recombinant DNA technology has enabled the production of human insulin (humulin) in E. coli, gene therapy for genetic disorders (ADA deficiency treated by introducing functional ADA gene into lymphocytes ex vivo), and molecular diagnostics using ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay) and PCR. ELISA uses antigen-antibody interaction to detect pathogens, while PCR amplifies trace amounts of pathogenic DNA for early diagnosis. Biosafety concerns regarding GMOs have led to regulatory frameworks. The Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) in India regulates the research and release of GMOs. Bioethics addresses moral questions surrounding genetic manipulation. Biopiracy refers to the unauthorised use of bio-resources and traditional knowledge by multinational companies, with notable cases involving neem, turmeric, and basmati rice patents.",

Mammalian stomachs are acidic (pH 1-3), so the protoxin cannot be activated and remains harmless.",
