    "text": "Ecology deals with the study of interactions among organisms and between organisms and their physical environment. Abiotic factors such as temperature, water, light, and soil significantly influence the distribution and survival of organisms. Organisms respond to abiotic stresses through regulation (homeostasis), conformation, migration, or suspension of metabolic activities (dormancy, hibernation, aestivation, diapause). Adaptations may be morphological (e.g., thick cuticle in desert plants), physiological (e.g., counter-current heat exchange in marine mammals), or behavioural (e.g., migration in birds). Allen's rule states that mammals from colder climates have shorter extremities to minimise heat loss.\n\nA population is a group of individuals of a same species inhabiting a given area at a given time. Key population attributes include population size (N), density, natality (birth rate), mortality (death rate), sex ratio, and age distribution. Age pyramids may be expanding, stable, or declining. Population growth follows two major models: exponential growth (J-shaped curve, dN/dt = rN, unlimited resources) and logistic growth (S-shaped or sigmoid curve, dN/dt = rN(K−N)/K, resource-limited). Here, r is the intrinsic rate of natural increase and K is the carrying capacity. Interspecific interactions include mutualism (+/+), competition (−/−), predation (+/−), parasitism (+/−), commensalism (+/0), and amensalism (−/0). Gause's competitive exclusion principle states that two species competing for the same resources cannot co-exist indefinitely.",

Deep-sea fish use bioluminescence in the dark ocean. The incorrect match is desert lizard with hibernation in summer — it should be aestivation if anything, or they simply bask and burrow."
