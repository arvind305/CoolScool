    "text": "An ecosystem is a functional unit of nature where living organisms interact with one another and with the surrounding physical environment. It comprises two main components: abiotic (inorganic substances, organic compounds, climatic factors) and biotic (producers, consumers, decomposers). Productivity refers to the rate of biomass production. Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) is the total rate of photosynthesis, Net Primary Productivity (NPP) is GPP minus respiration losses, and secondary productivity is the rate of formation of new organic matter by consumers. Energy flows unidirectionally through trophic levels: producers, primary consumers, secondary consumers, and tertiary consumers. The 10% law (Lindeman's rule) states that only about 10% of energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next. Ecological pyramids may be of numbers, biomass, or energy; the pyramid of energy is always upright.\n\nDecomposition is the breakdown of dead organic matter (detritus) by decomposers into simpler inorganic substances. The process involves fragmentation, leaching, catabolism, humification, and mineralisation. Nutrient cycling includes carbon cycle and phosphorus cycle, with gaseous and sedimentary pathways respectively. Ecological succession is the sequential, gradual change in species composition and community structure over time. Primary succession starts on bare or lifeless areas (e.g., bare rock, lava), while secondary succession occurs in areas where a community has been disturbed but soil and seeds remain. The final stable community in succession is called the climax community. Succession on bare rock begins with pioneer species like lichens (xerosere), while in water bodies it is called hydrarch succession.",
