    "text": "Biodiversity refers to the totality of genes, species, and ecosystems of a region. It is expressed at three levels: genetic diversity (variation in genes within a species), species diversity (variety of species in a region), and ecosystem diversity (variety of habitats, communities, and ecological processes). The species-area relationship (Alexander von Humboldt) is given by the equation log S = log C + Z log A, where S is species richness, A is area, Z is the regression coefficient (slope), and C is the Y-intercept. For smaller areas, Z values range from 0.1 to 0.2, whereas for very large areas like continents, Z values lie between 0.6 and 1.2. The latitudinal gradient shows that biodiversity generally increases from the poles to the equator, with tropical regions being the richest.\n\nBiodiversity loss is a serious concern caused by habitat loss and fragmentation, overexploitation, alien species invasions, and co-extinctions. The IUCN Red List categorises species based on their conservation status. Conservation strategies include in-situ conservation (protecting species in their natural habitats) through national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, biosphere reserves, and biodiversity hotspots, and ex-situ conservation (protecting species outside their habitats) through zoos, botanical gardens, seed banks, and cryopreservation. India is one of the 12 mega-diversity countries and has several biodiversity hotspots (Western Ghats and the Eastern Himalayas). Biodiversity is important for ecological stability, provides ecosystem services, has economic value (food, medicine, industrial products), and holds ethical significance — every species has a right to exist.",
