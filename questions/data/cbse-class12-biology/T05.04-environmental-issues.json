    "text": "Environmental pollution is a major concern affecting air, water, and soil quality worldwide. Air pollution is caused by pollutants such as sulphur dioxide (SO₂), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and particulate matter from vehicular emissions, industries, and burning of fossil fuels. Electrostatic precipitators and catalytic converters are devices used to control vehicular and industrial emissions. Water pollution is assessed using Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) — the amount of dissolved oxygen consumed by microorganisms to decompose organic matter. Higher BOD indicates more polluted water. Eutrophication is the excessive enrichment of water bodies with nutrients (mainly nitrates and phosphates), leading to algal blooms, oxygen depletion, and death of aquatic organisms. Biomagnification is the progressive increase in the concentration of non-degradable pollutants (such as DDT, heavy metals) at successive trophic levels in a food chain.\n\nSolid waste management involves the 3Rs — Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. Biodegradable wastes can be composted, while non-biodegradable wastes must be properly treated. Ozone depletion in the stratosphere is caused by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and other ozone-depleting substances (ODS) that release chlorine atoms to catalytically destroy ozone molecules. The Montreal Protocol (1987) is an international agreement to phase out ODS. The greenhouse effect is the warming of Earth's surface due to trapping of long-wave radiation by greenhouse gases (CO₂, CH₄, N₂O, CFCs). Enhanced greenhouse effect causes global warming, leading to sea-level rise, extreme weather events, and shifting of ecosystems. Deforestation — the clearing of forests for agriculture, timber, and urbanisation — is a major cause of biodiversity loss, soil erosion, and climate change. The Chipko movement and Joint Forest Management (JFM) are important initiatives for forest conservation in India. Reforestation and afforestation are strategies to restore forest cover.",

The charged particles are then attracted to and collected on positively charged collecting plates, effectively removing them from the gas stream.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "It does not use a mesh filter — that would be a bag filter. It does not burn particles or dissolve them in water. The electrostatic mechanism of charging particles and collecting them on oppositely charged plates is the defining feature of this device."

      "explanation_incorrect": "DDT concentration is lowest in producers and increases up the food chain. DDT is non-biodegradable — it does not break down. DDT affects both aquatic and terrestrial organisms. The key property is that its non-degradable nature causes progressive accumulation through the food chain."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Malathion is a biodegradable pesticide and is not linked to eggshell thinning. Urea is a fertiliser, not a pesticide. Methane causes global warming, not eggshell thinning. DDT biomagnification through the food chain is the well-documented cause of eggshell thinning in birds."
