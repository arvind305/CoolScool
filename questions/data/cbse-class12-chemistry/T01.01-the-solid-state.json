    "text": "Solids are classified as amorphous and crystalline. Crystalline solids have a definite and regular arrangement of constituent particles with sharp melting points and are anisotropic. Amorphous solids lack long-range order, melt over a range of temperatures, and are isotropic. Based on the nature of intermolecular forces, crystalline solids are classified as molecular (held by van der Waals forces or hydrogen bonds), ionic (held by electrostatic forces), metallic (held by metallic bonds), and covalent or network (held by covalent bonds). A crystal lattice is a three-dimensional arrangement of points representing constituent particles. There are 14 Bravais lattices classified into 7 crystal systems. A unit cell is the smallest repeating unit of the lattice. In a simple cubic (sc) unit cell, atoms are at corners only, giving 1 atom per unit cell. In body-centred cubic (bcc), there is 1 additional atom at the body centre, giving 2 atoms per unit cell. In face-centred cubic (fcc), atoms are at corners and face centres, giving 4 atoms per unit cell. Close packing in solids can be hexagonal close-packed (hcp) or cubic close-packed (ccp/fcc), both with 74% packing efficiency. Bcc has 68% packing efficiency and simple cubic has 52.4%. In close-packed structures, there are two types of voids: tetrahedral voids (coordination number 4) and octahedral voids (coordination number 6). For N close-packed spheres, there are N octahedral and 2N tetrahedral voids. Density of a unit cell is given by d = ZM/(a³Nₐ), where Z is the number of atoms per unit cell, M is molar mass, a is edge length, and Nₐ is Avogadro's number. Point defects in crystals include Schottky defect (equal number of cation and anion vacancies, decreases density), Frenkel defect (ion displaced to interstitial site, density unchanged), and impurity defects. Electrical properties classify solids as conductors (10⁻⁷ to 10⁷ ohm⁻¹m⁻¹), semiconductors (10⁻⁶ to 10⁴ ohm⁻¹m⁻¹), and insulators (10⁻²⁰ to 10⁻¹⁰ ohm⁻¹m⁻¹). Semiconductors can be intrinsic or extrinsic (n-type by doping with group 15 elements, p-type by doping with group 13 elements). Magnetic properties classify substances as paramagnetic, diamagnetic, ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and ferrimagnetic.",
