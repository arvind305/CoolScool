    "text": "A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. The component present in the largest quantity is called the solvent, and the other components are solutes. Solutions can be gaseous, liquid, or solid. Concentration can be expressed as mass percentage (w/w%), volume percentage (v/v%), mass by volume percentage (w/v%), parts per million (ppm), mole fraction (x), molarity (M = moles of solute / volume of solution in litres), and molality (m = moles of solute / mass of solvent in kg). Molality is independent of temperature while molarity changes with temperature. Henry's law states that the partial pressure of a gas in vapour phase is proportional to the mole fraction of the gas in the solution: p = Kₕx, where Kₕ is Henry's law constant. Raoult's law states that for a solution of volatile liquids, the partial vapour pressure of each component is directly proportional to its mole fraction: p₁ = p₁⁰x₁ and p₂ = p₂⁰x₂. The total pressure P = p₁⁰x₁ + p₂⁰x₂. An ideal solution obeys Raoult's law over the entire range of concentration, with ΔH_mix = 0 and ΔV_mix = 0. Examples include n-hexane and n-heptane, benzene and toluene. Non-ideal solutions show positive deviation (vapour pressure higher than Raoult's law, e.g., ethanol-acetone) or negative deviation (vapour pressure lower, e.g., chloroform-acetone). Positive deviation occurs when A-B interactions are weaker than A-A and B-B interactions. Negative deviation occurs when A-B interactions are stronger. Colligative properties depend on the number of solute particles, not their nature. These include: relative lowering of vapour pressure (Δp/p⁰ = x₂), elevation of boiling point (ΔTb = Kb × m), depression of freezing point (ΔTf = Kf × m), and osmotic pressure (π = CRT, where C is molarity). Van't Hoff factor i = observed colligative property / calculated colligative property. For dissociation, i > 1; for association, i < 1. The modified colligative property formulas include i: ΔTb = iKbm, ΔTf = iKfm, π = iCRT. Abnormal molar masses are observed when solutes associate (apparent molar mass > normal) or dissociate (apparent molar mass < normal) in solution.",
