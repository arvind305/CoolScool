    "text": "Electrochemistry deals with the interconversion of chemical energy and electrical energy. An electrochemical cell (galvanic or voltaic cell) converts chemical energy into electrical energy through spontaneous redox reactions. It consists of two half-cells connected by a salt bridge. Oxidation occurs at the anode (negative terminal) and reduction at the cathode (positive terminal). The EMF of the cell E°_cell = E°_cathode − E°_anode. The standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) has E° = 0.00 V by convention. The Nernst equation relates EMF to concentration: E_cell = E°_cell − (RT/nF)ln Q = E°_cell − (0.0591/n)log Q at 298 K, where n is the number of electrons transferred, F = 96485 C/mol, and Q is the reaction quotient. At equilibrium, E_cell = 0 and E°_cell = (0.0591/n)log K. The Gibbs energy change is related to EMF by ΔG° = −nFE°_cell. Conductance (G) = 1/R, measured in siemens (S). Specific conductance or conductivity (κ) = G × l/A = 1/(ρ), measured in S/cm or S/m. Molar conductivity Λ_m = κ × 1000/c (when κ in S/cm and c in mol/L), measured in S cm² mol⁻¹. For strong electrolytes, Λ_m increases slowly with dilution (Debye-Huckel-Onsager equation: Λ_m = Λ°_m − A√c). For weak electrolytes, Λ_m increases steeply at very low concentrations. Kohlrausch's law states that the limiting molar conductivity of an electrolyte equals the sum of the individual contributions of its ions: Λ°_m = ν₊λ°₊ + ν₋λ°₋. This law is used to calculate Λ°_m of weak electrolytes. Electrolysis is the decomposition of an electrolyte by passing direct current. Faraday's first law: mass deposited m = ZIt = (M × I × t)/(n × F), where Z is the electrochemical equivalent. Faraday's second law: when the same quantity of electricity passes through different electrolytes, the masses deposited are proportional to their equivalent weights. Batteries include primary cells (non-rechargeable, e.g., dry cell, mercury cell) and secondary cells (rechargeable, e.g., lead-acid, nickel-cadmium). Fuel cells (like hydrogen-oxygen cell) convert fuel energy directly to electrical energy. Corrosion is the electrochemical deterioration of metals, involving anodic (oxidation of metal) and cathodic (reduction of O₂) reactions. Rusting of iron requires both oxygen and water.",
