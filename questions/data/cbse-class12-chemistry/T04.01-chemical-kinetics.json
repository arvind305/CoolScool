    "text": "Chemical kinetics deals with the rates of chemical reactions and the factors that affect them. The rate of a reaction is the change in concentration of reactant or product per unit time. For a reaction aA + bB → cC + dD, the rate = −(1/a)d[A]/dt = −(1/b)d[B]/dt = (1/c)d[C]/dt = (1/d)d[D]/dt. The rate law expresses the rate as a function of concentrations: Rate = k[A]^x[B]^y, where k is the rate constant and x, y are the orders with respect to A and B. The overall order = x + y. The order is determined experimentally and may or may not equal stoichiometric coefficients. For a zero-order reaction: [A] = [A]₀ − kt, t₁/₂ = [A]₀/(2k), units of k are mol L⁻¹ s⁻¹. For a first-order reaction: ln[A] = ln[A]₀ − kt or k = (2.303/t)log([A]₀/[A]), t₁/₂ = 0.693/k (independent of initial concentration), units of k are s⁻¹. For a second-order reaction: 1/[A] = 1/[A]₀ + kt, t₁/₂ = 1/(k[A]₀). The Arrhenius equation relates the rate constant to temperature: k = Ae^(−Ea/RT), where A is the pre-exponential factor (frequency factor), Ea is the activation energy, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature. Taking logarithm: ln k = ln A − Ea/RT. For two temperatures: log(k₂/k₁) = (Ea/2.303R)(1/T₁ − 1/T₂). A catalyst lowers the activation energy, providing an alternative pathway. Molecularity is the number of reacting species that collide simultaneously in an elementary reaction. It is always a whole number (1 = unimolecular, 2 = bimolecular, 3 = termolecular). Molecularity is a theoretical concept for elementary reactions, while order is experimental and applies to the overall reaction. Collision theory states that for a reaction to occur, molecules must collide with sufficient energy (≥ Ea) and proper orientation. The rate constant k = PZe^(−Ea/RT), where P is the steric factor and Z is the collision frequency.",
