    "text": "Surface chemistry deals with phenomena occurring at surfaces or interfaces. Adsorption is the accumulation of molecular species at the surface rather than in the bulk. The substance adsorbed is the adsorbate and the material on whose surface adsorption occurs is the adsorbent. Physisorption involves weak van der Waals forces, is reversible, has low enthalpy of adsorption (20-40 kJ/mol), is not specific, and forms multilayers. Chemisorption involves chemical bond formation, is irreversible, has high enthalpy (80-240 kJ/mol), is highly specific, and forms a monolayer. Adsorption isotherms describe the variation of adsorption with pressure at constant temperature. The Freundlich isotherm gives x/m = kP^(1/n) where 1/n lies between 0 and 1. The Langmuir isotherm assumes monolayer adsorption on equivalent sites. Catalysis involves substances that alter reaction rates without being consumed. Homogeneous catalysis has catalyst and reactants in the same phase; heterogeneous catalysis has them in different phases. Catalytic action involves adsorption of reactants, formation of intermediates, and desorption of products. Enzyme catalysis is highly specific, shows Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and is affected by temperature, pH, and inhibitors. Colloidal solutions have particle sizes between 1-1000 nm. Colloids are classified as lyophilic (solvent-loving, reversible) and lyophobic (solvent-hating, irreversible). Preparation methods include chemical methods (reduction, oxidation, hydrolysis), electrical disintegration (Bredig's arc method), and peptization. Properties include Tyndall effect (scattering of light), Brownian motion (random zigzag movement), electrophoresis (movement under electric field), and coagulation (settling by addition of electrolytes). Hardy-Schulze rule states that the greater the valency of the flocculating ion, the greater its coagulating power. Emulsions are colloidal systems of two immiscible liquids stabilised by emulsifiers. Oil-in-water (O/W) and water-in-oil (W/O) are the two types. Gels are semi-rigid colloidal systems. Colloids find applications in water purification, photography, medicine, and industry.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Soap does not form a true solution with grease. It does not coagulate dirt or peptize grease. The cleansing action is based on emulsification — grease is trapped inside micelles and removed."
