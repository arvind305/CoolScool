    "text": "Metallurgy is the science of extracting metals from their ores and refining them for use. Metals rarely occur in the free state in nature; they are mostly found as compounds called minerals. An ore is a mineral from which a metal can be profitably extracted. The extraction of metals involves several stages: concentration (or beneficiation) of the ore, conversion to oxide or other intermediate, reduction to the crude metal, and refining to obtain the pure metal. Concentration methods include hydraulic washing (gravity separation), magnetic separation, froth flotation (for sulphide ores using collectors like xanthates and froth stabilisers like cresol), and leaching (chemical dissolution, e.g., cyanide leaching of gold, Bayer's process for alumina). The thermodynamic basis of extraction relies on the Ellingham diagram, which plots ΔG° of oxide formation versus temperature. A metal whose oxide has a more negative ΔG° can reduce the oxide of a metal with a less negative ΔG°. Carbon and CO lines slope downward, making carbon an effective reductant at high temperatures. Electrochemical methods are used when chemical reduction is impractical — the Hall-Héroult process electrolyses alumina dissolved in molten cryolite (Na₃AlF₆) at ~960°C to produce aluminium. Refining methods include distillation (for volatile metals like Zn), liquation (for low-melting metals like Sn), electrolytic refining (impure metal anode, pure metal cathode in an electrolyte of the metal's salt), zone refining (based on difference in solubility of impurities in solid and molten metal — used for semiconductor-grade Ge and Si), vapour phase refining (Mond process for Ni using CO; van Arkel method for Zr/Ti using I₂), and chromatography.",

The reason is also true: while iron can form Fe(CO)₅, it requires much more extreme conditions (higher temperature and pressure) than the mild conditions (330 K, 1 atm) used in the Mond process for nickel. Under Mond process conditions, iron does not form a volatile carbonyl readily, making the process unsuitable for iron refining. R correctly explains A.",
