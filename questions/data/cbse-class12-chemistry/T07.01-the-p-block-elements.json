    "text": "The p-block elements span Groups 13 to 18 of the periodic table. In CBSE Class 12, the focus is on Groups 15 (nitrogen family), 16 (oxygen family), 17 (halogens), and 18 (noble gases). Group 15 elements (N, P, As, Sb, Bi) have the general electronic configuration ns²np³. Nitrogen is unique due to its small size, high electronegativity, and ability to form pπ–pπ multiple bonds. NH₃ is a Lewis base and a ligand. Nitrogen forms oxides from N₂O to N₂O₅ with varying oxidation states (+1 to +5). Phosphorus exhibits allotropy (white, red, black phosphorus) and forms oxoacids such as H₃PO₃ (dibasic) and H₃PO₄ (tribasic). Group 16 elements (O, S, Se, Te, Po) have ns²np⁴ configuration. Oxygen exhibits allotropy (O₂ and O₃). Sulphur shows catenation and forms numerous allotropes; the most stable is rhombic sulphur (S₈). H₂SO₄ is manufactured by the Contact process and is a strong dibasic acid, powerful dehydrating agent, and oxidising agent. SO₂ and SO₃ are important oxides. Group 17 elements (F, Cl, Br, I, At) are the halogens with ns²np⁵ configuration. They are highly electronegative and form strong oxidising agents. Fluorine is the most electronegative element and most powerful oxidising halogen. HF exhibits hydrogen bonding, leading to a high boiling point. Interhalogen compounds (ClF₃, BrF₅, IF₇) are more reactive than halogens. Oxoacids of chlorine include HClO, HClO₂, HClO₃, and HClO₄, with increasing acid strength and decreasing oxidising power. Group 18 elements (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, Rn) are noble gases with completely filled ns²np⁶ configuration (except He: 1s²). Xenon forms compounds with fluorine (XeF₂, XeF₄, XeF₆) and oxygen (XeO₃, XeOF₂), demonstrating that noble gases are not completely inert. The structures of xenon fluorides are predicted by VSEPR theory.",
    "rules": [
      "Group 15 elements have ns²np³ configuration; nitrogen shows a maximum covalency of 4 (no d orbitals), while P, As, Sb can expand their octet.",
      "NH₃ is pyramidal (sp³ with one lone pair); it acts as a Lewis base and forms complexes with transition metals.",
      "Phosphorus acid (H₃PO₃) is dibasic despite having three H atoms because only two OH groups are present; the third H is directly bonded to P.",
      "Group 16 elements have ns²np⁴ configuration; oxygen is the second most electronegative element after fluorine.",
      "H₂SO₄ is manufactured by the Contact process: 2SO₂ + O₂ → 2SO₃ (catalyst: V₂O₅), followed by absorption in H₂SO₄ to form oleum.",
      "Ozone (O₃) is a powerful oxidising agent and has an angular structure with a bond angle of ~117°.",
      "Group 17 elements have ns²np⁵; they have the highest electron affinity among all elements (Cl has the highest EA, not F, due to small size and electron repulsion in F).",
      "Fluorine is the strongest oxidising halogen because of its low bond dissociation energy, high hydration enthalpy of F⁻, and high electronegativity.",
      "Interhalogen compounds have the general formula XYn (n = 1, 3, 5, 7); the larger halogen is the central atom.",
      "Among oxoacids of chlorine, acid strength increases as HClO < HClO₂ < HClO₃ < HClO₄ due to increasing number of oxygen atoms stabilising the conjugate base.",
      "Group 18 elements have fully filled orbitals; Xe forms fluorides (XeF₂ linear, XeF₄ square planar, XeF₆ distorted octahedral) due to availability of empty 5d orbitals.",
      "XeF₂ has 3 lone pairs on Xe (linear, sp³d), XeF₄ has 2 lone pairs (square planar, sp³d²), XeF₆ has 1 lone pair (distorted octahedral, sp³d³)."

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation_correct": "In NH₃, nitrogen has an oxidation state of −3 (since H is +1: x + 3(+1) = 0, x = −3). In NO, nitrogen has an oxidation state of +2 (x + (−2) = 0, x = +2). So nitrogen is oxidised from −3 to +2, a change of 5 units. This catalytic oxidation is the key first step of the Ostwald process for manufacturing HNO₃.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Nitrogen in NH₃ is −3, not 0 or +3. Nitrogen in NO is +2, not +4. The correct oxidation state change is from −3 to +2. This is a 5-electron oxidation per nitrogen atom."

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Forming compounds with xenon requires overcoming its high ionisation energy and promoting electrons into empty 5d orbitals. Only fluorine, being the most electronegative element, forms sufficiently strong Xe–F bonds to provide enough bond energy to compensate for this energy cost. The Xe–Cl, Xe–Br, and Xe–I bonds would be too weak (lower electronegativity, poorer overlap) to make compound formation thermodynamically favourable.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Steric factors are not the primary reason — XeF₆ already has six atoms around Xe. Mass of the halogen does not prevent bond formation. Xe and F do not have similar atomic radii. The key is the energy balance: only the very strong Xe–F bond (due to F's extreme electronegativity) provides enough energy."
