    "text": "The d-block elements (transition metals) are located in Groups 3-12 of the periodic table and have partially filled d orbitals in their ground state or in any of their common oxidation states. The first transition series (3d: Sc to Zn) is the most studied. General characteristics include variable oxidation states (due to the similar energies of ns and (n−1)d electrons), formation of coloured ions (due to d-d transitions), paramagnetic behaviour (due to unpaired d electrons), catalytic activity, ability to form complexes, and formation of interstitial compounds and alloys. Atomic radii decrease from Sc to Cr, then remain nearly constant from Cr to Cu due to the balance between increasing nuclear charge and increasing electron-electron repulsion. Ionisation enthalpies generally increase across the series but with some irregularities due to exchange energy stabilisation. The +2 oxidation state is common because the ns² electrons are lost first. The highest oxidation state increases from Sc (+3) to Mn (+7) and then decreases because the increasing nuclear charge holds the d electrons more tightly. KMnO₄ (potassium permanganate) is a powerful oxidising agent where Mn is in the +7 state. It is prepared by fusion of MnO₂ with KOH and an oxidising agent, followed by electrolytic oxidation. In acidic medium, MnO₄⁻ is reduced to Mn²⁺ (colourless); in neutral medium to MnO₂ (brown); in strongly alkaline medium to MnO₄²⁻ (green). K₂Cr₂O₇ (potassium dichromate) contains Cr in the +6 state and is prepared from chromite ore. The chromate-dichromate equilibrium depends on pH: CrO₄²⁻ (yellow, in base) ⇌ Cr₂O₇²⁻ (orange, in acid). K₂Cr₂O₇ is used in volumetric analysis as a primary standard. The f-block elements include the lanthanoids (4f, Ce to Lu) and actinoids (5f, Th to Lr). Lanthanoids predominantly show the +3 oxidation state, exhibit lanthanoid contraction (gradual decrease in ionic radii from La³⁺ to Lu³⁺ due to poor shielding by 4f electrons), and are paramagnetic except La³⁺ and Lu³⁺. Actinoids show a wider range of oxidation states than lanthanoids and are radioactive. The 5f orbitals extend further from the nucleus than 4f, leading to greater participation in bonding.",
    "rules": [
      "Transition metals have partially filled d orbitals in their ground state or in any common oxidation state. Zn is not a true transition metal (3d¹⁰ in ground state and +2 state).",
      "Variable oxidation states arise because ns and (n−1)d electrons have similar energies and can both be involved in bonding.",
      "Coloured ions result from d-d transitions: an electron absorbs visible light and jumps from a lower d orbital to a higher d orbital in a crystal field.",
      "Paramagnetism in transition metals is due to unpaired d electrons; the magnetic moment is approximated by μ = √(n(n+2)) BM.",
      "KMnO₄ in acidic medium: MnO₄⁻ + 8H⁺ + 5e⁻ → Mn²⁺ + 4H₂O (equivalent weight = M/5).",
      "K₂Cr₂O₇ in acidic medium: Cr₂O₇²⁻ + 14H⁺ + 6e⁻ → 2Cr³⁺ + 7H₂O (equivalent weight = M/6).",
      "Chromate-dichromate equilibrium: 2CrO₄²⁻ + 2H⁺ ⇌ Cr₂O₇²⁻ + H₂O. Yellow CrO₄²⁻ in base; orange Cr₂O₇²⁻ in acid.",
      "Lanthanoid contraction: gradual decrease in atomic and ionic radii from La to Lu due to poor shielding by 4f electrons.",
      "Lanthanoid contraction explains why second and third transition series elements (4d and 5d) in the same group have nearly identical radii.",
      "Actinoids show more variable oxidation states than lanthanoids because 5f, 6d, and 7s electron energies are closer together."

The solution is warmed to ~60°C to start the reaction. Once some Mn²⁺ is produced, it catalyses the remaining reaction, which then proceeds rapidly without further heating.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The reaction is exothermic, not endothermic. Oxalic acid does not decompose; it is oxidised. KMnO₄ is soluble at room temperature. The initial slowness is due to the absence of the autocatalyst Mn²⁺."
