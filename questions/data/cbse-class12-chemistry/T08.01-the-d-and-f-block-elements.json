    "text": "The d-block elements (transition metals) are located in Groups 3-12 of the periodic table and have partially filled d orbitals in their ground state or in any of their common oxidation states. The first transition series (3d: Sc to Zn) is the most studied. General characteristics include variable oxidation states (due to the similar energies of ns and (n−1)d electrons), formation of coloured ions (due to d-d transitions), paramagnetic behaviour (due to unpaired d electrons), catalytic activity, ability to form complexes, and formation of interstitial compounds and alloys. Atomic radii decrease from Sc to Cr, then remain nearly constant from Cr to Cu due to the balance between increasing nuclear charge and increasing electron-electron repulsion. Ionisation enthalpies generally increase across the series but with some irregularities due to exchange energy stabilisation. The +2 oxidation state is common because the ns² electrons are lost first. The highest oxidation state increases from Sc (+3) to Mn (+7) and then decreases because the increasing nuclear charge holds the d electrons more tightly. KMnO₄ (potassium permanganate) is a powerful oxidising agent where Mn is in the +7 state. It is prepared by fusion of MnO₂ with KOH and an oxidising agent, followed by electrolytic oxidation. In acidic medium, MnO₄⁻ is reduced to Mn²⁺ (colourless); in neutral medium to MnO₂ (brown); in strongly alkaline medium to MnO₄²⁻ (green). K₂Cr₂O₇ (potassium dichromate) contains Cr in the +6 state and is prepared from chromite ore. The chromate-dichromate equilibrium depends on pH: CrO₄²⁻ (yellow, in base) ⇌ Cr₂O₇²⁻ (orange, in acid). K₂Cr₂O₇ is used in volumetric analysis as a primary standard. The f-block elements include the lanthanoids (4f, Ce to Lu) and actinoids (5f, Th to Lr). Lanthanoids predominantly show the +3 oxidation state, exhibit lanthanoid contraction (gradual decrease in ionic radii from La³⁺ to Lu³⁺ due to poor shielding by 4f electrons), and are paramagnetic except La³⁺ and Lu³⁺. Actinoids show a wider range of oxidation states than lanthanoids and are radioactive. The 5f orbitals extend further from the nucleus than 4f, leading to greater participation in bonding.",
    "rules": [
      "Transition metals have partially filled d orbitals in their ground state or in any common oxidation state. Zn is not a true transition metal (3d¹⁰ in ground state and +2 state).",
      "Variable oxidation states arise because ns and (n−1)d electrons have similar energies and can both be involved in bonding.",
      "Coloured ions result from d-d transitions: an electron absorbs visible light and jumps from a lower d orbital to a higher d orbital in a crystal field.",
      "Paramagnetism in transition metals is due to unpaired d electrons; the magnetic moment is approximated by μ = √(n(n+2)) BM.",
      "KMnO₄ in acidic medium: MnO₄⁻ + 8H⁺ + 5e⁻ → Mn²⁺ + 4H₂O (equivalent weight = M/5).",
      "K₂Cr₂O₇ in acidic medium: Cr₂O₇²⁻ + 14H⁺ + 6e⁻ → 2Cr³⁺ + 7H₂O (equivalent weight = M/6).",
      "Chromate-dichromate equilibrium: 2CrO₄²⁻ + 2H⁺ ⇌ Cr₂O₇²⁻ + H₂O. Yellow CrO₄²⁻ in base; orange Cr₂O₇²⁻ in acid.",
      "Lanthanoid contraction: gradual decrease in atomic and ionic radii from La to Lu due to poor shielding by 4f electrons.",
      "Lanthanoid contraction explains why second and third transition series elements (4d and 5d) in the same group have nearly identical radii.",
      "Actinoids show more variable oxidation states than lanthanoids because 5f, 6d, and 7s electron energies are closer together."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "The 4f orbitals have a complex, diffuse shape with poor radial penetration — they do not extend as effectively toward the nucleus as s, p, or even d orbitals. As a result, 4f electrons are very poor at shielding the outer 5s, 5p, 5d, and 6s electrons from the increasing nuclear charge. In contrast, 3d orbitals have better penetration and provide more effective (though still imperfect) shielding. The cumulative poor shielding by all 14 4f electrons causes the characteristic lanthanoid contraction.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The 3d electrons do cause some contraction in the first transition series, but the effect is less dramatic. 4f orbitals actually have more angular nodes than 3d orbitals (l = 3 vs l = 2). 4f electrons are in an inner shell (not the outermost), which is precisely why their shielding ability matters for the outer electrons."

      ],
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation_correct": "Exchange energy is a quantum mechanical stabilisation that arises when electrons with the same spin occupy different orbitals of the same subshell. It is maximised when all orbitals are either singly occupied (half-filled, as in 3d⁵) or doubly occupied (fully filled, as in 3d¹⁰). In Cr, 3d⁵ 4s¹ has 10 exchange pairs among the five parallel-spin d electrons, more than 3d⁴ 4s² would have. This extra exchange energy more than compensates for the energy cost of moving an electron from 4s to 3d.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Cr and Cu are not the only elements with d orbitals — all transition metals have them. The 4s orbital does exist in Cr and Cu; it simply holds only one electron. Exchange energy operates in all atoms regardless of even or odd atomic number — it depends on parallel-spin electrons in degenerate orbitals."
