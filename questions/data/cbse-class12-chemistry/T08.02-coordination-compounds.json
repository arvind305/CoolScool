    "text": "Coordination compounds (also called complexes) consist of a central metal atom or ion surrounded by molecules or ions called ligands, which are bonded to the metal through coordinate (dative) bonds. Alfred Werner (1893) proposed that metals have two types of valency: primary (ionisable, satisfied by anions, corresponds to oxidation state) and secondary (non-ionisable, satisfied by ligands in a fixed spatial arrangement, corresponds to coordination number). A ligand is a Lewis base that donates at least one lone pair of electrons to the central metal. Ligands can be monodentate (one donor atom, e.g., NH₃, Cl⁻, H₂O), bidentate (two donor atoms, e.g., ethylenediamine (en), oxalate (C₂O₄²⁻)), or polydentate (multiple donor atoms, e.g., EDTA with 6 donor atoms). Ambidentate ligands can bond through either of two donor atoms (e.g., NO₂⁻ through N or O, SCN⁻ through S or N). IUPAC nomenclature follows specific rules: name ligands first (anionic with -o suffix, neutral by their names except aqua for H₂O, ammine for NH₃), then the metal with its oxidation state in Roman numerals. Isomerism in coordination compounds includes structural isomerism (ionisation, linkage, coordination, solvate/hydrate) and stereoisomerism (geometrical/cis-trans and optical). Geometrical isomerism occurs in square planar (cis/trans for [MA₂B₂]) and octahedral complexes. Optical isomerism occurs when the complex is non-superimposable on its mirror image (e.g., [Co(en)₃]³⁺). Valence Bond Theory (VBT) explains bonding using hybridisation of metal orbitals: sp³ (tetrahedral), dsp² (square planar), sp³d² or d²sp³ (octahedral). Inner orbital complexes use (n−1)d orbitals (d²sp³) and are typically low-spin and diamagnetic; outer orbital complexes use nd orbitals (sp³d²) and are typically high-spin and paramagnetic. Crystal Field Theory (CFT) considers ligand-metal interaction as purely electrostatic. In an octahedral field, d orbitals split into t₂g (lower energy: dxy, dyz, dxz) and eg (higher energy: dx²−y², dz²) with energy gap Δo (crystal field splitting energy). In a tetrahedral field, the splitting is reversed and Δt ≈ 4/9 Δo. Strong-field ligands (high Δo) cause pairing (low-spin), while weak-field ligands (low Δo) give high-spin complexes. The spectrochemical series orders ligands by field strength: I⁻ < Br⁻ < Cl⁻ < F⁻ < OH⁻ < C₂O₄²⁻ < H₂O < NH₃ < en < NO₂⁻ < CN⁻ < CO. Crystal Field Stabilisation Energy (CFSE) determines stability and colour. Coordination compounds find applications in medicine (cisplatin as anticancer drug), biological systems (haemoglobin, chlorophyll, vitamin B₁₂), industry (hardness of water estimation with EDTA), and photography (AgBr dissolving in Na₂S₂O₃).",
