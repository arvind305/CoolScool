  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Haloalkanes (alkyl halides) and haloarenes (aryl halides) are organic compounds in which one or more hydrogen atoms of a hydrocarbon are replaced by halogen atoms. Haloalkanes are classified as primary (1°), secondary (2°), or tertiary (3°) based on the carbon bearing the halogen. They can also be classified as vinyl (C=C–X), allyl (C=C–C–X), and benzyl (Ph–CH₂–X) halides. IUPAC nomenclature names them as haloalkanes (e.g., CH₃CH₂Cl = chloroethane) or as substituted alkanes. Haloalkanes are prepared by (i) addition of HX to alkenes (Markovnikov's rule), (ii) halogenation of alkanes (free radical substitution), (iii) from alcohols using HX, PX₃, PX₅, or SOCl₂ (thionyl chloride — best method as by-products are gaseous). The C–X bond is polar with a partial positive charge on carbon, making haloalkanes susceptible to nucleophilic substitution. SN2 (substitution, nucleophilic, bimolecular) involves backside attack by the nucleophile on the carbon bearing the halogen in a single concerted step. The rate depends on both substrate and nucleophile concentrations (rate = k[RX][Nu]). It proceeds with inversion of configuration (Walden inversion) and is favoured by primary substrates and strong nucleophiles. SN1 (substitution, nucleophilic, unimolecular) is a two-step mechanism: first, the slow ionisation of the C–X bond to form a planar carbocation, then the fast attack of the nucleophile. The rate depends only on the substrate concentration (rate = k[RX]). It proceeds with racemisation (due to planar carbocation) and is favoured by tertiary substrates and polar protic solvents. Elimination reactions (E1 and E2) compete with substitution. In E2, a strong base abstracts a β-hydrogen and the halide leaves simultaneously (anti-periplanar geometry). Zaitsev's rule states that the more substituted alkene is the major product. Haloarenes (aryl halides like chlorobenzene) are less reactive towards nucleophilic substitution than haloalkanes due to (i) resonance stabilisation of the C–X bond (partial double bond character), (ii) sp² hybridisation of the carbon (shorter, stronger bond), and (iii) the phenyl cation is highly unstable. However, haloarenes undergo electrophilic aromatic substitution (halogen is ortho/para directing but deactivating). The Fittig reaction couples aryl halides with Na to give biaryl products. Wurtz-Fittig reaction couples an aryl halide with an alkyl halide using Na. Polyhalogen compounds include CHCl₃ (chloroform), CCl₄ (carbon tetrachloride), CHI₃ (iodoform), and freons (CCl₂F₂ — refrigerants that deplete the ozone layer). DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane) is a persistent insecticide.",
