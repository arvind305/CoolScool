    "text": "Alcohols, phenols and ethers are important classes of organic compounds containing oxygen. Alcohols (R-OH) have a hydroxyl group bonded to a saturated carbon atom and are classified as primary (1 degree), secondary (2 degree), or tertiary (3 degree) based on the carbon bearing the -OH group. Phenols (Ar-OH) have a hydroxyl group directly attached to an aromatic ring. Ethers (R-O-R') have an oxygen atom bonded to two alkyl or aryl groups. IUPAC nomenclature of alcohols uses the suffix '-ol' with a locant for the -OH position; phenols are named as substituted phenols; ethers are named as alkoxyalkanes. Alcohols are prepared by hydration of alkenes (acid-catalysed, Markovnikov addition), hydroboration-oxidation of alkenes (anti-Markovnikov addition), reduction of carbonyl compounds (NaBH4 or LiAlH4), and Grignard reagent reactions with carbonyl compounds. Physical properties: alcohols and phenols have higher boiling points than hydrocarbons and ethers of comparable molecular mass due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding; solubility in water decreases with increasing hydrocarbon chain length. Reactions of alcohols include dehydration (elimination of water to form alkenes using acid catalyst at high temperature; ease of dehydration: tertiary > secondary > primary, following Zaitsev's rule), oxidation (primary alcohols give aldehydes then carboxylic acids; secondary alcohols give ketones; tertiary alcohols resist oxidation under normal conditions; PCC selectively oxidises primary alcohols to aldehydes), and esterification (reaction with carboxylic acids in the presence of acid catalyst to form esters). Phenols are more acidic than alcohols because the phenoxide ion is stabilised by resonance with the aromatic ring. Electron-withdrawing groups on the ring increase phenol acidity while electron-donating groups decrease it. Phenol reactions include electrophilic aromatic substitution (bromination gives 2,4,6-tribromophenol with Br2/H2O; nitration; sulphonation), Kolbe's reaction (phenoxide + CO2 under pressure gives salicylic acid), Reimer-Tiemann reaction (phenol + CHCl3/NaOH gives salicylaldehyde), and Williamson synthesis to form ethers (phenoxide + alkyl halide). Ethers are prepared by Williamson synthesis (alkoxide or phenoxide + alkyl halide via SN2 mechanism; works best with primary alkyl halides; tertiary halides undergo elimination). Ethers have much lower boiling points than isomeric alcohols because they cannot form hydrogen bonds among themselves. Ether reactions include cleavage by HI (excess HI converts ethers to alkyl iodides) and electrophilic substitution in anisole (methoxy group is activating and ortho/para directing).",
