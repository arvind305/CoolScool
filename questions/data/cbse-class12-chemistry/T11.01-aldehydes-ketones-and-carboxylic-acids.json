    "text": "Aldehydes (RCHO) contain a carbonyl group bonded to at least one hydrogen atom, while ketones (RCOR') have the carbonyl group bonded to two carbon atoms. Carboxylic acids (RCOOH) contain a carboxyl group (-COOH). IUPAC nomenclature: aldehydes use suffix '-al', ketones use '-one', and carboxylic acids use '-oic acid'. Aldehydes are prepared by oxidation of primary alcohols (using PCC for selective aldehyde formation), ozonolysis of alkenes, Rosenmund reduction of acid chlorides (RCOCl + H2/Pd-BaSO4 gives RCHO), and Stephen reduction (RCN + SnCl2/HCl gives RCHO). Ketones are prepared by oxidation of secondary alcohols, Friedel-Crafts acylation of arenes, and hydration of alkynes (acid-catalysed, gives ketones by Markovnikov rule; acetylene gives acetaldehyde as exception). Physical properties: carbonyl compounds have higher boiling points than hydrocarbons but lower than alcohols of comparable mass; lower members are soluble in water due to hydrogen bonding with water. The carbonyl group undergoes nucleophilic addition reactions because the carbonyl carbon is electrophilic. Aldehydes are more reactive than ketones towards nucleophilic addition due to less steric hindrance and less electron donation by one alkyl group versus two. Key nucleophilic addition reactions include addition of HCN (gives cyanohydrins), addition of NaHSO3, addition of Grignard reagents, and addition of alcohols (gives hemiacetals/hemiketals, then acetals/ketals). Condensation reactions with ammonia derivatives (NH2-Z where Z = OH, NH2, NHC6H5, NHCONH2) give products like oximes, hydrazones, phenylhydrazones, and semicarbazones with loss of water. Aldol condensation: two molecules of aldehyde/ketone with alpha-hydrogen undergo base-catalysed condensation to give beta-hydroxy aldehyde/ketone (aldol), which can dehydrate to alpha,beta-unsaturated carbonyl compound (cross-aldol also possible). Cannizzaro reaction: aldehydes without alpha-hydrogen (like HCHO, C6H5CHO) undergo self-disproportionation in concentrated NaOH to give one molecule of alcohol and one of carboxylate salt. Oxidation reactions: aldehydes are easily oxidised to carboxylic acids by mild oxidants; Tollens' test (silver mirror with ammoniacal AgNO3) and Fehling's test (red precipitate of Cu2O with Fehling's solution) are positive for aldehydes but negative for ketones. Ketones resist mild oxidation. Reduction: NaBH4 or LiAlH4 reduce both aldehydes and ketones to alcohols; Clemmensen reduction (Zn-Hg/conc. HCl) and Wolff-Kishner reduction (NH2NH2/KOH) convert C=O to CH2. Carboxylic acids are stronger acids than alcohols and phenols because the carboxylate ion is stabilised by two equivalent resonance structures. Acidity is increased by electron-withdrawing groups and decreased by electron-donating groups. Key reactions of carboxylic acids include formation of acid derivatives (acid chlorides, esters, amides, anhydrides), decarboxylation (heating sodium salt with NaOH/CaO), reduction by LiAlH4 to primary alcohols, and Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction (alpha-halogenation using Cl2 or Br2 in presence of red P).",

      "Electron-withdrawing groups (e.g., -Cl, -NO2) increase the acidity of carboxylic acids; electron-donating groups (e.g., -CH3) decrease it.",
