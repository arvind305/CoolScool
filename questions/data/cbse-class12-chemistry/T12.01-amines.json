    "text": "Amines are derivatives of ammonia in which one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced by alkyl or aryl groups. They are classified as primary (R-NH2), secondary (R2NH), or tertiary (R3N) based on the number of hydrogen atoms replaced. A quaternary ammonium salt has four organic groups attached to nitrogen and carries a positive charge. Nomenclature follows IUPAC rules: the suffix '-amine' is added to the name of the parent alkane chain, and the position of the -NH2 group is indicated by a number. Common names use the prefix 'amino-' or name the alkyl groups followed by 'amine'. Amines are prepared by reduction of nitro compounds (using Sn/HCl or catalytic hydrogenation), ammonolysis of alkyl halides (giving a mixture of primary, secondary, tertiary amines and quaternary salts), Gabriel phthalimide synthesis (selective for primary amines), and Hoffmann bromamide degradation (converts amides to primary amines with one fewer carbon). Physical properties include higher boiling points than alkanes of comparable mass due to hydrogen bonding (primary > secondary > tertiary in boiling point), solubility in water for lower members, and a characteristic fishy smell. Basicity of amines depends on electron density on nitrogen: in the gas phase, alkyl groups increase basicity by induction (tertiary > secondary > primary), but in aqueous solution, solvation and steric effects alter the order so that secondary amines are generally the most basic among aliphatic amines. Aromatic amines like aniline are much weaker bases because the lone pair on nitrogen delocalises into the benzene ring. Important reactions include alkylation (with alkyl halides), acylation (with acid chlorides/anhydrides to form amides), carbylamine reaction (primary amines + CHCl3 + KOH give isocyanides), reaction with nitrous acid (primary aliphatic amines give alcohols + N2; primary aromatic amines at 0-5 degree C give diazonium salts), Hinsberg test distinguishing primary, secondary, and tertiary amines using benzenesulphonyl chloride, and electrophilic aromatic substitution in aniline which occurs at ortho and para positions due to the -NH2 group being activating and ortho/para directing. Diazonium salts (ArN2+ X-) are prepared by treating primary aromatic amines with NaNO2 and HCl at 0-5 degree C (diazotisation). They undergo Sandmeyer reaction (replacement of N2+ by Cl, Br, CN using Cu salts), Gattermann reaction (using Cu powder), Schiemann reaction (ArN2+BF4- gives ArF on heating), and coupling reactions with phenols and amines to form azo dyes. Diazonium salts are extremely important synthetic intermediates because they allow introduction of groups that cannot be directly substituted onto a benzene ring.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation_correct": "In aqueous solution: (CH3)2NH is the most basic (inductive + good solvation), then CH3NH2 (one alkyl group), then NH3 (no alkyl groups), and C6H5NH2 is the least basic (resonance withdraws lone pair into ring).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Aniline is always the weakest base due to resonance. Alkyl groups increase basicity via +I effect. In aqueous solution, dimethylamine is more basic than methylamine, and both are more basic than ammonia."
