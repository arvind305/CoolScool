    "text": "Biomolecules are the organic molecules that form the structural and functional basis of living organisms. Carbohydrates are polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones, or substances that give these upon hydrolysis. They are classified as monosaccharides (e.g., glucose, fructose), disaccharides (e.g., sucrose, maltose, lactose), and polysaccharides (e.g., starch, cellulose, glycogen). Glucose has the molecular formula C6H12O6 and exists predominantly in two cyclic forms: alpha-D-glucose and beta-D-glucose, which are anomers differing at C-1. Fructose is a ketohexose. Sucrose (glucose + fructose linked by alpha-1,2-glycosidic bond) is a non-reducing sugar because both anomeric carbons are involved in the bond. Maltose and lactose are reducing sugars. Starch consists of amylose (unbranched, alpha-1,4-linkages) and amylopectin (branched, with alpha-1,6-linkages at branch points). Cellulose is a linear polymer of beta-D-glucose units linked by beta-1,4-glycosidic bonds; humans cannot digest it because we lack the enzyme to cleave beta-linkages. Proteins are polymers of alpha-amino acids linked by peptide bonds (-CO-NH-). The 20 standard amino acids differ in their R (side chain) groups. Proteins have four levels of structure: primary (amino acid sequence), secondary (alpha-helix and beta-pleated sheet stabilised by hydrogen bonds), tertiary (3D folding stabilised by disulphide bonds, hydrogen bonds, ionic interactions, and hydrophobic interactions), and quaternary (arrangement of multiple polypeptide subunits). Denaturation disrupts secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures without breaking peptide bonds, caused by heat, pH change, or chemical agents. Enzymes are biological catalysts that are highly specific, operate under mild conditions, and can be inhibited by competitive or non-competitive inhibitors. They lower activation energy and follow Michaelis-Menten kinetics. Vitamins are organic compounds required in small amounts for normal metabolism and are classified as fat-soluble (A, D, E, K) and water-soluble (B-group, C). Deficiency diseases include scurvy (vitamin C), rickets (vitamin D), night blindness (vitamin A), and beri-beri (vitamin B1). Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) are polymers of nucleotides. Each nucleotide consists of a nitrogenous base (purine: adenine, guanine; pyrimidine: cytosine, thymine in DNA or uracil in RNA), a pentose sugar (deoxyribose in DNA, ribose in RNA), and a phosphate group. DNA has a double-helix structure with complementary base pairing (A-T with 2 hydrogen bonds, G-C with 3 hydrogen bonds). RNA is usually single-stranded and exists as mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.",
