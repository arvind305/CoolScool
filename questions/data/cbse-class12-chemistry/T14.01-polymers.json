    "text": "Polymers are high molecular mass macromolecules formed by the linking of a large number of small repeating units called monomers through a process called polymerisation. Classification of polymers can be based on several criteria. Based on source: natural polymers (proteins, cellulose, natural rubber, starch), semi-synthetic polymers (cellulose acetate, cellulose nitrate, vulcanised rubber), and synthetic polymers (polythene, nylon, Bakelite, PVC). Based on structure: linear polymers (HDPE, HDP, PVC) have long straight chains; branched chain polymers (LDPE, low-density polythene) have branches along the main chain; and cross-linked or network polymers (Bakelite, melamine-formaldehyde) have monomers linked together forming a three-dimensional network. Based on mode of polymerisation: addition polymers are formed by repeated addition of monomers with double bonds without loss of any molecule (e.g., polythene, polypropylene, PVC, polystyrene, Teflon, polyacrylonitrile); condensation polymers are formed by the reaction of bifunctional or polyfunctional monomers with the elimination of small molecules like water (e.g., nylon 6,6; nylon 6; polyester/Terylene/Dacron; Bakelite; melamine-formaldehyde). Based on molecular forces: elastomers have weak intermolecular forces and can be stretched (rubber, Buna-S, Buna-N, neoprene); fibres have strong intermolecular forces (hydrogen bonds) and high tensile strength (nylon, polyester, silk); thermoplastics soften on heating and can be remoulded repeatedly (polythene, PVC, polystyrene); thermosetting plastics undergo permanent change on heating due to cross-linking and cannot be remoulded (Bakelite, urea-formaldehyde resin). Addition polymerisation involves chain-growth mechanism with free radical, cationic, or anionic initiators. Free radical polymerisation of ethene uses benzoyl peroxide as initiator: initiation (generation of free radical), propagation (radical adds to monomer), and termination (two radicals combine). Important addition polymers: polythene (LDPE at 1000-2000 atm with O2 trace; HDPE using Ziegler-Natta catalyst at low pressure), polypropylene, polystyrene, PVC, Teflon (PTFE), polyacrylonitrile (orlon/acrilan). Copolymerisation forms polymers from two or more monomers: Buna-S (butadiene + styrene), Buna-N (butadiene + acrylonitrile). Condensation polymerisation (step-growth): nylon 6,6 is formed from hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid; nylon 6 from caprolactam; polyester (Terylene) from ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid; Bakelite from phenol and formaldehyde (novolac then cross-linked); melamine-formaldehyde resin from melamine and formaldehyde. Natural rubber is cis-1,4-polyisoprene. Vulcanisation (heating rubber with sulphur) introduces cross-links that improve strength, elasticity and resistance. Synthetic rubbers: neoprene (polychloroprene) and Buna rubbers. Biodegradable polymers include PHBV (poly-beta-hydroxybutyrate-co-beta-hydroxyvalerate) and nylon 2-nylon 6 (polyglycine/polyaminocaproic acid). Commercially important polymers include polycarbonates, polyurethanes, and silicone polymers.",

      "Polymers are classified by source (natural, semi-synthetic, synthetic), structure (linear, branched, cross-linked), polymerisation mode (addition, condensation), and molecular forces (elastomers, fibres, thermoplastics, thermosetting).",

      "Free radical polymerisation has three steps: initiation (radical generation), propagation (chain growth), and termination (radical combination).",
      "LDPE is formed at high pressure with trace O2; HDPE is formed at low pressure with Ziegler-Natta catalyst (TiCl4 + Al(C2H5)3).",

      "Natural rubber is cis-1,4-polyisoprene; vulcanisation with sulphur introduces cross-links improving elasticity and strength.",
