    "text": "Chemistry in everyday life covers the application of chemical knowledge to drugs, food additives, cleansing agents, and other materials used daily. Drugs are chemicals of low molecular mass that interact with biological macromolecular targets to produce a therapeutic response. They are classified based on pharmacological effect (analgesics, antiseptics, etc.), drug action (mechanism), chemical structure, or molecular targets. Drug-target interaction: drugs interact with specific biological macromolecules such as enzymes and receptors. Enzyme inhibitors can be competitive (bind to active site, compete with substrate) or non-competitive (bind to allosteric site, change enzyme shape). Receptor-drug interaction occurs when drugs bind to receptor proteins on cell surfaces, mimicking or blocking the natural chemical messenger. Agonists mimic and activate the receptor; antagonists block the receptor. Analgesics relieve pain without causing loss of consciousness: non-narcotic analgesics (aspirin, ibuprofen, paracetamol) work by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis; narcotic analgesics (morphine, codeine, heroin) act on the central nervous system and are addictive. Tranquilizers are neurologically active drugs that reduce anxiety and mental tension without inducing sleep: barbiturates (veronal, seconal, luminal), benzodiazepines (diazepam/valium, chlordiazepoxide/librium), and others like equanil. Antiseptics are applied to living tissues to prevent infection (e.g., Dettol which contains chloroxylenol, iodine tincture, boric acid, hydrogen peroxide); disinfectants are applied to non-living surfaces (e.g., phenol 1% solution, chlorine in water treatment). The same substance can be an antiseptic at low concentration and a disinfectant at high concentration (e.g., phenol: 0.2% is antiseptic, 1% is disinfectant). Antimicrobials/antibiotics kill or inhibit microorganisms: bactericidal antibiotics kill bacteria (penicillin, ofloxacin, aminoglycosides); bacteriostatic antibiotics inhibit growth (erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol). Broad-spectrum antibiotics work against a wide range of bacteria; narrow-spectrum target specific types. Antifertility drugs contain synthetic progestogens and oestrogens that prevent ovulation: examples include norethindrone, ethynylestradiol (used in birth control pills). Antacids neutralise excess stomach acid: examples include aluminium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, and sodium hydrogen carbonate. Antihistamines block histamine receptors to relieve allergy symptoms: examples include brompheniramine, terfenadine, cimetidine (anti-ulcer, H2 receptor blocker). Food chemistry: artificial sweeteners include aspartame (200 times sweeter than sucrose), saccharin (550 times sweeter), sucralose, and alitame; they provide sweetness without calories. Food preservatives prevent spoilage: sodium benzoate (most common), sodium metabisulphite (SO2 source), potassium sorbate, and salt/sugar/vinegar (traditional). Antioxidants in food prevent oxidative rancidity: BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) and BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole) are synthetic antioxidants; vitamin C and vitamin E are natural antioxidants. Soaps are sodium or potassium salts of long-chain fatty acids (e.g., sodium stearate, sodium palmitate), made by saponification (alkaline hydrolysis) of fats/oils. They work by forming micelles: the non-polar hydrocarbon tail dissolves in grease and the polar head faces water, emulsifying dirt. Soaps do not work in hard water because they form insoluble calcium and magnesium salts (scum). Synthetic detergents are sodium salts of long-chain alkyl sulphates or sulphonates (anionic detergents), quaternary ammonium salts (cationic detergents), or polyethylene glycol stearates (non-ionic detergents). They work in hard water because their calcium/magnesium salts are soluble. Biodegradable detergents have straight-chain hydrocarbon tails; non-biodegradable detergents have branched chains.",
