    "text": "Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter. There are two types of charges: positive and negative. Like charges repel and unlike charges attract. Charge is conserved (the total charge of an isolated system remains constant) and quantised (charge exists in discrete multiples of e = 1.6 x 10^-19 C). Coulomb's law states that the force between two point charges q1 and q2 separated by distance r is F = kq1q2/r^2 where k = 1/(4*pi*epsilon_0) = 9 x 10^9 N m^2 C^-2. The principle of superposition states that the force on a charge due to multiple charges is the vector sum of forces due to individual charges. The electric field E at a point is the force per unit positive test charge: E = F/q0. The field due to a point charge is E = kq/r^2 directed radially outward for positive charges. An electric dipole consists of two equal and opposite charges separated by distance 2a; its dipole moment p = q(2a) directed from negative to positive charge. The field on the axial line of a dipole is E = 2kp/r^3 and on the equatorial line is E = kp/r^3 (for r >> a). Torque on a dipole in a uniform field is tau = p x E. Gauss's theorem states that the total electric flux through a closed surface is phi = q_enclosed/epsilon_0. It is used to derive fields for symmetric charge distributions: infinite line charge (E = lambda/(2*pi*epsilon_0*r)), infinite plane sheet (E = sigma/(2*epsilon_0)), and uniformly charged spherical shell.",
