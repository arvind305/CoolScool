    "text": "Electrostatic potential at a point is defined as the work done per unit positive test charge in bringing it from infinity to that point. For a point charge q, the potential is V = kq/r and is a scalar quantity. The potential due to a dipole varies as 1/r^2 and depends on the angle from the dipole axis. Equipotential surfaces are surfaces where the potential is constant; the electric field is always perpendicular to them and no work is done in moving a charge along an equipotential surface. The potential energy of a system of charges is U = kq1q2/r for two charges, and for multiple charges, it is the sum of all pair interactions. Capacitance C = Q/V measures a conductor's ability to store charge; for a parallel plate capacitor C = epsilon_0 A/d. Capacitors combine as 1/C_eq = sum(1/Ci) in series and C_eq = sum(Ci) in parallel. Energy stored in a capacitor is U = 1/2 CV^2 = 1/2 QV = Q^2/2C. Inserting a dielectric of constant K increases capacitance to C' = KC. The Van de Graaff generator uses the principle of electrostatic induction and the property that charge resides on the outer surface of a conductor to build up very high voltages.",
