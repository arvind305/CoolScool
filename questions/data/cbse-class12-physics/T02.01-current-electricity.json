    "text": "Current electricity deals with the steady flow of electric charge through conductors. Electric current I equals the rate of flow of charge (I = dQ/dt) and relates to drift velocity by I = neAv_d. Ohm's law (V = IR) holds for ohmic conductors, where resistance R = rho*l/A depends on resistivity, length, and cross-sectional area. Resistivity is a material property that varies with temperature as rho = rho_0(1 + alpha*T). Kirchhoff's junction rule (conservation of charge) states the algebraic sum of currents at a node is zero, while the loop rule (conservation of energy) states the algebraic sum of potential changes around any closed loop is zero. The Wheatstone bridge provides a null method for precise resistance measurement with balance condition R1/R2 = R3/R4. The metre bridge is its practical form using a uniform wire. The potentiometer compares EMFs without drawing current from the source, using the principle that potential drop along a uniform current-carrying wire is proportional to length.",
