    "text": "Moving charges produce magnetic fields and experience forces in magnetic fields. The Biot-Savart law gives the magnetic field dB due to a small current element Idl at a distance r as dB = (mu_0/4*pi) (Idl x r_hat)/r^2, where mu_0 = 4*pi x 10^-7 T.m/A. Using this law, the magnetic field at the centre of a circular coil of N turns carrying current I is B = mu_0 NI/(2R). Ampere's circuital law states that the line integral of B around a closed loop equals mu_0 times the current enclosed: integral(B.dl) = mu_0 I_enclosed. This is used to find the field inside a long solenoid (B = mu_0 nI) and toroid (B = mu_0 NI/(2*pi*r)). A charge q moving with velocity v in a magnetic field B experiences the Lorentz force F = q(v x B). This force is always perpendicular to the velocity and does no work, so it only changes the direction of motion. A charged particle in a uniform magnetic field moves in a circle of radius r = mv/(qB) with period T = 2*pi*m/(qB), independent of velocity. This principle is used in the cyclotron to accelerate charged particles. A current-carrying conductor of length l in a magnetic field experiences a force F = Il x B. Two parallel conductors carrying currents in the same direction attract each other with force per unit length F/l = mu_0 I1 I2/(2*pi*d). This defines the ampere: 1 ampere is that current which, flowing in each of two infinitely long parallel wires 1 m apart, produces a force of 2 x 10^-7 N per metre of length. A current loop in a magnetic field experiences a torque tau = NIAB sin(theta) = m x B, where m = NIA is the magnetic moment. The moving coil galvanometer uses this principle, with a restoring torque from a spring giving deflection theta = NBIA/(k), where k is the torsional spring constant.",
