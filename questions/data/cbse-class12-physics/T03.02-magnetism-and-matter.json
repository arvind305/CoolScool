    "text": "A bar magnet is the simplest magnetic dipole, with a magnetic dipole moment m = M*2l, where M is the pole strength and 2l is the magnetic length. The magnetic field on the axial line of a bar magnet at distance r (r >> l) is B_axial = mu_0*2m/(4*pi*r^3) and on the equatorial line is B_equatorial = mu_0*m/(4*pi*r^3). A bar magnet behaves like a solenoid; the magnetic moment of a solenoid is m = nIA*L, where n is turns per unit length and L is the length. A freely suspended magnet aligns along Earth's magnetic field. The torque on a magnetic dipole in a field B is tau = m x B and its potential energy is U = -m.B. The oscillation time period of a bar magnet in a uniform field is T = 2*pi*sqrt(I/(mB)), where I is the moment of inertia. Earth's magnetic field at any point is described by three elements: declination (angle between geographic and magnetic meridians), dip or inclination (angle between the total field and horizontal), and horizontal component B_H = B cos(delta), where delta is the dip angle. The vertical component is B_V = B sin(delta), and B = sqrt(B_H^2 + B_V^2). tan(delta) = B_V/B_H. Magnetic materials are classified as diamagnetic (mu_r slightly less than 1, negative susceptibility, repelled by magnets, e.g., bismuth, copper, water), paramagnetic (mu_r slightly greater than 1, small positive susceptibility, weakly attracted, e.g., aluminium, platinum, oxygen), and ferromagnetic (mu_r >> 1, large positive susceptibility, strongly attracted, e.g., iron, cobalt, nickel). Ferromagnetic materials show hysteresis: the B-H curve forms a loop. Retentivity is the residual magnetic field when H is reduced to zero, and coercivity is the reverse field needed to demagnetise the material. Soft ferromagnetic materials (low retentivity, low coercivity) are used in electromagnets and transformers, while hard ferromagnetic materials (high retentivity, high coercivity) are used for permanent magnets.",

      "explanation_correct": "By Curie's law for paramagnetic materials, chi is proportional to 1/T. So chi_1*T_1 = chi_2*T_2. Therefore chi_2 = chi_1 x T_1/T_2 = 2 x 10^-5 x 300/600 = 1 x 10^-5. Doubling the temperature halves the susceptibility.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Curie's law states chi = C/T for paramagnetic materials. When temperature doubles from 300 K to 600 K, the susceptibility halves: chi_2 = chi_1/2 = 1 x 10^-5. The susceptibility decreases because thermal agitation disrupts the alignment of atomic magnetic moments."
