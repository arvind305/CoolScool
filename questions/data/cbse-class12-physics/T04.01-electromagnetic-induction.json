    "text": "Electromagnetic induction is the phenomenon in which an EMF is induced in a circuit whenever the magnetic flux linked with it changes. The magnetic flux through a surface of area A in a uniform magnetic field B is Φ = B·A·cos θ. Faraday's first law states that a change in magnetic flux linked with a circuit induces an EMF, and Faraday's second law gives its magnitude: ε = −N dΦ/dt. Lenz's law determines the direction of the induced current — it always opposes the change in flux that produced it, consistent with conservation of energy. A straight conductor of length l moving with velocity v perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field B develops a motional EMF ε = Blv. Eddy currents are loops of induced current that circulate in bulk conductors exposed to changing magnetic flux. Self-inductance L of a coil is defined as L = NΦ/I and the self-induced EMF is ε = −L dI/dt. The energy stored in an inductor carrying current I is E = ½LI². Mutual inductance M between two coils quantifies the flux linkage of one coil due to current in another. An AC generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy, producing an EMF ε = NBAω sin ωt.",

By Lenz's law, these eddy currents create a magnetic field that opposes the motion of the magnet, producing a retarding force. This causes the magnet to fall slower than in free fall, though it does not stop completely.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The magnet does not fall faster or at the same rate because Lenz's law causes induced currents to oppose its motion. It does not stop completely because gravity continues to act; the retarding force only reduces the acceleration."

      "question_text": "If the induced current aided the change in flux instead of opposing it, energy would be created from nothing, violating conservation of energy.",
      "correct_answer": true,
      "explanation_correct": "This is true. If the induced current aided the flux change, it would increase the flux further, which would induce more current, creating a runaway process. This would generate unlimited energy from nothing, violating the conservation of energy. Lenz's law prevents this by ensuring the induced current opposes the change.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement is true. This is the fundamental reasoning behind Lenz's law — the induced current must oppose the change in flux to ensure energy is conserved. Otherwise, a self-amplifying cycle would create energy from nothing."

      "question_text": "A metallic ring falling through a region of non-uniform magnetic field will experience a retarding force due to the induced eddy currents in it.",
      "correct_answer": true,
      "explanation_correct": "This is true. When a metallic ring passes through a non-uniform magnetic field (where the flux through the ring is changing), eddy currents are induced. By Lenz's law, these induced currents create a magnetic field that opposes the cause of induction — namely the motion of the ring — producing a retarding force.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement is true. In a non-uniform field, the flux through the ring changes as it moves, inducing currents that by Lenz's law oppose the motion, creating a retarding force."

      "question_text": "The mutual inductance between two coils depends on the geometry, number of turns, and relative orientation of the coils, but is independent of the current flowing through either coil.",
      "correct_answer": true,
      "explanation_correct": "This is true. Mutual inductance M is a geometric property that depends on the shapes, sizes, number of turns, and relative positioning of the two coils, as well as the permeability of the medium between them. It does not depend on the current flowing through the coils (assuming no magnetic saturation).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement is true. While M is defined through the relationship ε = −M dI/dt, the value of M itself is determined by the geometry and arrangement of the coils, not by the current. It is a constant for a given configuration."

      "explanation_correct": "The EMF of an AC generator is ε = NBAω sin ωt, where NBAω is the peak EMF (ε₀). This arises because the flux Φ = NBA cos ωt, and ε = −dΦ/dt = NBAω sin ωt.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is NBAω sin ωt. The flux through the rotating coil is Φ = NBA cos ωt, so by Faraday's law, ε = −dΦ/dt = NBAω sin ωt. The sine function appears because differentiation of cosine gives negative sine, and the overall negative sign from Faraday's law yields a positive sine."
