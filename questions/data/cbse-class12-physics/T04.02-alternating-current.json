    "text": "An alternating current (AC) varies sinusoidally with time as I = I₀ sin ωt, where I₀ is the peak (maximum) value and ω = 2πf is the angular frequency. The root-mean-square (RMS) value of AC is I_rms = I₀/√2, and the RMS voltage is V_rms = V₀/√2. The average value of AC over a half cycle is I_avg = 2I₀/π. In a purely resistive circuit, voltage and current are in phase. In a purely inductive circuit, voltage leads the current by π/2 (90°), and the inductive reactance is X_L = ωL. In a purely capacitive circuit, current leads the voltage by π/2, and the capacitive reactance is X_C = 1/(ωC). In a series LCR circuit, the impedance is Z = √(R² + (X_L − X_C)²) and the phase angle is tan φ = (X_L − X_C)/R. Resonance occurs when X_L = X_C, i.e., at frequency f₀ = 1/(2π√(LC)), where impedance is minimum and equals R, and the current is maximum. The quality factor Q = ω₀L/R = 1/(ω₀CR) measures the sharpness of resonance. The average power dissipated in an AC circuit is P = V_rms I_rms cos φ, where cos φ is the power factor. A transformer works on the principle of mutual induction: V_s/V_p = N_s/N_p = I_p/I_s for an ideal transformer. Step-up transformers increase voltage (N_s > N_p), step-down transformers decrease voltage (N_s < N_p). Energy losses in real transformers arise from copper losses, eddy current losses, flux leakage, and hysteresis.",
