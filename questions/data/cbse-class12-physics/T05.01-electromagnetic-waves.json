    "text": "Maxwell modified Ampere's circuital law by introducing the concept of displacement current. The displacement current I_d = ε₀ dΦ_E/dt arises from a time-varying electric field, just as conduction current arises from the flow of charges. Maxwell's equations are four fundamental equations that describe all classical electromagnetic phenomena: (1) Gauss's law for electricity: ∮E·dA = Q/ε₀, (2) Gauss's law for magnetism: ∮B·dA = 0 (no magnetic monopoles), (3) Faraday's law: ∮E·dl = −dΦ_B/dt, and (4) Ampere-Maxwell law: ∮B·dl = μ₀(I_c + ε₀ dΦ_E/dt). Electromagnetic waves are self-sustaining oscillations of electric and magnetic fields that propagate through space. In an EM wave, E and B are perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propagation (transverse wave). The speed of EM waves in free space is c = 1/√(μ₀ε₀) ≈ 3 × 10⁸ m/s. The ratio E₀/B₀ = c. EM waves carry energy; the average energy density is u = ½ε₀E² + B²/(2μ₀). The electromagnetic spectrum, in order of increasing frequency, includes: radio waves, microwaves, infrared, visible light, ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays. All EM waves travel at the speed of light in vacuum but differ in wavelength and frequency.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Visible light enters the atmosphere largely unimpeded. The Earth's surface re-radiates energy as infrared. Greenhouse gases are largely transparent to visible light but absorb infrared, trapping the heat. UV is absorbed mainly by the ozone layer."
