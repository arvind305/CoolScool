    "text": "Ray optics treats light as straight-line rays and explains reflection, refraction, and image formation by mirrors and lenses. The law of reflection states that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection (∠i = ∠r), and the incident ray, reflected ray, and normal lie in the same plane. The mirror formula is 1/v + 1/u = 1/f, and magnification m = −v/u. Snell's law of refraction: n₁ sin i = n₂ sin r, where n is the refractive index of the medium. Total internal reflection (TIR) occurs when light travels from a denser to a rarer medium and the angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle θ_c, where sin θ_c = n₂/n₁ (n₁ > n₂). TIR is the basis for optical fibres and the sparkling of diamonds. A prism deviates light; the angle of deviation δ depends on the angle of incidence and the prism angle A. At minimum deviation δ_m, the refractive index is n = sin((A + δ_m)/2)/sin(A/2). Dispersion is the splitting of white light into its component colours by a prism because the refractive index varies with wavelength (n_violet > n_red). The lens maker's equation is 1/f = (n − 1)(1/R₁ − 1/R₂). The thin lens formula is 1/v − 1/u = 1/f, and magnification m = v/u. The power of a lens is P = 1/f (in dioptres, when f is in metres). For lenses in contact, P = P₁ + P₂. A simple microscope has magnification M = 1 + D/f (for image at near point). A compound microscope has M = m_o × m_e, where m_o = −L/f_o and m_e = 1 + D/f_e. An astronomical telescope in normal adjustment has magnification M = −f_o/f_e.",
