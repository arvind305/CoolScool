    "text": "Wave optics treats light as a wave and explains phenomena such as interference, diffraction, and polarisation. Huygens' principle states that every point on a wavefront acts as a source of secondary wavelets, and the new wavefront is the forward envelope of these secondary wavelets. Using this principle, Huygens explained the laws of reflection and refraction. In Young's double-slit experiment, two coherent sources produce an interference pattern of bright and dark fringes on a screen. The condition for constructive interference (bright fringe) is d sin θ = nλ, and for destructive interference (dark fringe) is d sin θ = (n + ½)λ, where d is the slit separation, θ is the angle, and n is an integer. The fringe width is β = λD/d, where D is the distance from slits to screen. Single-slit diffraction produces a central bright maximum of angular width 2λ/a, where a is the slit width. The condition for minima in single-slit diffraction is a sin θ = nλ (n = 1, 2, 3...). Polarisation demonstrates that light is a transverse wave. Unpolarised light has vibrations in all directions perpendicular to propagation; a polariser transmits vibrations in only one direction. Malus's law states that the intensity of polarised light after passing through an analyser is I = I₀ cos² θ, where θ is the angle between the polariser and analyser transmission axes. Brewster's angle θ_B is the angle of incidence at which reflected light is completely polarised: tan θ_B = n₂/n₁. At Brewster's angle, the reflected and refracted rays are perpendicular.",
