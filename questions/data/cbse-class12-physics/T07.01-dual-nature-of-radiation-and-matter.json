    "text": "The photoelectric effect is the emission of electrons from a metal surface when light of sufficiently high frequency falls on it. Key observations include: (i) emission is instantaneous, (ii) there exists a threshold frequency below which no emission occurs regardless of intensity, (iii) the maximum kinetic energy of emitted electrons depends on frequency but not on intensity, and (iv) the photoelectric current is proportional to the intensity of incident light. Einstein explained these observations by proposing that light consists of discrete quanta called photons, each carrying energy E = hf. His photoelectric equation is: K_max = hf - phi, where phi = hf_0 is the work function and f_0 is the threshold frequency. The stopping potential V_0 satisfies eV_0 = K_max. A photon of frequency f has energy E = hf, momentum p = hf/c = h/lambda, and zero rest mass. De Broglie proposed that matter also exhibits wave-like behaviour with wavelength lambda = h/p = h/(mv). For an electron accelerated through potential V, lambda = h/sqrt(2meV) = 1.227/sqrt(V) nm. The Davisson-Germer experiment confirmed the wave nature of electrons by observing diffraction of electrons from a nickel crystal.",
