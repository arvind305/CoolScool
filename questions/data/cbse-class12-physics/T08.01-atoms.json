    "text": "Rutherford's alpha-particle scattering experiment revealed that most alpha particles pass through a gold foil undeflected, some are scattered through small angles, and very few (about 1 in 8000) are deflected by more than 90 degrees or even bounce back. This led to the nuclear model: the atom has a tiny, dense, positively charged nucleus containing most of the mass, surrounded by electrons at relatively large distances. The impact parameter b is related to the scattering angle theta; head-on collisions (b = 0) result in 180-degree scattering. The distance of closest approach gives an estimate of nuclear size: d = 2kZe^2/(K.E.). Bohr's model postulates: (i) electrons revolve in discrete circular orbits without radiating energy, (ii) angular momentum is quantized: L = mvr = nh/(2*pi), (iii) radiation is emitted or absorbed when an electron jumps between orbits with energy hf = E_i - E_f. For hydrogen: radius r_n = n^2 a_0 (a_0 = 0.529 angstrom), velocity v_n = v_1/n, energy E_n = -13.6/n^2 eV. The hydrogen spectrum consists of several series: Lyman (n_f = 1, UV), Balmer (n_f = 2, visible), Paschen (n_f = 3, IR), Brackett (n_f = 4, IR), and Pfund (n_f = 5, IR). The wavenumber is given by 1/lambda = R(1/n_f^2 - 1/n_i^2), where R is the Rydberg constant (1.097 x 10^7 m^-1).",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "The total energy E = K.E. + P.E. The kinetic energy is positive, but the potential energy (due to Coulomb attraction) is negative and its magnitude is twice the kinetic energy (|P.E.| = 2 K.E. from the virial theorem). So the total energy is negative, meaning the electron is in a bound state — it does not have enough energy to escape to infinity.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The negative energy is not because of the electron's charge sign or direction of motion. It reflects the physics: the electron is bound. The convention of zero energy at infinity is standard (not arbitrary) — with this choice, negative total energy correctly indicates a bound state where P.E. dominates over K.E."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "Gold is extremely malleable and can be beaten into foils only a few hundred atoms thick (about 2.1 x 10^-7 m). A very thin foil was essential so that each alpha particle encounters at most a few nuclei, making the scattering results interpretable. Additionally, gold's high atomic number (Z = 79) provides a strong Coulomb field for effective scattering.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Gold is not the cheapest metal, nor does it have the highest Z (that would be heavier elements like uranium). Gold atoms are actually larger than many lighter elements. The real reasons are: (1) extreme malleability allowing ultra-thin foils for single-scattering conditions, and (2) high Z for significant Coulomb interaction."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The Rydberg constant is the same for all hydrogen series. All electromagnetic radiation travels at the same speed (c).
