    "text": "Rutherford's alpha-particle scattering experiment revealed that most alpha particles pass through a gold foil undeflected, some are scattered through small angles, and very few (about 1 in 8000) are deflected by more than 90 degrees or even bounce back. This led to the nuclear model: the atom has a tiny, dense, positively charged nucleus containing most of the mass, surrounded by electrons at relatively large distances. The impact parameter b is related to the scattering angle theta; head-on collisions (b = 0) result in 180-degree scattering. The distance of closest approach gives an estimate of nuclear size: d = 2kZe^2/(K.E.). Bohr's model postulates: (i) electrons revolve in discrete circular orbits without radiating energy, (ii) angular momentum is quantized: L = mvr = nh/(2*pi), (iii) radiation is emitted or absorbed when an electron jumps between orbits with energy hf = E_i - E_f. For hydrogen: radius r_n = n^2 a_0 (a_0 = 0.529 angstrom), velocity v_n = v_1/n, energy E_n = -13.6/n^2 eV. The hydrogen spectrum consists of several series: Lyman (n_f = 1, UV), Balmer (n_f = 2, visible), Paschen (n_f = 3, IR), Brackett (n_f = 4, IR), and Pfund (n_f = 5, IR). The wavenumber is given by 1/lambda = R(1/n_f^2 - 1/n_i^2), where R is the Rydberg constant (1.097 x 10^7 m^-1).",
