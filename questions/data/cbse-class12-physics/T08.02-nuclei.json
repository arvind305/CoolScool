    "text": "The nucleus of an atom contains protons and neutrons (collectively called nucleons). The atomic number Z gives the number of protons, the mass number A gives the total number of nucleons, and N = A - Z is the number of neutrons. Isotopes have the same Z but different A; isobars have the same A but different Z; isotones have the same N. The nuclear radius follows R = R_0 A^(1/3), where R_0 = 1.2 fm. Since volume is proportional to A and mass is approximately A u, the nuclear density is nearly constant (about 2.3 x 10^17 kg/m^3) for all nuclei. The mass of a nucleus is less than the sum of the masses of its constituent nucleons; this difference is the mass defect: Delta_m = [Z m_p + (A-Z) m_n] - M_nucleus. By Einstein's mass-energy relation E = mc^2, this mass defect corresponds to the binding energy: B.E. = Delta_m x c^2 = Delta_m x 931.5 MeV. The binding energy per nucleon (B.E./A) peaks around A = 56 (iron), indicating maximum stability. Nuclei with very high or very low A have lower B.E./A and can release energy via fission or fusion respectively. Radioactivity is the spontaneous emission of alpha, beta, or gamma radiation. The decay law is N = N_0 e^(-lambda t), where lambda is the decay constant. Half-life T_(1/2) = 0.693/lambda. Mean life tau = 1/lambda = T_(1/2)/0.693. In alpha decay, the mass number decreases by 4 and atomic number by 2. In beta-minus decay, a neutron converts to a proton (Z increases by 1, A unchanged). Nuclear fission is the splitting of a heavy nucleus (e.g., U-235) into two lighter fragments with release of energy. Nuclear fusion is the combining of light nuclei (e.g., hydrogen isotopes) to form a heavier nucleus with release of energy, as in stars.",
