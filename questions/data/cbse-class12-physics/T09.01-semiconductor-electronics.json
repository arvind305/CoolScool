    "text": "Solids are classified into conductors, semiconductors, and insulators based on their energy band structure. In conductors, the valence band and conduction band overlap or are very close; in insulators, the band gap is large (> 3 eV); in semiconductors, the band gap is small (about 0.7 eV for Ge, 1.1 eV for Si). In intrinsic (pure) semiconductors, electron-hole pairs are created thermally; n_e = n_h = n_i. Extrinsic semiconductors are doped with impurities: n-type (pentavalent dopants like P, As, Sb donate electrons, making electrons the majority carriers) and p-type (trivalent dopants like B, Al, In accept electrons, making holes the majority carriers). A p-n junction forms a depletion region with a built-in potential barrier. In forward bias (p connected to positive terminal), the barrier reduces and current flows easily; in reverse bias, the barrier increases and only a small reverse saturation current flows. The V-I characteristic shows a threshold voltage (~0.3 V for Ge, ~0.7 V for Si) in forward bias. A half-wave rectifier uses one diode to convert AC to pulsating DC; a full-wave rectifier uses two diodes with a centre-tapped transformer. Special diodes include: Zener diode (operates in reverse breakdown for voltage regulation), LED (emits light when forward biased), and photodiode (generates current when light falls on it in reverse bias). A transistor (npn or pnp) has three regions: emitter, base, and collector. In common-emitter configuration, current gain beta = I_C/I_B (typically 20-500), and voltage gain A_v = beta x R_C/R_B. Logic gates perform Boolean operations: OR (A+B), AND (A.B), NOT (complement of A), NAND (complement of A.B), and NOR (complement of A+B). NAND and NOR are universal gates.",
