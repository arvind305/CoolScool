    "text": "Plants are living things that grow all around us. There are different types of plants: trees are big and tall with thick trunks, shrubs are smaller with many branches, herbs are small soft plants, and climbers grow by climbing on walls or sticks. Every plant has parts: roots hold the plant in the soil and drink water, the stem carries water to all parts, leaves make food using sunlight, flowers are colourful and make seeds, fruits have seeds inside, and seeds grow into new plants. Plants need water, sunlight, air, and soil to grow. Plants are very useful to us. They give us food like fruits, vegetables, and grains. They give us shade, wood, medicine, and clean air to breathe.",
