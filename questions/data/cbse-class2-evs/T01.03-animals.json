    "text": "Animals are living things that live all around us. Some animals live with us and help us. These are called domestic animals, like cows, hens, goats, and horses. Some animals are dangerous and live in forests. These are called wild animals, like lions, tigers, elephants, and deer. Some animals are our friends and live in our homes. These are called pet animals, like dogs, cats, rabbits, and parrots. Baby animals have special names: a baby dog is a puppy, a baby cat is a kitten, a baby cow is a calf, and a baby hen is a chick. Animals live in different homes: birds live in nests, dogs live in kennels, horses live in stables, and lions live in dens. Different animals eat different food: some eat only plants (like cows and goats), some eat only meat (like lions and tigers), and some eat both plants and meat (like dogs and bears).",
