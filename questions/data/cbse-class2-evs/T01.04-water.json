    "text": "Water is very important for all living things. People, animals, and plants all need water to live. We use water every day for drinking, cooking, bathing, washing clothes, cleaning the house, and watering plants. Water comes from many places: rain gives us water, rivers and lakes have water, wells have water under the ground, and taps bring water to our homes. We must save water and not waste it. We should turn off the tap when not using it, not play with water pipes, and collect rainwater. It is very important to drink clean water. Dirty water has germs that can make us sick. We should always drink clean, boiled, or filtered water.",
