    "text": "Air is all around us. We cannot see air, but we can feel it when the wind blows. All living things need air to breathe and stay alive. People, animals, and plants all breathe air. Air is very useful to us. We use air for breathing, flying kites, drying clothes on a clothesline, running windmills, and sailing boats. Moving air is called wind. Sometimes the wind blows gently and sometimes it blows very fast. Smoke from factories and vehicles, and dust from roads make the air dirty. This is called air pollution. Dirty air is bad for our health. Trees and plants help clean the air. We should plant more trees to keep the air clean.",
