    "text": "A house is a place where we live with our family. We need a house to protect us from the sun, rain, cold, wind, insects, and wild animals. There are different types of houses. A pucca house is made of bricks, cement, and concrete and is very strong. A kutcha house is made of mud, straw, and bamboo. Flats are houses built one on top of another in big buildings. Huts are small houses made of mud and straw found in villages. Bungalows are big houses with gardens. Tents are temporary houses made of cloth. Houseboats float on water. Houses are made from many materials like bricks, cement, wood, mud, straw, bamboo, and stones. Inside a house, there are different rooms: the bedroom is for sleeping, the kitchen is for cooking, the bathroom is for bathing, the living room is for sitting with family, and the dining room is for eating food. We have furniture like beds, chairs, tables, cupboards, and sofas in our homes.",
