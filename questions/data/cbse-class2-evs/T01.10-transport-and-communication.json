    "text": "Transport means moving people and things from one place to another. There are three main types of transport: road transport (car, bus, bicycle, auto-rickshaw, truck, train), water transport (boat, ship, ferry), and air transport (aeroplane, helicopter). We must follow road safety rules like stopping at a red light, walking on the zebra crossing, and looking both ways before crossing the road. Communication means sharing messages and information. We communicate using phones, letters, emails, newspapers, radio, and television. Long ago, people used bullock carts, horse carriages, and pigeon post, but now we have faster ways to travel and communicate.",
