    "text": "Numbers from 1 to 100 can be counted, read, and written. Each number has a numeral (like 45) and a number name (like forty-five). Two-digit numbers have a tens place and a ones place. For example, in the number 73, the digit 7 is in the tens place (meaning 7 tens or 70) and the digit 3 is in the ones place (meaning 3 ones).",

      "Numbers from 1 to 9 are single-digit numbers.",
      "Numbers from 10 to 99 are two-digit numbers with a tens place and a ones place.",

      "In a two-digit number, the left digit tells the tens and the right digit tells the ones.",
      "The number just after any number is found by adding 1 to it.",
