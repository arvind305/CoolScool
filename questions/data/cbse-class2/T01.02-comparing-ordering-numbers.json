    "text": "We can compare numbers to find which is greater (bigger) and which is smaller. To compare two-digit numbers, first look at the tens digit. The number with more tens is greater. If the tens digits are the same, then look at the ones digit. We can arrange numbers in ascending order (smallest to largest) or descending order (largest to smallest).",
    "rules": [
      "The symbol > means 'greater than' (the bigger number comes first).",
      "The symbol < means 'less than' (the smaller number comes first).",
