    "text": "Word problems on subtraction describe everyday situations where we need to find how many are left, how many more, or the difference between two quantities. We look for keywords like 'left', 'remaining', 'gave away', 'less', 'difference', and 'how many more' to know that we need to subtract.",
    "rules": [
      "Keywords like 'left', 'remaining', 'gave away', 'flew away', 'ate' tell us to subtract.",
      "Keywords like 'how many more', 'how many fewer', 'difference' also mean subtraction.",
      "Read the problem carefully to find the two numbers.",
      "Subtract the smaller number from the bigger number.",
