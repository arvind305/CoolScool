    "text": "Skip counting means counting forward by a number other than 1. When we skip count by 2s, we count 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, ... (adding 2 each time). Skip counting by 5s goes 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ... and by 10s goes 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, ... Skip counting helps us count groups of objects quickly and prepares us for multiplication.",
