    "text": "Length tells us how long, short, or tall something is. We can compare the lengths of two objects to find which is longer or shorter. We can measure length using non-standard units like hand spans, footsteps, or pencil lengths. A standard unit of length is the centimetre (cm), measured using a ruler.",

      "Length tells us how long or short something is. Height tells us how tall something is.",
      "We compare lengths using the words: longer, shorter, taller, same length.",
      "Non-standard units include hand spans, footsteps, pencils, and paper clips.",
      "Different people may get different measurements with non-standard units.",
      "Standard units like centimetre (cm) give the same measurement for everyone.",

Trains are many metres long while a pencil is about 15-20 cm.","explanation_incorrect":"A train is obviously much longer than a pencil. The pencil is very short compared to a train."},
    {"question_id":"T05.01.Q002","concept_id":"T05.01.C01","difficulty":"familiarity","type":"mcq","question_text":"Which is shorter: a bus or a bicycle?","options":[{"id":"A","text":"Bus"},{"id":"B","text":"Bicycle"},{"id":"C","text":"Both are the same length"},{"id":"D","text":"Cannot tell"}],"correct_answer":"B","explanation_correct":"A bicycle is shorter than a bus. Buses are much longer vehicles.","explanation_incorrect":"A bus is a large vehicle and is much longer than a bicycle. The bicycle is the shorter one."},

Whose ribbon is longer?","options":[{"id":"A","text":"Rani's"},{"id":"B","text":"Sita's"},{"id":"C","text":"Both are the same"},{"id":"D","text":"Cannot tell"}],"correct_answer":"A","explanation_correct":"Rani's ribbon is longer because 10 hand spans > 7 hand spans.","explanation_incorrect":"10 hand spans is more than 7 hand spans, so Rani's ribbon is longer."},
    {"question_id":"T05.01.Q005","concept_id":"T05.01.C02","difficulty":"familiarity","type":"mcq","question_text":"What can be used as a non-standard unit to measure the length of a table?","options":[{"id":"A","text":"A ruler marked in cm"},{"id":"B","text":"Hand spans"},{"id":"C","text":"A weighing machine"},{"id":"D","text":"A clock"}],"correct_answer":"B","explanation_correct":"Hand spans can be used as a non-standard unit to measure the length of a table. You place your hand across the table and count the spans.","explanation_incorrect":"A weighing machine measures weight, not length. A clock measures time. Hand spans are a simple non-standard way to measure length."},
    {"question_id":"T05.01.Q006","concept_id":"T05.01.C02","difficulty":"familiarity","type":"mcq","question_text":"Priya measures her desk using paper clips. She uses 12 paper clips. What is the length of her desk?","options":[{"id":"A","text":"12 paper clips long"},{"id":"B","text":"12 cm long"},{"id":"C","text":"12 metres long"},{"id":"D","text":"12 hand spans long"}],"correct_answer":"A","explanation_correct":"Since Priya measured with paper clips, the desk is 12 paper clips long. Paper clips are non-standard units.","explanation_incorrect":"She used paper clips as the unit, so the answer is in paper clips. It is not cm or metres because those are standard units she did not use."},
    {"question_id":"T05.01.Q007","concept_id":"T05.01.C02","difficulty":"application","type":"mcq","question_text":"Two children measure the same table using hand spans. Rohit gets 8 hand spans and Neha gets 10 hand spans. Why are their answers different?","options":[{"id":"A","text":"They measured different tables"},{"id":"B","text":"Rohit has bigger hand spans than Neha"},{"id":"C","text":"Neha counted wrong"},{"id":"D","text":"The table changed size"}],"correct_answer":"B","explanation_correct":"Rohit has bigger hands than Neha, so his hand spans are longer. He needs fewer spans to cover the same length. This shows why non-standard units can give different answers.","explanation_incorrect":"If Rohit gets fewer spans, his hand spans must be bigger. This is a key problem with non-standard units — different people get different measurements."},
    {"question_id":"T05.01.Q008","concept_id":"T05.01.C03","difficulty":"familiarity","type":"mcq","question_text":"Which tool do we use to measure length in centimetres?","options":[{"id":"A","text":"A weighing scale"},{"id":"B","text":"A ruler"},{"id":"C","text":"A thermometer"},{"id":"D","text":"A clock"}],"correct_answer":"B","explanation_correct":"A ruler is used to measure length in centimetres (cm).","explanation_incorrect":"A weighing scale measures weight.

Which pencil is shorter?","options":[{"id":"A","text":"The 15 cm pencil"},{"id":"B","text":"The 12 cm pencil"},{"id":"C","text":"Both are the same"},{"id":"D","text":"Cannot tell"}],"correct_answer":"B","explanation_correct":"The 12 cm pencil is shorter because 12 < 15.","explanation_incorrect":"12 cm is less than 15 cm, so the 12 cm pencil is shorter."},
    {"question_id":"T05.01.Q010","concept_id":"T05.01.C01","difficulty":"application","type":"mcq","question_text":"Ram's height is the same as the height of a door. Shyam's height reaches only up to the door handle. Who is taller?","options":[{"id":"A","text":"Ram"},{"id":"B","text":"Shyam"},{"id":"C","text":"Both are the same height"},{"id":"D","text":"Cannot tell"}],"correct_answer":"A","explanation_correct":"Ram is taller because his height equals the door's height, while Shyam only reaches the door handle, which is lower than the top of the door.","explanation_incorrect":"The door handle is below the top of the door. Ram reaches the full height of the door, so he is taller."},
    {"question_id":"T05.01.Q011","concept_id":"T05.01.C01","difficulty":"application","type":"mcq","question_text":"A snake is 5 footsteps long. A worm is 1 footstep long.

Hand spans are a non-standard unit. Different people have different hand sizes, so measurements can vary.","explanation_incorrect":"Hand spans are non-standard because everyone's hand size is different."},

It is only a few millimetres long, much shorter than a cricket bat, ruler, or broom.","explanation_incorrect":"An ant is tiny compared to all the other objects listed. It is the shortest."},
    {"question_id":"T05.01.Q017","concept_id":"T05.01.C02","difficulty":"exam_style","type":"mcq","question_text":"Karan's table is 6 pencil-lengths long. If he uses shorter pencils, will the number be more or less?","options":[{"id":"A","text":"More, because shorter pencils cover less distance each"},{"id":"B","text":"Less, because shorter pencils are smaller"},{"id":"C","text":"Same, because the table has not changed"},{"id":"D","text":"Cannot tell"}],"correct_answer":"A","explanation_correct":"With shorter pencils, each pencil covers less length, so he will need more pencils to measure the same table. The number will be more.","explanation_incorrect":"Shorter units mean more of them are needed to cover the same length. So the number increases."},
    {"question_id":"T05.01.Q018","concept_id":"T05.01.C03","difficulty":"application","type":"mcq","question_text":"A ribbon is 20 cm long. Another ribbon is 35 cm long.

So 2 books can fit.","explanation_incorrect":"20 + 20 = 40 cm (2 books). 20 + 20 + 20 = 60 cm (3 books won't fit). So 2 books fit."},
