    "text": "2D (two-dimensional) shapes are flat shapes that have length and width but no thickness. The basic 2D shapes are circle, square, triangle, rectangle, and oval. Shapes have sides (straight edges) and corners (where two sides meet). A circle has 0 sides and 0 corners. A triangle has 3 sides and 3 corners. A square has 4 equal sides and 4 corners. A rectangle has 4 sides (opposite sides are equal) and 4 corners. An oval has 0 sides and 0 corners (like a stretched circle).",
    "rules": [
      "A circle has 0 sides and 0 corners. It is perfectly round.",
      "A triangle has 3 sides and 3 corners.",
      "A square has 4 equal sides and 4 corners.",
      "A rectangle has 4 sides and 4 corners. Opposite sides are equal.",
      "An oval is like a stretched circle with 0 sides and 0 corners.",
      "Every square is a rectangle, but not every rectangle is a square.",
