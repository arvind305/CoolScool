    "text": "3D (three-dimensional) shapes are solid shapes that have length, width, and height. They take up space. The basic 3D shapes are cube, cuboid, cylinder, sphere, and cone. A cube has 6 equal square faces, 12 edges, and 8 vertices (corners). A cuboid has 6 rectangular faces, 12 edges, and 8 vertices. A cylinder has 2 flat circular faces and 1 curved surface. A sphere is perfectly round like a ball with no flat faces. A cone has 1 flat circular face and 1 curved surface coming to a point. Some 3D shapes can roll (sphere, cylinder, cone) and some can slide (cube, cuboid).",

      "A cube has 6 square faces, 12 edges, and 8 vertices.",
