    "text": "A shape has symmetry when you can fold it along a line and both halves match exactly. This fold line is called the line of symmetry. Many shapes and objects have symmetry — a circle, a square, a rectangle, a butterfly, and a leaf are all symmetrical. Patterns are arrangements that repeat in a predictable way. In a repeating pattern, a group of items (like shapes or colours) repeats over and over (e.g., red, blue, red, blue). In a growing pattern, the numbers or items increase by the same amount each time (e.g., 2, 4, 6, 8).",
    "rules": ["A line of symmetry divides a shape into two matching halves.","If you fold a shape along the line of symmetry, both halves fit exactly on top of each other.","A circle, square, and rectangle are symmetrical shapes.","A butterfly and a leaf are examples of symmetrical objects from nature.","In a repeating pattern, the same group repeats (AB, AB, AB or ABC, ABC).","In a growing pattern, numbers increase by the same amount (e.g., +2, +3, +5, +10).","To find the next item in a pattern, look at what repeats or what changes each time."]
