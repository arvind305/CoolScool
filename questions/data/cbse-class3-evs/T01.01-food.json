    "text": "We get our food from two main sources: plants and animals. Plants give us fruits, vegetables, grains, pulses, and spices. Animals give us milk, eggs, meat, honey, and fish. Some foods like fruits and salads can be eaten raw, while others need to be cooked. Cooking makes food soft, tasty, easy to digest, and kills germs. Common cooking methods include boiling, frying, roasting, baking, and steaming. To keep food fresh for a long time, we use preservation methods like refrigeration, drying, pickling, and adding salt or sugar.",
