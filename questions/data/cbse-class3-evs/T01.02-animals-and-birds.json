    "text": "Animals and birds live in different places called habitats. A habitat gives animals food, water, and shelter. Birds have special beaks, claws, and feet that help them eat different kinds of food and move in different ways. Birds build nests to lay eggs and protect their babies. Some birds travel very long distances when seasons change. This is called migration. We should take care of animals and birds around us by giving them food and water and not hurting them.",
