    "text": "Plants grow from seeds. When a seed gets water, air, and warmth, it begins to grow. This is called germination. First a root grows downward into the soil, then a shoot grows upward towards the light. Plants are of different types: herbs are small plants with soft stems, shrubs are medium-sized with hard stems, trees are tall with thick trunks, climbers grow upward using support, and creepers spread along the ground. Plants adapt to their surroundings - desert plants like cactus have thick stems and spines, while water plants like lotus float on water. Trees and forests are very important as they give us oxygen, food, shade, wood, and medicines.",
    "rules": [
      "Germination is the process by which a seed grows into a new plant",
      "Seeds need water, air, warmth, and soil to germinate",
      "During germination, the root grows down first and the shoot grows up",
      "Herbs have small, soft stems; shrubs have medium, hard stems; trees have tall, thick trunks",
      "Climbers need support to grow upward; creepers spread along the ground",
      "Plants in different places have different adaptations to help them survive",

      "explanation_correct": "Germination is the process when a seed begins to grow into a new plant. When a seed gets water, air, and warmth, the seed coat breaks open and a small root and shoot come out.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Germination is not about losing leaves, blooming flowers, or cutting trees. It is the process when a seed starts to grow. The seed coat breaks, a root grows down into the soil, and a shoot grows up towards the sunlight."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Seeds do not need only sunlight, sand, or paint to grow. They need three main things: water (to soak and soften the seed coat), air (for oxygen), and warmth (from the sun). Without these, the seed will not germinate."
