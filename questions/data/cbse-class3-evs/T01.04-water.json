    "text": "Water is essential for all living things. It moves in a continuous cycle called the water cycle. The sun heats water in rivers, lakes, and seas, and it turns into water vapour (evaporation). This water vapour rises into the sky, cools down, and forms clouds (condensation). When the clouds become heavy, water falls back to Earth as rain, snow, or hail (precipitation). Water comes from many sources like rivers, lakes, ponds, wells, and rain. We must save water because clean water is limited. We can make water safe to drink by boiling, filtering, or using a water purifier.",
    "rules": [
      "The water cycle is the continuous movement of water from Earth to sky and back",
      "Evaporation: water changes from liquid to vapour when heated by the sun",
      "Condensation: water vapour cools and forms tiny water droplets that make clouds",
      "Precipitation: water falls from clouds as rain, snow, or hail",
      "Sources of water include rivers, lakes, ponds, wells, tube wells, and rain",
      "We should save water by turning off taps, fixing leaks, and not wasting it",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The water cycle is not a bicycle, pump, or circular river. It is the natural process where water moves from Earth's surface (rivers, lakes, seas) up to the sky as vapour, forms clouds, and comes back as rain. This goes on and on."

      "explanation_correct": "Wet clothes dry faster on a hot, windy day because both heat and wind speed up evaporation. The sun's heat turns the water in clothes into vapour, and the wind carries this vapour away quickly, making the clothes dry faster.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Clothes do not become lighter or blow away. The reason is that heat and wind help evaporation happen faster. Sun's heat gives energy for water to change into vapour, and wind blows the vapour away, allowing more water to evaporate from the clothes."
