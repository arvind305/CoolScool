    "text": "We all need a house or shelter to live in. A house protects us from heat, cold, rain, wind, wild animals, and thieves. There are different types of houses like kutcha houses (made from mud, straw, and bamboo), pucca houses (made from bricks, cement, and concrete), flats, bungalows, huts, tents, and houseboats. The type of house people build depends on the weather, available materials, and the land they live on. In different parts of India, houses look very different. People in Kashmir live in houseboats, people in Assam build bamboo houses on stilts, and people in Rajasthan build stone houses to keep cool in the desert heat.",
