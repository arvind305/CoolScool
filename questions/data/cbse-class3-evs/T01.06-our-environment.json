    "text": "Our environment is everything around us - the air, water, land, plants, animals, and all living and non-living things. We must keep our surroundings clean and healthy. Dirty surroundings attract flies, mosquitoes, and rats, which spread diseases. Waste is of two types: wet waste (like food scraps and vegetable peels, which can decompose) and dry waste (like plastic, glass, and metal, which do not decompose easily). We can help the environment by following the 3Rs: Reduce (use less), Reuse (use things again), and Recycle (make new things from old materials). We should plant trees, use dustbins, and keep our school, home, and neighbourhood clean.",
