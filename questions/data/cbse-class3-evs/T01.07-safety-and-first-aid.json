    "text": "Safety means protecting ourselves from harm and danger. Road safety rules help us stay safe when walking or travelling. We must always follow traffic signals - red means stop, yellow means wait, and green means go. We should walk on the footpath, use zebra crossings, and look both ways before crossing the road. Fire safety means being careful with fire and knowing what to do if there is a fire. We should never play with matchsticks or the gas stove. First aid is the immediate help given to a person who is hurt before a doctor arrives. For small cuts, we should wash with clean water and apply a bandage. For burns, we should hold the burn under cold running water. Personal safety means knowing about good touch and bad touch, and telling a trusted adult if someone makes us uncomfortable.",
