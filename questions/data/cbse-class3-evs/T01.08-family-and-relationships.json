    "text": "A family is a group of people who are related to each other and live together. There are two main types of families: a nuclear family has parents and their children, while a joint family has grandparents, parents, uncles, aunts, and cousins all living together. Every family member has a role — parents earn money and take care of the family, grandparents share wisdom and stories, and children help by keeping their rooms clean and studying well. Families care for each other by sharing, helping when someone is sick, and celebrating festivals together. A family tree is a chart that shows how all members of a family are related to one another.",
