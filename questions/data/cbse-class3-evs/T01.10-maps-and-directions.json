If you face North, South is behind you, East is to your right, and West is to your left. A map is a drawing that shows places from above, like a bird looking down from the sky. Maps use symbols to show things like roads, buildings, rivers, and parks. Landmarks are well-known places like schools, hospitals, temples, and post offices that help us find our way. When we read a map, we can find where things are and how to get from one place to another.",
