    "text": "A community is a group of people who live and work together in a place. People do different types of work called occupations. Farmers grow food, teachers teach in schools, doctors treat sick people, police keep us safe, and postmen deliver letters. People work to earn money, help others, and serve the community. Every type of work is important and we should respect all workers — whether they are doctors, sweepers, drivers, or guards. This is called dignity of labour. India has both villages and cities. Village life is peaceful with farming, open fields, and ponds, while city life has tall buildings, offices, more traffic, and many markets.",
