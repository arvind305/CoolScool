    "text": "Transport means moving people and things from one place to another. Long ago, people walked or used animals like horses, camels, donkeys, and elephants to travel. Bullock carts were used to carry heavy loads. The invention of the wheel was a very important event that changed transport forever. Today, we have many types of transport. Land transport includes buses, cars, trains, auto-rickshaws, bicycles, and trucks. Water transport includes boats, ships, and ferries. Air transport includes aeroplanes and helicopters. Indian Railways is one of the largest railway networks in the world and connects cities and towns all across India. Public transport like buses, trains, and metros are used by many people every day. We must follow road safety rules like using zebra crossings, wearing helmets, and fastening seatbelts.",
