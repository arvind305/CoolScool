    "text": "Communication means sharing information, ideas, and feelings with others. In the olden days, people used messengers, pigeons, drums, and smoke signals to send messages. Later, letters became a popular way to communicate — people wrote on paper, put it in an envelope, and posted it at the post office. The postman then delivered the letter. The invention of the telephone allowed people to talk to someone far away. Today, we have mobile phones that can make calls, send messages, take photos, and connect to the internet. The internet allows us to send emails, make video calls, and chat with people anywhere in the world. Mass media like newspapers, radio, and television reach many people at once with news and information. While the internet is very useful, we should use it safely and never share personal information with strangers.",
