    "text": "Three-digit numbers range from 100 to 999. Each digit has a place value: hundreds (H), tens (T), and ones (O). For example, in 456, the digit 4 is in the hundreds place (value 400), the digit 5 is in the tens place (value 50), and the digit 6 is in the ones place (value 6). Numbers can be written in standard form (456) or expanded form (400 + 50 + 6). The successor of a number is the number that comes just after it, and the predecessor is the number that comes just before it.",

      "A three-digit number has digits in hundreds, tens, and ones places",
      "Place value = Face value x Position value (e.g., in 356, place value of 3 is 300)",
