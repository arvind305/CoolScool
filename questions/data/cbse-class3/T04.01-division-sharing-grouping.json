  "topic_name": "Division as Sharing and Grouping",
  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Division means splitting a number into equal parts. Equal sharing: distributing items equally among people (e.g., 12 sweets shared among 3 children = 4 each). Equal grouping: making groups of a fixed size (e.g., 12 items in groups of 4 = 3 groups). Division can also be seen as repeated subtraction. Division is the inverse of multiplication: if 3 x 4 = 12, then 12 / 3 = 4.",
    "rules": [
      "Sharing: Total / Number of people = Items per person",
      "Grouping: Total / Size of each group = Number of groups",
      "Division as repeated subtraction: 12 / 3 means subtract 3 repeatedly until 0",
      "Division is the inverse of multiplication"
