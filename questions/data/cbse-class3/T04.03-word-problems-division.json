    "text": "Division word problems come in two types: sharing (how many each?) and grouping (how many groups?). Look for keywords: 'share equally', 'distribute', 'each gets', 'divide into groups', 'how many in each'. For sharing: Total / Number of people = Each person's share. For grouping: Total / Group size = Number of groups.",
    "rules": [
      "Sharing: 'How many does each get?' = Total / Number of people",
      "Grouping: 'How many groups?' = Total / Items per group",
      "Always check: quotient x divisor should equal the dividend",
      "Use Indian contexts: sweets, rupees, school supplies"
