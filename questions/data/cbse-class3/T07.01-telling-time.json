    "text": "We read time using clocks. An analog clock has two hands: the short hand shows hours, and the long hand shows minutes. There are 12 hours on a clock face and 60 minutes in 1 hour. We use AM for morning (midnight to noon) and PM for afternoon/evening (noon to midnight). 1 day = 24 hours. There are 7 days in a week and 12 months in a year. A calendar helps us find dates and days.",
