    "text": "Shapes are all around us. 2D shapes are flat shapes like triangle (3 sides), rectangle (4 sides, opposite sides equal), square (4 equal sides), and circle (no straight sides). 3D shapes are solid shapes like cube, cuboid, sphere, cylinder, and cone. Perimeter is the total length around a shape. For a rectangle: perimeter = length + breadth + length + breadth. For a square: perimeter = 4 x side. Symmetry means one half of a shape is the mirror image of the other half.",
