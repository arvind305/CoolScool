    "text": "Data handling means collecting information, organising it, and making sense of it. We can collect data by counting, observing, or asking questions (surveys). Tally marks are used to count and record data quickly (every 5th mark crosses the previous 4, making groups of 5). A bar graph uses bars of different heights to show data. Taller bars mean more. We can read bar graphs to find which category has the most, least, or to compare amounts.",
    "rules": [
      "Tally marks: | = 1, || = 2, ||| = 3, |||| = 4, and the 5th crosses them",
      "Bar graph bars must be equal in width",
      "The height of each bar shows the value/count",
      "To find 'how many more': subtract the smaller bar from the larger",
      "To find total: add all the bar values together"
