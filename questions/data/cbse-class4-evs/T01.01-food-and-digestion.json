    "text": "Food provides nutrients that our body needs. Carbohydrates (rice, bread, roti) give energy. Proteins (milk, eggs, dal) help in growth and repair. Fats (butter, oil, ghee) provide energy and warmth. Vitamins and minerals protect us from diseases and keep us healthy. Water helps in digestion and keeps the body cool. Roughage (fibre from fruits, vegetables) helps in removing waste. A balanced diet includes all nutrients in the right amounts. Digestion begins in the mouth where teeth chew food and saliva mixes with it. The food pipe carries food to the stomach. The stomach churns food with digestive juices. The small intestine absorbs nutrients into the blood. The large intestine absorbs water, and waste is removed from the body. We have four types of teeth: incisors cut food, canines tear food, and premolars and molars grind food. Children have milk teeth that fall out and are replaced by permanent teeth. We should brush our teeth twice a day and avoid eating too many sweets.",
