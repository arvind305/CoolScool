    "text": "Plants make their own food through a process called photosynthesis. They use sunlight, water (from roots), and carbon dioxide (from air) along with chlorophyll (green pigment in leaves) to make food. During this process, plants release oxygen. Chlorophyll is the substance that gives leaves their green colour. Flowers are the reproductive parts of a plant. A flower has four main parts: sepals (protect the bud), petals (colourful, attract insects), stamens (male part with anther and filament), and pistil (female part with stigma, style, and ovary). Pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma. Self-pollination happens within the same flower, while cross-pollination happens between two flowers, carried by agents like wind, water, insects, or birds. After pollination, the ovary develops into a fruit and the ovules become seeds. Seeds need to spread away from the parent plant to avoid overcrowding. This is called seed dispersal. Seeds can be dispersed by wind (dandelion, maple), water (coconut, lotus), animals (berries, mango), or explosion (balsam, pea pod).",
