    "text": "Animals can be classified in many ways. One important way is by whether they have a backbone or not. Vertebrates are animals with a backbone (internal skeleton), and invertebrates are animals without a backbone. Vertebrates include five main groups: mammals (warm-blooded, have hair or fur, give birth to babies, feed milk to young ones, e.g. cow, dog, whale, bat), birds (have feathers, lay eggs, most can fly, have beaks, e.g. parrot, eagle, penguin), reptiles (cold-blooded, have dry scaly skin, most lay eggs, e.g. snake, lizard, crocodile, turtle), amphibians (can live on land and in water, have moist skin, lay eggs in water, e.g. frog, toad, salamander), and fish (live in water, have fins and scales, breathe through gills, lay eggs, e.g. rohu, shark, goldfish). Insects are invertebrates with six legs, three body parts (head, thorax, abdomen), and most have wings. Common insects include butterflies, ants, bees, and mosquitoes. Some animals go through metamorphosis, a complete change in body form. The butterfly life cycle has four stages: egg, caterpillar (larva), pupa (chrysalis), and adult butterfly. The frog life cycle has stages: egg, tadpole, froglet, and adult frog.",

      "Reptiles: cold-blooded, dry scaly skin, most lay eggs",
