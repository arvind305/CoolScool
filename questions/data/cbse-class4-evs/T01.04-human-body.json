    "text": "Our body has a skeleton made up of bones that gives shape, provides support, and protects internal organs. The skull protects the brain. The rib cage protects the heart and lungs. The backbone (spine) is made up of small bones called vertebrae and supports the body. Limb bones include the humerus (upper arm), femur (thigh bone, the longest bone). Joints are places where two or more bones meet. Hinge joints (knee, elbow) allow movement in one direction like a door. Ball-and-socket joints (shoulder, hip) allow movement in all directions. Pivot joints (neck) allow rotation. Fixed joints in the skull do not allow movement. Muscles are attached to bones and help us move. They work in pairs: when one muscle contracts (shortens), the other relaxes (lengthens). This is how we bend and straighten our arms and legs. Children have two sets of teeth: 20 milk teeth that fall out and are replaced by 32 permanent teeth. The four types are incisors (cutting), canines (tearing), premolars and molars (grinding). Good posture means sitting and standing straight. Carrying heavy school bags on both shoulders, exercising regularly, and eating calcium-rich foods like milk keep our bones and muscles healthy.",
