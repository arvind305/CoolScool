    "text": "Everything around us that has weight and takes up space is called matter. Matter exists in three states: solid, liquid, and gas. Solids have a definite shape and a definite volume. Examples include books, stones, and chairs. Liquids have a definite volume but no definite shape; they take the shape of their container. Examples include water, milk, and juice. Gases have neither a definite shape nor a definite volume; they fill up the entire space available. Examples include air, steam, and cooking gas. Matter can change from one state to another. Melting is when a solid becomes a liquid (ice to water). Freezing is when a liquid becomes a solid (water to ice). Evaporation is when a liquid becomes a gas (water drying from wet clothes). Condensation is when a gas becomes a liquid (water drops on a cold glass). Materials around us can be natural (wood, cotton, wool, silk) or man-made (plastic, nylon, glass). Materials have different properties: hard or soft, rough or smooth, transparent (clear glass) or opaque (wood). We choose materials based on their properties for different uses.",

      "explanation_correct": "When air is blown into a balloon, the balloon expands because the air takes up space inside it. This proves that air (a gas) occupies space, which is one of the properties of matter.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Air has no colour and is not a liquid. Air is not heavier than water. The balloon expanding proves that air takes up space, confirming that even invisible gases are matter."

      "explanation_correct": "Dew drops form by condensation. At night, the temperature drops and the cool grass surface causes water vapour in the air to condense into tiny water droplets. These droplets are dew.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Evaporation turns liquid to gas. Freezing turns liquid to solid. Melting turns solid to liquid. Dew forms when water vapour in the air condenses into liquid drops on cool surfaces - this is condensation."
