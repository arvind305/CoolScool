    "text": "A force is a push or a pull. When you push a door, pull a drawer, or kick a ball, you are applying force. Forces can make objects start moving, stop moving, change speed, change direction, or change shape. There are different types of forces: muscular force is the force applied by our muscles when we push, pull, lift, or carry things. Gravitational force (gravity) is the force that pulls all objects towards the Earth, which is why things fall when dropped. Frictional force is the force that slows down or stops moving objects; for example, a ball rolling on the ground eventually stops because of friction. Magnetic force is the force by which magnets attract iron objects. Energy is the ability to do work. There are many forms of energy: heat energy (from the sun, fire), light energy (from the sun, bulb), sound energy (from speakers, musical instruments), and electrical energy (from power stations, batteries). The sun is the biggest source of energy. Food gives us energy to work and play. Simple machines are devices that make work easier. Examples include: lever (see-saw, scissors), inclined plane (ramp, slide), pulley (well, flagpole), and wheel and axle (door knob, steering wheel).",

      "explanation_correct": "When the child stops pedalling, there is no force to keep the bicycle moving. Friction between the tyres and the road, and air resistance gradually slow the bicycle down until it stops.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Without pedalling (no push force), friction acts on the bicycle and slows it down. It does not speed up or keep going forever. It also does not stop immediately - it gradually slows."
