    "text": "Weather is the condition of the air at a particular place and time. It includes temperature (hot or cold), rainfall, wind, humidity (moisture in the air), and clouds. Weather can change from day to day or even within the same day. India has several seasons: summer (March to May) is hot, rainy or monsoon season (June to September) brings heavy rains, autumn (October to November) is pleasant, winter (December to February) is cold, and spring (February to March) is pleasant with flowers blooming. During summer, people wear light cotton clothes and drink cold water. During the rainy season, people use umbrellas and raincoats. During winter, people wear woollen clothes and drink hot beverages. The water cycle is a continuous process. The Sun heats water in rivers, lakes, and oceans, causing it to evaporate and become water vapour. This vapour rises, cools, and condenses to form clouds. When clouds become heavy with water droplets, they release water as rain (precipitation). Rain fills rivers, lakes, and seeps into the ground, and the cycle continues. Weather affects our daily lives: the clothes we wear, the food we eat, the games we play, and the festivals we celebrate.",
