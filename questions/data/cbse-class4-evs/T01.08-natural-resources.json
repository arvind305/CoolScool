    "text": "Soil is the top layer of the Earth's surface where plants grow. There are three main types of soil: sandy soil (loose, has large particles, drains water quickly, not very good for most plants), clayey soil (sticky when wet, has very fine particles, holds water tightly, used for making pots), and loamy soil (a mixture of sand, clay, and humus, best for growing plants). Humus is the dark-coloured decayed remains of dead plants and animals in soil. Humus makes soil fertile and provides nutrients for plants. Rocks are hard, solid materials found on Earth. They can be as big as mountains or as small as pebbles. Rocks are made up of minerals. Minerals are natural substances found in rocks and the Earth. Important minerals include iron (used for building), gold (used for jewellery), diamond (hardest natural substance), salt (used for cooking), and coal (used as fuel). Natural resources are things we get from nature that are useful to us, such as water, air, soil, minerals, forests, and sunlight. Renewable resources can be replaced naturally (water, forests, sunlight, wind). Non-renewable resources take millions of years to form and cannot be easily replaced (coal, oil, natural gas, minerals). Conservation means saving and protecting natural resources. We can conserve by saving water, planting trees, reducing waste, recycling, and avoiding pollution.",
