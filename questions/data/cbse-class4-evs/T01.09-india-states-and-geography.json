    "text": "India is a large country in South Asia. It has 28 states and 8 union territories. The capital of India is New Delhi. Each state has its own capital city. India has many different physical features. The Himalayas are the highest mountain range in the world and are in the north of India. Mount Everest, the tallest peak, is in the Himalayas on the border of Nepal. The Northern Plains are flat lands formed by rivers like the Ganga, Yamuna, and Brahmaputra. These plains are very fertile and good for farming. The Thar Desert is in the west, in Rajasthan. It is a hot, sandy desert. The Deccan Plateau is a large raised flat area in southern India. India has many important rivers: the Ganga, Yamuna, Brahmaputra, Godavari, Krishna, Narmada, and Kaveri. India is surrounded by the Arabian Sea on the west, the Bay of Bengal on the east, and the Indian Ocean to the south. India's neighbouring countries are Pakistan, China, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka (across the sea). India also has islands: the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal and the Lakshadweep Islands in the Arabian Sea.",
