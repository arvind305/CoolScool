    "text": "India has many famous historical monuments that tell us about our rich history and culture. The Taj Mahal in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal. It is made of white marble and is one of the Seven Wonders of the World. The Red Fort (Lal Qila) in Delhi was built by Shah Jahan and is made of red sandstone. Every year on Independence Day (15th August), the Prime Minister hoists the national flag at the Red Fort. The Qutub Minar in Delhi is one of the tallest brick minarets in the world, built by Qutub-ud-din Aibak. The Konark Sun Temple in Odisha was built by King Narasimhadeva I and is shaped like a giant chariot of the Sun God with huge stone wheels. The Ajanta Caves in Maharashtra are ancient rock-cut caves with beautiful paintings and sculptures of Buddha. These caves are over 2,000 years old. These monuments are part of our national heritage. Heritage means things of value passed down from the past. We must preserve and protect our monuments by not littering, not writing on walls, and following rules when visiting them. Many Indian monuments are UNESCO World Heritage Sites, which means the whole world recognises their importance.",
