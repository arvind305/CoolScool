    "text": "India is a democratic country, which means people choose their leaders by voting. Adults who are 18 years or older can vote in elections. The government makes rules and laws to keep people safe and to make sure things run smoothly. There are different levels of government. In villages, the local government is called the Panchayat, headed by a Sarpanch. In towns and cities, the local government is called the Municipality or Municipal Corporation, headed by a Mayor. The local government takes care of roads, water supply, garbage collection, streetlights, and parks. Public services are services provided for the benefit of all people. The Police keep us safe, catch criminals, and maintain law and order. We call 100 (or 112) in an emergency for police help. The Fire Brigade puts out fires and rescues people from fire and other emergencies. We call 101 for fire emergencies. Hospitals and doctors take care of our health. We call 108 for an ambulance. Schools provide education, and the post office delivers letters and parcels. The government needs money to provide these services. This money comes from taxes. Taxes are money that people pay to the government from their earnings. The government uses tax money to build roads, schools, hospitals, and to pay for public services.",
