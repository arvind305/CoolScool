    "text": "India is a land of incredible diversity. Despite having many differences, Indians live together in unity. This is called 'Unity in Diversity'. India has hundreds of languages. The Constitution of India recognises 22 official languages listed in the Eighth Schedule, including Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Punjabi, Odia, and Urdu. Hindi is the most widely spoken language, and English is used as an additional official language. Different states have different main languages. India celebrates many festivals throughout the year. Diwali (Festival of Lights) is celebrated by Hindus, Sikhs, and Jains. Eid is celebrated by Muslims. Christmas is celebrated by Christians. Baisakhi is a harvest festival celebrated in Punjab. Pongal is a harvest festival in Tamil Nadu. Bihu is celebrated in Assam. Onam is celebrated in Kerala. Holi is the festival of colours. Different regions of India have different traditional clothing. In the north, people wear salwar kameez, kurta pyjama, and saris. In the south, men wear dhotis (called mundu or lungi) and women wear saris. In the northeast, people have their own beautiful traditional dresses. India has a rich food diversity. North Indian food includes roti, dal, paneer, and rajma. South Indian food includes dosa, idli, sambhar, and rice. West Indian food includes dhokla, vada pav, and poha. East Indian food includes fish curry, rosogolla, and luchi.
