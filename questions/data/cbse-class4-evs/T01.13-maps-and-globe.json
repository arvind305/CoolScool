    "text": "A globe is a small model of the Earth. It is round like a ball because the Earth is shaped like a sphere. A globe shows us all the continents and oceans. It spins on an axis, just like the Earth. A map is a flat drawing of the Earth or a part of it on paper. Maps can show the whole world, a country, a state, a city, or even a neighbourhood. There are different types of maps: physical maps show mountains, rivers, and plains; political maps show countries, states, and cities; and road maps show roads and highways. The globe and maps show 7 continents: Asia (the largest, where India is), Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica (the coldest), Europe, and Australia (the smallest). There are 5 oceans: Pacific Ocean (largest), Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Arctic Ocean (smallest), and Southern Ocean. On a map, there are four main directions: North (N), South (S), East (E), and West (W). The sun rises in the East and sets in the West. Maps use symbols to show different things: blue for water, green for forests, brown for mountains, black dots for cities, and lines for roads and rivers. A compass rose on a map shows the directions. The legend or key of a map explains what each symbol means. Learning to read maps helps us find places and understand the world around us.",
