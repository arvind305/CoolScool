    "text": "Every child has certain rights. Rights are things that every person deserves to have or do. The United Nations made a list of children's rights called the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. In India, children have important rights. The Right to Education (RTE) Act says that every child between the ages of 6 and 14 has the right to free education in a nearby school. This means no child can be denied the chance to go to school. Children also have the right to be safe, the right to good food and health, the right to play, and the right to be treated equally regardless of whether they are a boy or girl. Gender equality means boys and girls have equal rights and should be treated fairly. Girls have the same right to education, play, and opportunities as boys. No child should be treated unfairly because of their gender. Along with rights come responsibilities. Responsibilities are duties or things we should do. At home, responsibilities include helping with household chores, respecting elders, being kind to siblings, and keeping our room clean. At school, responsibilities include attending regularly, completing homework, following rules, respecting teachers and classmates, and keeping the classroom clean. In the community, responsibilities include not littering, following traffic rules, respecting public property, being kind to animals, and helping elderly people. When everyone follows their responsibilities, the community becomes a better and safer place for all.",
