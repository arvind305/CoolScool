    "text": "The human body has several organ systems that work together. The nervous system controls and coordinates all body activities. It consists of the brain (control centre), spinal cord (connects brain to body), and nerves (carry messages). The circulatory system pumps blood through the body using the heart, arteries, veins, and capillaries. Blood carries oxygen and nutrients to all parts and removes waste. The respiratory system helps us breathe. The lungs take in oxygen from the air and release carbon dioxide. We have five sense organs: eyes (sight), ears (hearing), nose (smell), tongue (taste), and skin (touch). We must take care of our body systems through proper hygiene, exercise, and nutrition.",
