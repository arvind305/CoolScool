    "text": "A cell is the basic unit of life. All living things are made up of cells. Robert Hooke first discovered cells in 1665 when he looked at a thin slice of cork under a microscope. Every cell has three main parts: the cell membrane (outer covering), cytoplasm (jelly-like substance inside), and nucleus (controls the cell). Plant cells have some extra parts: a cell wall (rigid outer cover), chloroplasts (contain chlorophyll for making food), and a large vacuole. Organisms made of a single cell are called unicellular (like amoeba and bacteria). Organisms made of many cells are called multicellular (like humans, mango trees, and elephants).",
