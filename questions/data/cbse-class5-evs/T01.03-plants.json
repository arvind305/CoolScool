    "text": "Plants are unique living organisms that can make their own food through a process called photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, plants use sunlight, water (from soil through roots), and carbon dioxide (from air through stomata in leaves) to make glucose (food) and release oxygen. Chlorophyll, the green pigment in leaves, captures sunlight energy. Plants also respire, taking in oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide, just like animals. Respiration occurs all day and night, while photosynthesis only happens during the day. Plants reproduce through seeds (sexual reproduction) and through vegetative parts like stems, roots, and leaves (vegetative reproduction). Seed germination requires water, air (oxygen), and warmth. Seeds are dispersed by wind, water, animals, and by bursting.",
