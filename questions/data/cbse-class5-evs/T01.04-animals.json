    "text": "Animals live in different habitats and have special features called adaptations that help them survive. Desert animals like the camel have long eyelashes and can store fat in their hump. Aquatic animals like fish have gills and streamlined bodies. Polar animals like the polar bear have thick fur and fat layers. Forest animals are adapted to climb, run, or hide. A food chain shows how energy passes from one living thing to another: producers (plants) → primary consumers (herbivores) → secondary consumers (carnivores) → decomposers (fungi, bacteria). India has many endangered species like the Bengal tiger, one-horned rhinoceros, and Asiatic lion. Wildlife is protected through national parks and wildlife sanctuaries like Jim Corbett National Park and Kaziranga National Park.",

      "explanation_correct": "Different habitats have different conditions (temperature, water availability, food sources). Animals develop adaptations suited to their specific habitat. Desert animals need heat tolerance, polar animals need cold protection, and aquatic animals need to breathe and move in water.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Animals do not choose their adaptations. Each habitat poses different challenges, so animals in different habitats have evolved different features to survive those specific conditions."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Decomposers play a crucial role in breaking down dead matter and returning nutrients to the soil. Without them, dead organisms would accumulate, nutrients would not be recycled, and the entire ecosystem would be disrupted."
