    "text": "Our body needs nutrients from food to grow, get energy, and stay healthy. There are six main nutrients: carbohydrates (energy), proteins (body building), fats (energy and warmth), vitamins (protection from diseases), minerals (body functions), and water (all body processes). A balanced diet contains all these nutrients in the right amounts. Deficiency diseases occur when a nutrient is lacking: scurvy (Vitamin C), rickets (Vitamin D), night blindness (Vitamin A), anaemia (iron), and goitre (iodine). Food can be preserved by refrigeration, drying, pickling, adding sugar or salt, and canning. Good hygiene practices like washing hands before eating, drinking clean water, and keeping food covered help prevent diseases.",
