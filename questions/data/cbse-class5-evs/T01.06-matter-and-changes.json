    "text": "Everything around us that has mass and occupies space is called matter. Matter exists in three states: solid, liquid, and gas. Solids have a definite shape and volume (e.g., stone, book). Liquids have a definite volume but take the shape of the container (e.g., water, milk). Gases have no definite shape or volume and fill the entire container (e.g., air, oxygen). Matter can change from one state to another: melting (solid to liquid), freezing (liquid to solid), evaporation (liquid to gas), and condensation (gas to liquid). Changes in matter are of two types: physical changes are reversible and no new substance is formed (e.g., ice melting), and chemical changes are usually irreversible and a new substance is formed (e.g., burning paper, rusting). The water cycle shows how water moves through different states in nature: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection.",
