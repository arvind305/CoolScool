    "text": "A force is a push or pull that can change the speed, direction, or shape of an object. Forces can be contact forces (require touching, like muscular and frictional) or non-contact forces (act from a distance, like gravitational and magnetic). Friction is a force that opposes motion between two surfaces in contact. It is useful (helps us walk, brakes stop vehicles) and sometimes harmful (causes wear and tear). Simple machines like levers, pulleys, inclined planes, and wheel-and-axle make work easier by changing the direction or amount of force needed. Energy is the ability to do work. It exists in many forms: kinetic (motion), potential (stored), heat, light, sound, and electrical. Energy can change from one form to another (transformation) but cannot be created or destroyed (conservation of energy).",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Clapping involves moving hands (kinetic energy) coming together to produce sound. The energy transformation is from kinetic energy to sound energy (and some heat from the impact)."
