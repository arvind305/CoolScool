    "text": "Our environment consists of all living things (plants, animals, humans) and non-living things (air, water, soil, sunlight) around us. Pollution is the harmful contamination of the environment. Air pollution is caused by vehicle exhaust, factory smoke, and burning waste, leading to breathing problems and smog. Water pollution is caused by factory waste, sewage, and pesticides dumped into rivers and lakes, making water unsafe and harming aquatic life. Land pollution is caused by plastic waste, garbage, and chemical dumping, making soil infertile. We can protect the environment by following the 3Rs: Reduce (use less), Reuse (use again), and Recycle (convert waste into new products). Planting trees (afforestation), properly disposing of waste, and using biodegradable products help conserve the environment. Global warming is the gradual increase in Earth's temperature due to gases like carbon dioxide trapping heat in the atmosphere.",
