    "text": "India is a vast country with incredible diversity. Over 1.4 billion people live here, speaking different languages, following different religions, wearing different clothes, eating different foods, and celebrating different festivals. Yet, we all live together as one nation. This is called 'Unity in Diversity'. India has 22 officially recognised languages listed in the Eighth Schedule of the Constitution, including Hindi, Bengali, Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, and many more. Hindi and English serve as link languages. The major religions practised in India include Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Sikhism, Buddhism, and Jainism. Each religion teaches peace, love, and respect. Indians celebrate many festivals together, such as Diwali, Eid, Christmas, Baisakhi, Pongal, Onam, Bihu, and Holi. Our national symbols unite us: the tricolour flag (saffron, white, green with the Ashoka Chakra), the national emblem (Lion Capital of Ashoka), the national anthem ('Jana Gana Mana'), the national animal (Bengal tiger), the national bird (Indian peacock), and the national flower (lotus). Different states have their own traditional clothing, food, and dance forms, making India a colourful and vibrant country.",
