  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "India was under British rule for nearly 200 years. The British East India Company came to India for trade in the 1600s but gradually took control of the country. The first major revolt against British rule was the Revolt of 1857 (also called the First War of Independence), led by brave fighters like Rani Laxmi Bai of Jhansi and Mangal Pandey. Many great leaders fought for India's freedom. Mahatma Gandhi, called the Father of the Nation, believed in non-violence (ahimsa) and led movements like the Dandi March (Salt March, 1930) and the Quit India Movement (1942) with the slogan 'Do or Die'. Jawaharlal Nehru became India's first Prime Minister and was lovingly called Chacha Nehru by children. Subhash Chandra Bose (Netaji) formed the Indian National Army (INA) and gave the famous call 'Give me blood, I will give you freedom'. Bhagat Singh was a young revolutionary who sacrificed his life for freedom at the age of 23. India finally gained independence on 15 August 1947, and the tricolour was hoisted at the Red Fort in Delhi. The Indian Constitution came into effect on 26 January 1950, which we celebrate as Republic Day.",
