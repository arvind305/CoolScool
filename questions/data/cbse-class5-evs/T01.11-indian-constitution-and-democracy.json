    "text": "The Indian Constitution is the supreme law of India. It was adopted on 26 November 1949 and came into effect on 26 January 1950. Dr. B.R. Ambedkar was the chairman of the Drafting Committee and is known as the Father of the Indian Constitution. The Constitution gives Fundamental Rights to all citizens, including the Right to Equality (all people are equal before the law), Right to Freedom (freedom of speech, movement, etc.), Right against Exploitation (no child labour, no forced labour), and Right to Education (free education for children aged 6-14). Citizens also have Fundamental Duties such as respecting the national flag and anthem, protecting the environment, and developing scientific temper. India is a democratic republic, which means the people elect their leaders through elections. Every citizen who is 18 years or older has the right to vote. The Indian Parliament has two houses: the Lok Sabha (House of the People) and the Rajya Sabha (Council of States). The President is the head of state, and the Prime Minister is the head of government. At the village level, the Panchayati Raj system (Gram Panchayat, Panchayat Samiti, Zilla Parishad) provides local self-government.",
