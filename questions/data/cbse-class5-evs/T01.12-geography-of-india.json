    "text": "India is a large country in South Asia with diverse physical features. The Himalayas in the north are the youngest and highest mountain range in the world, with Mount Everest being the tallest peak. South of the Himalayas lies the Indo-Gangetic Plain, one of the most fertile plains in the world, formed by rivers like the Ganga, Yamuna, and Brahmaputra. The Deccan Plateau is a large, triangular plateau in southern India, bounded by the Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats. The Thar Desert in western Rajasthan is a hot, sandy desert. India has long coastlines along the Arabian Sea in the west and the Bay of Bengal in the east. Major rivers include the Ganga, Yamuna, Brahmaputra, Godavari, Krishna, Narmada, and Kaveri. India has three main seasons: summer (March-June), monsoon/rainy season (July-September), and winter (October-February). India has 28 states and 8 Union Territories. It shares borders with Pakistan, China, Nepal, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and is close to Sri Lanka across the Palk Strait.",
