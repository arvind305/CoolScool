    "text": "A globe is a small model of the Earth that shows its round (spherical) shape. It shows how the continents and oceans are arranged on the Earth's surface. A map is a flat drawing of the Earth's surface or a part of it. While a globe shows the whole Earth, a map can show the whole world, a country, a city, or even a neighbourhood. There are seven continents: Asia (largest), Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia (smallest). There are five oceans: Pacific (largest), Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic (smallest). Latitude lines run horizontally around the Earth. The Equator is the most important latitude line at 0 degrees, dividing the Earth into the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Longitude lines run vertically from the North Pole to the South Pole. The Prime Meridian is at 0 degrees longitude. The four main directions are North, South, East, and West. Maps use symbols and colours to represent features: blue for water, green for forests/low land, and brown for mountains/hills. A map scale helps us understand the relationship between distance on a map and actual distance on the ground.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The Earth's tilt causes seasons. Day and night are caused by the Earth's rotation (spinning). Earthquakes are caused by movements in the Earth's crust. Rain is caused by the water cycle. The tilt determines which parts of the Earth get more sunlight."
