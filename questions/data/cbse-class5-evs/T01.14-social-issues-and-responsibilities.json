    "text": "As responsible citizens of India, we must be aware of important social issues and do our part to make society better. The Right to Education Act (RTE, 2009) ensures that every child between 6 and 14 years gets free and compulsory education. Child labour (making children work instead of going to school) is illegal and wrong. Boys and girls are equal and deserve the same opportunities in education, sports, and careers. Gender equality means treating everyone with equal respect regardless of whether they are male or female. We also have a responsibility to protect the environment by saving water, saving electricity, planting trees, and reducing waste. People with disabilities deserve respect, support, and equal opportunities. Ramps for wheelchair users, Braille for the visually impaired, and sign language for the hearing impaired are ways to include everyone. Being a responsible citizen means following rules, helping others, respecting elders, caring for public property, and contributing to the community. Every person, including children, can make a positive difference in society.",
