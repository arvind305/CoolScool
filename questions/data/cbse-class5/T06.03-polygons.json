    "text": "A polygon is a closed figure made of line segments. Triangles have 3 sides and angles totaling 180°. Triangles can be classified by sides (equilateral, isosceles, scalene) or by angles (acute, right, obtuse). Quadrilaterals have 4 sides and angles totaling 360°. Types include square, rectangle, parallelogram, rhombus, and trapezium. Pentagon has 5 sides, hexagon has 6 sides.",
