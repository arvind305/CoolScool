    "text": "A circle is a closed curve where all points are at the same distance from a fixed point called the centre. The radius is the distance from the centre to any point on the circle. The diameter is a line segment passing through the centre connecting two points on the circle. Diameter = 2 × Radius. A chord is a line segment joining any two points on the circle. The diameter is the longest chord. The circumference is the distance around the circle.",
