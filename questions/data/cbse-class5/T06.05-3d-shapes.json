    "text": "3D shapes (solids) have length, breadth, and height. They have faces (flat surfaces), edges (lines where faces meet), and vertices (corners where edges meet). Common 3D shapes include cube (6 square faces), cuboid (6 rectangular faces), cylinder (2 circular faces + curved surface), cone (1 circular face + curved surface + apex), sphere (completely curved, no face/edge/vertex). Euler's formula states: Faces + Vertices - Edges = 2 for polyhedra. A net is a flat pattern that folds into a 3D shape.",
