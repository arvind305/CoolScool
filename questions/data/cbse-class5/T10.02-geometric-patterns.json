    "text": "Geometric patterns use shapes that repeat or grow in a predictable way. A repeating pattern has a group of shapes (the core) that repeats over and over. A growing pattern has shapes that change in a regular way (e.g., one more triangle each time). Symmetry means one half of a figure mirrors the other. A line of symmetry divides a figure into two identical halves.",
    "rules": ["A repeating pattern has a core unit that repeats (e.g., circle-square-circle-square)", "A growing pattern changes in size or number of shapes in a regular way", "A line of symmetry divides a shape into two matching halves", "Some shapes have more than one line of symmetry", "A circle has infinite lines of symmetry", "A square has 4 lines of symmetry; a rectangle has 2"]
