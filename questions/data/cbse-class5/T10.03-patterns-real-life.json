    "text": "Patterns are everywhere in the real world — in nature (petals, honeycomb, snowflakes), in Indian art and culture (rangoli, kolam, mehndi, jali work, block printing), and in everyday life (tiles, wallpaper, fabric). Recognising, describing, and creating patterns helps us understand structure and predict what comes next.",
    "rules": [
      "Nature has many patterns: flower petals, honeycomb hexagons, spirals in shells",
      "Indian art uses repeating patterns: rangoli, kolam, mehndi designs, tile work",
      "Patterns in architecture: jali screens, floor tiles, window grills",
      "A pattern rule tells you how the pattern repeats or grows",
      "You can create your own patterns by choosing a shape/colour rule and applying it",
      "Describing a pattern means stating what repeats and how"
