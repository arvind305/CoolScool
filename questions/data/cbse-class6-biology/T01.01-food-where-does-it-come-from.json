  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Food is essential for all living organisms. We get our food from plants and animals. Plants provide us with fruits, vegetables, cereals, pulses, and spices. Different parts of a plant such as roots (carrot, radish), stems (potato, ginger), leaves (spinach, cabbage), flowers (cauliflower, broccoli), fruits (mango, apple), and seeds (wheat, rice, mustard) are used as food. Animals provide us with milk, eggs, meat, honey, and other products. Based on their eating habits, animals are classified as herbivores (plant eaters like cow, deer), carnivores (meat eaters like lion, tiger), and omnivores (eating both plants and animals like bear, crow, human).",

      "Plants and animals are the two main sources of food.",
      "Different parts of plants are edible: roots, stems, leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds.",

      "Herbivores eat only plants (e.g., cow, rabbit, deer).",
      "Carnivores eat only other animals (e.g., lion, tiger, hawk).",
      "Omnivores eat both plants and animals (e.g., bear, crow, human beings).",
      "Ingredients are the materials needed to prepare a food item.",
      "Most food items are prepared using ingredients from both plant and animal sources."

      "explanation_correct": "Priya's answer is incorrect. Mushrooms are NOT plants — they are fungi. Fungi are a separate group of organisms that do not make their own food. They grow on decaying organic matter.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Paneer is indeed made from milk, an animal product (Aman is correct). Rice is from seeds of the rice plant (Rohit is correct). Honey is indeed made by bees (Sara is correct). Mushrooms are fungi, not plants, so Priya's answer is incorrect."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The mustard plant gives us seeds and leaves (2 parts — oil comes from the same seeds). The rice plant gives mainly seeds, and the carrot plant gives mainly roots. The banana plant provides 3 distinct edible parts: fruit, flower, and stem."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Honey is not simply collected nectar — bees chemically transform the nectar using enzymes. This biological processing by an animal makes it an animal product, not a plant product. It is certainly not a mineral product."
