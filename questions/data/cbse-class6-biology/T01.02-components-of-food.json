    "text": "Food contains various components called nutrients that our body needs. The major nutrients are carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals. Carbohydrates (found in rice, wheat, sugar, potatoes) and fats (found in oils, butter, ghee, nuts) provide energy. Proteins (found in pulses, milk, eggs, fish, meat) help in body growth and repair. Vitamins (A, B, C, D) and minerals (iron, calcium, iodine) are needed in small amounts to protect us from diseases and keep the body healthy. Water and roughage (dietary fibre) are also essential components of food. A balanced diet contains all nutrients in the right proportions. Deficiency of nutrients leads to diseases: scurvy (lack of Vitamin C), rickets (lack of Vitamin D), beri-beri (lack of Vitamin B1), goitre (lack of iodine), anaemia (lack of iron), and night blindness (lack of Vitamin A).",
