    "text": "Plants are classified into herbs, shrubs, and trees based on their size and stem type. Herbs are small plants with soft, green stems (e.g., mint, coriander, wheat). Shrubs are medium-sized plants with hard stems that branch near the base (e.g., rose, jasmine, tulsi). Trees are tall, large plants with a hard, thick main stem called trunk (e.g., mango, neem, peepal). Climbers have weak stems and climb on supports (e.g., money plant, grapevine), while creepers spread along the ground (e.g., pumpkin, watermelon). Plants have different parts: roots absorb water and minerals and anchor the plant; the stem transports water and nutrients; leaves make food through photosynthesis; and flowers help in reproduction. Roots can be tap roots (one main root with branches, e.g., carrot) or fibrous roots (many thin roots from the base, e.g., grass). Leaves show either reticulate venation (net-like veins, e.g., mango leaf) or parallel venation (veins running parallel, e.g., grass). A flower has sepals, petals, stamens (male part), and pistil (female part).",
