    "text": "The human body can move because of the skeletal system (bones) and muscular system (muscles) working together. The human skeleton has 206 bones that provide shape, support, and protection. Bones are connected at joints, which allow different types of movement. A ball and socket joint (at the shoulder and hip) allows movement in all directions. A hinge joint (at the knee and elbow) allows movement in only one direction, like a door hinge. A pivot joint (at the neck) allows rotational movement. Fixed joints (in the skull) do not allow any movement. Cartilage is a softer, more flexible tissue found at the tip of the nose, in the ear, and between vertebrae. Muscles are attached to bones and cause movement by contracting (becoming shorter) and relaxing (becoming longer). They work in pairs. Different animals move in different ways: earthworms use muscles to expand and contract their body; snails use a muscular foot; fish use fins and tail; birds use wings; and snakes use their long spine and muscles to slither.",

      "explanation_correct": "The mucus (slime) produced by a snail reduces friction between its muscular foot and the ground surface, allowing the snail to slide smoothly, even over rough surfaces. It also protects the snail's foot from sharp objects.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The mucus is primarily for locomotion, not for eating, breathing, or navigation. It creates a smooth, lubricated surface that allows the snail's muscular foot to glide over surfaces."

      "explanation_correct": "The skeletal system is important for movement because bones provide a rigid framework that muscles can pull against. Without this rigid structure, muscle contraction would not produce effective body movement.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "While bones do produce blood cells and store calcium, these are not related to movement. Bones do not produce heat. For movement, the key role of bones is providing a rigid framework for muscles to pull on."
