    "text": "Every living organism lives in a specific place called its habitat, which provides food, water, shelter, and suitable conditions for survival. Habitats are broadly classified as terrestrial (land-based) and aquatic (water-based). Terrestrial habitats include deserts, forests, grasslands, and mountains. Aquatic habitats include freshwater (ponds, lakes, rivers) and marine (oceans, seas). Organisms develop special features called adaptations that help them survive in their habitat. For example, camels have long legs, padded feet, and humps to survive in deserts; fish have gills, fins, and streamlined bodies for life in water; and cacti have thick stems and spines instead of leaves to conserve water. Living organisms have certain characteristics: they need food (nutrition), breathe (respiration), remove waste (excretion), respond to stimuli (sensitivity), reproduce, grow, and move. A habitat has two types of components: biotic (living things like plants, animals, microorganisms) and abiotic (non-living things like air, water, soil, sunlight, temperature).",
