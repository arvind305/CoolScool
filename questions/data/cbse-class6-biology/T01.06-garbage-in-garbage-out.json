    "text": "Every household generates garbage (waste). This garbage can be classified into two types based on whether it decomposes naturally. Biodegradable waste is waste that can be broken down by microorganisms into simpler substances. Examples include food scraps, paper, cotton, dead leaves, and animal dung. Non-biodegradable waste cannot be easily broken down by microorganisms and stays in the environment for a very long time. Examples include plastic, glass, metal cans, and polythene bags. Composting is the process of converting biodegradable waste into useful manure by letting microorganisms decompose it. Vermicomposting is composting with the help of redworms (earthworms), which eat organic waste and produce nutrient-rich compost. The 3Rs — Reduce (use less), Reuse (use again without changing), and Recycle (process waste to make new products) — are important principles for waste management. Burning garbage causes harmful air pollution, and dumping in landfills takes up valuable land space. Proper waste management through segregation, composting, and the 3Rs helps protect our environment.",
