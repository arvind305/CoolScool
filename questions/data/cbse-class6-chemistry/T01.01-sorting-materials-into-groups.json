  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "We can sort materials into groups based on their properties such as appearance, hardness, solubility in water, transparency, and whether they float or sink. By observing these properties, we can classify objects and choose the right material for different uses. For example, glass is used for windows because it is transparent, and wood is used for furniture because it is hard and strong.",
    "rules": [
      "Materials can be grouped based on properties like appearance, hardness, solubility, and transparency.",
      "Transparent materials allow light to pass through completely; translucent materials allow some light; opaque materials block light.",
      "Soluble substances dissolve in water; insoluble substances do not dissolve in water.",
      "Hard materials cannot be easily scratched or compressed; soft materials can be.",
      "Materials with lustre appear shiny; metals generally have lustre.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct matching is: window pane needs transparency, frying pan needs heat conductivity, and raincoat needs to be waterproof. These are the primary properties that make each material suitable for its purpose."

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Although steel is heavier than water, a ship is hollow and contains a lot of air inside. This makes the overall weight of the ship spread over a large volume, making it lighter overall than the water it displaces, so it floats.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Steel does not become lighter in water, and water does not become heavier near ships. Ships float because they are hollow and filled with air, making the overall structure light enough compared to the water displaced."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Copper is used inside the wire because it is an excellent conductor of electricity, allowing current to flow through it. Plastic is used as covering because it is an insulator and does not conduct electricity, which prevents electric shocks.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Copper is a conductor, not an insulator. Plastic is an insulator, not a conductor. Together they work perfectly: copper carries electricity inside while plastic outside prevents shock."
