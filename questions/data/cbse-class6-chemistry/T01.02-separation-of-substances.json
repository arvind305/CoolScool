    "text": "In our daily life, we often need to separate mixtures to obtain pure substances or to remove unwanted materials. Different methods of separation are used depending on the properties of the substances in the mixture. Common methods include handpicking, winnowing, sieving, threshing, sedimentation, decantation, filtration, and evaporation. The choice of method depends on the differences in properties such as size, weight, and solubility of the components.",
    "rules": [
      "Handpicking is used to separate slightly larger impurities from a mixture by hand.",
      "Winnowing uses wind to separate lighter husk from heavier grain.",
      "Sieving separates particles of different sizes using a sieve with small holes.",
      "Threshing separates grain from stalks by beating or using machines.",
      "Sedimentation allows heavy particles to settle at the bottom of water.",
      "Decantation is pouring off clear liquid after sedimentation without disturbing the sediment.",
      "Filtration separates insoluble solids from liquids using a filter paper or cloth.",
      "Evaporation is used to obtain a dissolved solid from a solution by heating.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation_correct": "Winnowing relies on wind blowing away lighter particles. Both sand and gravel are heavy, so wind cannot carry either of them away effectively. Sieving (based on size difference) would be the correct method.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Winnowing fails here not because of colour or size, but because both materials are too heavy for wind to separate them. Winnowing works best when one component is very light (like husk)."
