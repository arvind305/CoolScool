    "text": "Changes are happening around us all the time. Some changes can be reversed, meaning we can get back the original substance, and these are called reversible changes. Other changes cannot be reversed and are called irreversible changes. Changes can also be classified as physical changes (no new substance is formed) or chemical changes (a new substance is formed). Heating and cooling cause materials to expand and contract respectively.",

      "Reversible changes can be undone to get back the original substance (e.g., melting of ice, folding paper).",
      "Irreversible changes cannot be undone (e.g., burning of paper, cooking an egg).",
      "Physical changes do not produce a new substance; only the shape, size, or state changes.",
      "Chemical changes produce a new substance with different properties.",
      "Most materials expand when heated and contract when cooled.",
