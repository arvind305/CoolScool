    "text": "Water is essential for all living things and is found in three forms: solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (water vapour). Water continuously moves through a cycle called the water cycle, which includes evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. Water is called a universal solvent because it can dissolve many substances. We must conserve water because only a small percentage of Earth's water is fresh and usable.",
    "rules": [
      "Water exists in three forms: solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (water vapour/steam).",
      "The water cycle involves evaporation, condensation, cloud formation, and precipitation (rain, snow, hail).",
      "Evaporation is the change of liquid water into water vapour due to heat.",
      "Condensation is the change of water vapour into liquid water on cooling.",
      "Water is called the universal solvent because it dissolves more substances than any other liquid.",
      "Only about 3% of Earth's water is fresh water; most is in oceans (salty).",
      "Rainwater harvesting and reducing wastage are important water conservation methods.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "This is false. The sun is the driving force of the water cycle. Without its heat energy, evaporation would not occur, and the entire cycle of evaporation, condensation, and precipitation would stop."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "Powdered sugar dissolves faster because it has a much larger surface area in contact with water compared to sugar cubes. More surface area allows water to dissolve the sugar particles more quickly.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Both are the same substance (sugar) and both are soluble, but powdered sugar dissolves faster. The finer particles of powdered sugar expose more surface to water, speeding up dissolution."

      "question_text": "A town gets water from a river, but the river level drops every summer. The town council considers two options: (1) Dig deeper wells, (2) Build check dams and rainwater harvesting systems. Which is the better long-term solution and why?",
      "options": [
        { "id": "A", "text": "Option 1, because deeper wells always have water" },
        { "id": "B", "text": "Option 2, because check dams and rainwater harvesting recharge groundwater and store rainwater for dry months" },
        { "id": "C", "text": "Option 1, because wells are cheaper" },
        { "id": "D", "text": "Neither option will help" }
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Check dams slow down river water and help it seep underground, recharging groundwater. Rainwater harvesting stores rainwater for later use. Together, these increase the overall water availability sustainably, unlike deeper wells which only deplete groundwater faster.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Deeper wells are not a sustainable solution because they deplete groundwater further. Check dams and rainwater harvesting are better long-term solutions because they replenish water sources rather than just extracting more."
