    "text": "Motion is a change in the position of an object with respect to time. There are different types of motion such as rectilinear (straight line), circular, rotational, periodic, and oscillatory. To measure distances accurately, we use standard units of measurement. The SI unit of length is the metre (m), and we use instruments like rulers, metre scales, and measuring tapes for measurement.",
    "rules": [
      "Motion is a change in the position of an object over time.",
      "Rectilinear motion is motion in a straight line.",
      "Circular motion is motion along a circular path.",
      "Rotational motion is spinning of an object about an axis.",
      "Periodic motion repeats itself at regular intervals of time.",
      "Oscillatory motion is a to-and-fro motion about a fixed point.",
      "The SI unit of length is the metre (m).",
      "1 km = 1000 m, 1 m = 100 cm, 1 cm = 10 mm.",
      "While measuring, eyes should be placed directly in front of the reading to avoid parallax error.",
      "Standard units were adopted so that measurements are uniform worldwide."

      "explanation_correct": "The Earth revolves around the Sun (circular/rectilinear along its orbit), rotates on its own axis (rotational), and both these motions repeat at regular intervals (periodic — one revolution in a year, one rotation in a day). It shows multiple types of motion simultaneously.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "A falling stone has only rectilinear motion and does not repeat. A swing shows oscillatory and periodic motion but not rotational. A stationary bicycle has no motion. The Earth exhibits circular, rotational, and periodic motion all at once."
