    "text": "Light is a form of energy that enables us to see objects. Objects that emit their own light are called luminous objects, while objects that do not emit light are called non-luminous objects. Materials can be classified as transparent, translucent, or opaque based on how much light passes through them. When an opaque object is placed in the path of light, a shadow is formed on the opposite side. A plane mirror reflects light and forms an image that is erect, of the same size, and laterally inverted.",
    "rules": [
      "Light travels in a straight line (rectilinear propagation of light).",
      "Luminous objects produce their own light (e.g., Sun, candle, electric bulb).",
      "Non-luminous objects do not produce their own light (e.g., Moon, table, book).",
      "Transparent objects allow all light to pass through (e.g., clear glass, water).",
      "Translucent objects allow only some light to pass through (e.g., frosted glass, oiled paper).",
      "Opaque objects do not allow any light to pass through (e.g., wood, metal, cardboard).",
      "A shadow is formed when an opaque object blocks the path of light.",
      "Three things needed for shadow formation: a light source, an opaque object, and a screen.",
      "Shadows are always dark regardless of the colour of the object.",
      "An image in a plane mirror is erect, same size as the object, and laterally inverted."
