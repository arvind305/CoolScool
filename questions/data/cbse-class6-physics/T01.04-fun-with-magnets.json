    "text": "A magnet is an object that attracts materials made of iron, nickel, and cobalt. Magnets were first discovered as natural rocks called magnetite or lodestone. Every magnet has two poles — a North pole and a South pole. Like poles repel each other and unlike poles attract each other. A freely suspended magnet always points in the north-south direction, which is the principle behind a magnetic compass. Magnets can be made artificially by rubbing a piece of iron with a magnet or by using electricity.",

      "Magnetite (lodestone) is a naturally occurring magnet.",
      "Artificial magnets come in different shapes: bar, horseshoe, cylindrical, ring.",

          "text": "Touch the end of one bar to the middle of the other; if there is attraction, the bar whose middle is being touched is the magnet, since a magnet's centre has weak attraction but an iron bar is attracted uniformly"
        }
      ],
      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation_correct": "A magnet has maximum attraction at its poles and almost no attraction at its centre. If you touch the end of bar A to the middle of bar B and there is strong attraction, bar B must be the ordinary iron bar (attracted uniformly). If there is weak or no attraction, bar B is the magnet (weak at centre). This difference helps identify which is the magnet.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Weight and floating do not help — both bars are identical iron. The key insight is that a magnet's centre is its weakest point. By testing attraction at the middle versus the ends, you can identify which bar is magnetised."
