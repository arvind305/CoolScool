    "text": "Numbers can be very large and we use place value systems to read and write them. In the Indian system, commas are placed after the first three digits from the right, then every two digits (lakhs, crores). In the international system, commas are placed every three digits from the right (thousands, millions). Estimation helps us quickly approximate answers by rounding numbers before computing.",

      "Rule 1: Indian system places: ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, lakhs, ten lakhs, crores",
      "Rule 2: International system places: ones, tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, hundred thousands, millions, ten millions",
      "Rule 3: 1 lakh = 100 thousand; 1 crore = 10 million",
      "Rule 4: To compare numbers, first check the number of digits — more digits means larger number; if equal digits, compare from leftmost digit",
