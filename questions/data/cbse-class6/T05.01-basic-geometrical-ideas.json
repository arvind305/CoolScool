    "text": "Geometry begins with the basic ideas of points, lines, and planes. A point has no size, a line extends infinitely in both directions, a ray starts at a point and goes infinitely in one direction, and a line segment has two endpoints. Curves can be open or closed, and closed curves like polygons have an interior, exterior, and boundary. A circle is a closed curve where every point is at the same distance from the centre.",
    "rules": [
      "Rule 1: A line has no endpoints and extends infinitely; a ray has one endpoint; a line segment has two endpoints",
      "Rule 2: Intersecting lines meet at a point; parallel lines never meet; perpendicular lines meet at 90 degrees",
      "Rule 3: A polygon is a closed figure made of line segments — sides meet at vertices",
      "Rule 4: Number of diagonals in an n-sided polygon = n(n-3)/2",
      "Rule 5: Circle: diameter = 2 x radius; a chord is any segment with endpoints on the circle; the longest chord is the diameter"
