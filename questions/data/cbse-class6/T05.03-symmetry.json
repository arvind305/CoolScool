    "text": "A figure has line symmetry if a line can divide it into two identical halves that are mirror images of each other. This line is called the line of symmetry (or axis of symmetry). A figure may have no line of symmetry, exactly one, or multiple lines of symmetry. A regular polygon with n sides has exactly n lines of symmetry. A circle has infinitely many lines of symmetry.",
    "rules": [
      "Rule 1: A line of symmetry divides a figure into two mirror-image halves that overlap exactly when folded along that line.",
      "Rule 2: A regular polygon with n sides has exactly n lines of symmetry (equilateral triangle = 3, square = 4, regular pentagon = 5, regular hexagon = 6).",
      "Rule 3: A rectangle has 2 lines of symmetry; an isosceles triangle has 1; a scalene triangle has 0.",
      "Rule 4: Capital English letters with vertical line symmetry include A, H, I, M, O, T, U, V, W, X, Y. Letters with horizontal line symmetry include B, C, D, E, H, I, K, O, X.",
