  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Practical geometry involves constructing geometric figures accurately using instruments such as a ruler, compass, divider, protractor, and set squares. Key constructions at this level include drawing line segments of given lengths, copying line segments, constructing perpendiculars (at a point on a line and from an external point), constructing the perpendicular bisector of a line segment, drawing angles of given measures, bisecting angles, constructing special angles (60, 90, 120 degrees) using a compass, and drawing circles of given radii.",
    "rules": [
      "Rule 1: A line segment of given length can be drawn using a ruler, or copied using a compass by transferring the opening.",
      "Rule 2: The perpendicular bisector of a line segment passes through its midpoint and is at 90 degrees to it. Every point on it is equidistant from the two endpoints.",
      "Rule 3: To construct a 60-degree angle, draw an arc from the vertex, then with the same radius draw an arc from the point where the first arc meets the ray. The intersection gives 60 degrees.",
      "Rule 4: An angle bisector divides an angle into two equal parts. Constructed by drawing arcs from both arms and connecting the vertex to the intersection.",
      "Rule 5: A circle is constructed by fixing the compass opening to the required radius and rotating it 360 degrees around the centre point."
