    "text": "Data handling is the process of collecting, organizing, and interpreting information. Data can be organized using tally marks and frequency tables to count occurrences. Pictographs use pictures or symbols to represent data, where each symbol may represent more than one unit. Bar graphs use rectangular bars of equal width to represent data, with the bar height (or length) proportional to the value. Interpreting data means reading graphs and tables to answer questions, compare values, and draw conclusions.",
    "rules": [
      "Rule 1: A tally mark uses groups of five: four vertical strokes and a diagonal stroke for the fifth (||||).",
      "Rule 2: In a pictograph, each symbol represents a fixed number of items (given by the key). Partial symbols represent proportional amounts.",
      "Rule 3: In a bar graph, all bars have equal width, gaps between bars are equal, the scale must be uniform, and the height of each bar represents the value.",
      "Rule 4: Data can be read directly from a graph (reading values) or interpreted (comparing, finding totals, differences, highest, lowest).",
      "Rule 5: The scale of a bar graph should be chosen so that all values can be represented clearly — usually the largest value determines the scale."
