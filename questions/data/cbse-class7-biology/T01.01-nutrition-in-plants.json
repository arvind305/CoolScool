    "text": "Plants are called autotrophs because they can make their own food through the process of photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, green plants use carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll to produce glucose (food) and oxygen. The green pigment chlorophyll, found in chloroplasts of leaf cells, captures sunlight energy. Leaves have tiny pores called stomata on their surface through which carbon dioxide enters and oxygen exits. Not all plants are autotrophic. Some plants obtain food from other organisms. Cuscuta (amarbel) is a parasitic plant that lives on a host. Pitcher plant and Venus flytrap are insectivorous plants that trap and digest insects. Fungi like mushrooms are saprotrophs that feed on dead and decaying matter. Lichens represent a symbiotic relationship between algae and fungi. Rhizobium bacteria in the root nodules of leguminous plants fix atmospheric nitrogen into the soil.",

      "correct_answer": "Cuscuta",
      "explanation_correct": "Cuscuta (also known as amarbel or dodder) is a parasitic plant that lacks chlorophyll. It twines around a host plant and penetrates it using special root-like structures called haustoria to absorb water and nutrients.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'Cuscuta'. Also known as amarbel, this parasitic plant cannot perform photosynthesis. It depends entirely on the host plant for nutrition, using haustoria to extract water and food."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Starch cannot be produced (A) because CO2 has been removed by KOH. Leaves don't turn green from iodine (C) or red (D). Without CO2, photosynthesis cannot occur, so no starch is formed (B)."
