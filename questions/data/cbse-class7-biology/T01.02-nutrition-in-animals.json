    "text": "Animals cannot make their own food and are called heterotrophs. They depend on plants or other animals for nutrition. The process of nutrition in animals involves five steps: ingestion (taking in food), digestion (breaking down complex food into simpler forms), absorption (taking in digested food into blood), assimilation (using absorbed food for energy and growth), and egestion (removing undigested waste). The human digestive system consists of the alimentary canal and associated glands. Food enters through the mouth where saliva containing salivary amylase begins the digestion of starch. The food passes through the oesophagus to the stomach where hydrochloric acid and pepsin act on proteins. In the small intestine, bile from the liver, pancreatic juice, and intestinal juice complete digestion. The inner wall of the small intestine has finger-like projections called villi that absorb nutrients. The large intestine absorbs water, and undigested waste is expelled. Ruminants like cows have a four-chambered stomach and chew cud. Amoeba engulfs food using pseudopodia and digests it in a food vacuole.",
