    "text": "Weather is the day-to-day condition of the atmosphere at a particular place and time, described by elements such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and wind speed. Climate is the average weather pattern of a place taken over a long period of about 25 years or more. While weather changes daily, climate remains fairly constant. Animals have special features called adaptations that help them survive in their particular climate. In polar regions, where temperatures drop below -37 degrees Celsius, animals like polar bears have thick white fur for camouflage and insulation, a layer of fat under the skin, and wide paws for walking on snow. Penguins have a streamlined body and huddle together for warmth. In tropical rainforests, which are hot and humid with heavy rainfall, animals have adapted in different ways. Monkeys have long tails for gripping branches, toucans have large beaks, and many animals use camouflage. The red-eyed frog has bright colours to warn predators, and elephants have large ears to regulate body temperature.",
