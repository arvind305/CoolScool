  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Respiration is the process by which organisms break down food (glucose) to release energy needed for life activities. It should not be confused with breathing, which is simply the process of inhaling and exhaling air. Respiration occurs in two types: aerobic respiration (in the presence of oxygen) where glucose is broken down into carbon dioxide, water, and a large amount of energy; and anaerobic respiration (without oxygen) where glucose is broken down into alcohol or lactic acid and a small amount of energy. Yeast performs anaerobic respiration to produce alcohol (fermentation). In humans, during heavy exercise, muscles may respire anaerobically producing lactic acid, which causes muscle cramps. The human respiratory system consists of nostrils, nasal cavity, trachea (windpipe), bronchi, lungs, and diaphragm. During inhalation, the diaphragm moves down and ribs move up, expanding the chest cavity to draw air in. During exhalation, the reverse happens. Different animals breathe differently: earthworms through moist skin, fish through gills, insects through spiracles, and frogs through both lungs and moist skin.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Breathing does not cool lungs (A), reduce nitrogen (C), or slow heart rate (D). Rapid breathing increases O2 supply and CO2 removal (B) to meet the increased energy demands during exercise."

      "explanation_correct": "Making wine uses yeast which performs anaerobic respiration (fermentation), converting glucose into alcohol and CO2 without oxygen. The other activities rely on normal aerobic respiration.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Walking (A), normal breathing (C), and reading (D) all involve aerobic respiration. Wine-making (B) uses yeast fermentation, which is anaerobic respiration."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Earthworms breathe through their moist skin. Oxygen from the air dissolves in the moisture on their skin and diffuses in. If the skin dries out, oxygen cannot dissolve and gas exchange stops, causing suffocation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "While earthworms need moisture for movement, the critical reason for death is respiratory failure. Without a moist skin surface, oxygen cannot dissolve and enter the body (B), and the earthworm suffocates."
