    "text": "In the human body, the circulatory system transports substances to all parts. Blood is a fluid connective tissue consisting of plasma (liquid part), red blood cells (RBCs containing haemoglobin for carrying oxygen), white blood cells (WBCs for fighting infections), and platelets (for blood clotting). Blood flows through blood vessels: arteries carry oxygenated blood away from the heart, veins carry deoxygenated blood towards the heart, and capillaries are thin-walled vessels where exchange of substances occurs. The heart is a muscular organ with four chambers (two atria and two ventricles) that pumps blood throughout the body. The heartbeat can be felt as a pulse, and a stethoscope is used to hear it. The normal heart rate is about 72 beats per minute. The excretory system removes waste products: kidneys filter blood to produce urine, which passes through ureters to the urinary bladder and is expelled through the urethra. Dialysis is the artificial filtering of blood when kidneys fail. In plants, xylem transports water and minerals from roots to leaves, while phloem transports food from leaves to other parts. Transpiration (loss of water from leaf stomata) creates a suction force that helps pull water upward.",
