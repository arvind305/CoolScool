  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Reproduction is the biological process by which organisms produce new individuals of their own kind. Plants reproduce through two main modes: asexual reproduction (involving a single parent, no fusion of gametes) and sexual reproduction (involving two parents, fusion of male and female gametes). Asexual reproduction methods include vegetative propagation (new plants grow from parts like stems, roots, or leaves), budding (a small outgrowth develops into a new organism, as in yeast), fragmentation (organism breaks into fragments, each growing into a new individual, as in Spirogyra), and spore formation (spores are released that grow into new plants, as in ferns and mushrooms). In sexual reproduction, flowers are the reproductive organs. A typical flower has four parts: sepals, petals, stamens (male part with anther and filament), and pistil (female part with stigma, style, and ovary). Pollination is the transfer of pollen from anther to stigma - self-pollination (same flower or same plant) and cross-pollination (different plant, by wind, water, insects, or animals). After pollination, fertilisation occurs when the male gamete fuses with the female gamete in the ovule. The ovule develops into a seed and the ovary into a fruit. Seeds are dispersed by wind, water, animals, and explosive mechanisms.",
    "rules": [
      "Asexual reproduction involves one parent; sexual reproduction involves two gametes.",
      "Vegetative propagation: new plants from stems (rose, sugarcane), leaves (bryophyllum), roots (dahlia).",
      "Budding: outgrowth develops into new organism (yeast, hydra).",
      "Fragmentation: organism breaks into pieces, each growing into a new individual (Spirogyra).",
      "Spore formation: microscopic spores germinate into new organisms (ferns, mushrooms).",
      "Flower parts: sepals (protect bud), petals (attract pollinators), stamens (male), pistil (female).",
      "Stamen = anther + filament; Pistil = stigma + style + ovary.",
      "Self-pollination: pollen transferred within the same flower or plant; Cross-pollination: between different plants.",
      "Fertilisation: fusion of male and female gametes inside the ovule.",
      "After fertilisation: ovule becomes seed, ovary becomes fruit. Seeds are dispersed by wind, water, animals, explosion."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'dispersal'. Seed dispersal is essential to prevent overcrowding, reduce competition, and help plants colonise new areas for the survival of the species."
