    "text": "Forests are a complex ecosystem with a vast diversity of plants and animals that are interdependent. A forest has different layers: the canopy (formed by the crowns of tall trees), the understory (shorter trees and shrubs below the canopy), and the forest floor (ground level covered with dead leaves and fallen branches). Forests play vital roles in maintaining ecological balance. They purify the air by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen during photosynthesis. They help maintain the water cycle by causing rainfall through transpiration. They prevent soil erosion and floods by holding the soil with their roots. Forests are home to a rich biodiversity of plants, animals, and microorganisms. In a forest ecosystem, there are food chains and food webs. Producers (green plants) make food, consumers (herbivores, carnivores, omnivores) eat other organisms, and decomposers (fungi, bacteria) break down dead matter and recycle nutrients into the soil. Deforestation (cutting down forests) causes soil erosion, floods, loss of biodiversity, and contributes to global warming. Conservation of forests through afforestation and sustainable practices is essential for the survival of all living beings.",
