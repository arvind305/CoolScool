    "text": "Acids are substances that taste sour and turn blue litmus paper red. Bases are substances that taste bitter, feel soapy, and turn red litmus paper blue. Indicators are substances that change colour when added to acidic or basic solutions. Natural indicators include litmus, turmeric, and china rose. When an acid reacts with a base, a neutralisation reaction takes place forming salt and water. This reaction is used in everyday life, such as antacids neutralising excess stomach acid, and farmers adding lime to acidic soil. Neutral substances like water and common salt are neither acidic nor basic.",
