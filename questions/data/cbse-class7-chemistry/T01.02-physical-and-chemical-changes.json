    "text": "Changes around us can be classified as physical changes or chemical changes. In a physical change, no new substance is formed and the change is usually reversible. Examples include melting of ice, dissolving sugar in water, and tearing paper. In a chemical change, one or more new substances are formed and the change is generally irreversible. Signs of a chemical change include colour change, gas evolution, change in temperature, and formation of a precipitate. Rusting of iron is an important chemical change where iron reacts with oxygen and water to form iron oxide (rust). Rusting can be prevented by painting, oiling, greasing, galvanisation, or making alloys. Crystallisation is a physical change in which crystals of a pure substance are formed from its solution.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "They are not both physical (A) or both chemical (B). Boiling is physical and charring is chemical, not the reverse (D). Experiment 1 is reversible (steam condenses back) while Experiment 2 is irreversible."
