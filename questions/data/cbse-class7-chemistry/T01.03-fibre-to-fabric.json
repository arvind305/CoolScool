    "text": "Animal fibres include wool and silk. Wool is obtained from the fleece (hair) of sheep, goats, yaks, camels, and llamas. The processing of wool involves shearing, scouring, sorting, dyeing, spinning, and weaving. Workers who sort wool may contract sorter's disease caused by anthrax bacteria present in the fleece. Silk is obtained from the cocoon of the silk moth. The rearing of silkworms for obtaining silk is called sericulture. The life cycle of a silk moth includes egg, larva (silkworm/caterpillar), pupa (cocoon), and adult moth. The process of taking out silk fibres from the cocoon is called reeling. Different types of silk include mulberry silk, tassar silk, eri silk, and mooga silk.",
