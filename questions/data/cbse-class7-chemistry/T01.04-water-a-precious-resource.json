    "text": "Water is essential for life and covers about 71% of Earth's surface. However, most of this is salt water in oceans. Only about 3% is freshwater, and of that, most is locked in ice caps and glaciers. Less than 1% of freshwater is available for human use. The water cycle — involving evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection — continuously circulates water on Earth. Groundwater is water found below the Earth's surface, and the upper level of this underground water is called the water table. The water table is affected by rainfall, human usage, and deforestation. Water conservation is crucial and can be achieved through rainwater harvesting, drip irrigation, fixing leaky taps, and reusing water. Traditional water harvesting systems like bawris (stepwells) have been used in India for centuries.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Rocks do not add cleaning chemicals (A). Lack of sunlight (C) does not purify water. Underground water is not boiled (D). The natural filtration through soil and rock layers (B) is what cleans the water."

      "explanation_correct": "The water table dropping from 5m to 15m indicates severe depletion. Population growth leads to more water demand, industrialisation uses large amounts of water, and reduced green cover decreases groundwater recharge — all contributing to this decline.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Increased trees and rainfall (A) would raise the water table. Better conservation (C) would maintain or raise it. Dams and reservoirs (D) would help store water. Only population growth, industrialisation, and deforestation (B) would cause such a significant decline."
