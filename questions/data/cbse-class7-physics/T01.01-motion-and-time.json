    "text": "Motion is the change in position of an object with respect to time. Objects can undergo different types of motion such as rectilinear (straight line), circular, periodic (repeating at regular intervals), and oscillatory (back and forth about a mean position). Speed measures how fast an object moves and is calculated as the distance covered divided by the time taken. The SI unit of speed is metre per second (m/s). Uniform motion means the object covers equal distances in equal intervals of time, while non-uniform motion means unequal distances in equal intervals. Time is measured using clocks and watches; the SI unit of time is the second. A simple pendulum can be used to measure time because it takes the same time for each oscillation (its time period). Distance-time graphs help us visualize and compare the motion of objects.",
