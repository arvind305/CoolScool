    "text": "Electric current is the flow of electric charge (electrons) through a conductor. When a circuit is complete, current flows from the positive terminal of the cell through the external circuit to the negative terminal. Electric current has two main effects studied at this level: the heating effect and the magnetic effect. The heating effect occurs because current flowing through a wire generates heat; this principle is used in devices like electric heaters, irons, toasters, and filament bulbs. An electric fuse is a safety device that uses the heating effect - it melts and breaks the circuit when excess current flows. The magnetic effect of current means a wire carrying current behaves like a magnet. An electromagnet is a coil of wire wound around an iron core that becomes magnetic when current flows through it. Electromagnets are used in electric bells, cranes, and many other devices.",

      "explanation_correct": "When current flows through a wire, it creates a magnetic field around the wire. This magnetic field affects the compass needle and causes it to deflect. This is the classic demonstration of the magnetic effect of electric current, first observed by Oersted.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement is true. This was Oersted's famous observation: a compass needle deflects near a current-carrying wire because the current produces a magnetic field."
