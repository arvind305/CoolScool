    "text": "Light is a form of energy that enables us to see objects. Light travels in straight lines, which is called rectilinear propagation. When light falls on a smooth, shiny surface like a mirror, it bounces back. This bouncing back of light is called reflection. The laws of reflection state that (1) the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, and (2) the incident ray, reflected ray, and normal all lie in the same plane. A plane mirror forms an image that is virtual, erect, same size as the object, and laterally inverted. The image is as far behind the mirror as the object is in front. Concave mirrors (curved inward) converge light and are used in torches, headlights, and by dentists. Convex mirrors (curved outward) diverge light and are used as rear-view mirrors. White light is composed of seven colours (VIBGYOR), which can be separated by a prism. This splitting of white light is called dispersion. A rainbow is a natural example of dispersion.",
