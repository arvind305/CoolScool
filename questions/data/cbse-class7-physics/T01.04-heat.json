    "text": "Heat is a form of energy that flows from a hotter object to a cooler object. Temperature is the measure of the degree of hotness or coldness of a body. We use thermometers to measure temperature accurately. A clinical thermometer is used to measure body temperature and has a range of 35 degrees C to 42 degrees C with a kink that prevents mercury from falling back. A laboratory thermometer has a range of -10 degrees C to 110 degrees C and is used for measuring temperatures in experiments. Heat can be transferred in three ways: conduction (through solids, without the material moving), convection (through liquids and gases, with the material moving), and radiation (through empty space, without any medium). Materials that conduct heat easily are called conductors (metals like iron, copper, aluminium), and those that do not are called insulators (wood, plastic, air, wool). Woollen clothes keep us warm because wool traps air, which is a poor conductor of heat. Dark-coloured objects absorb more heat than light-coloured objects.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Metal is a good conductor of heat, so the heat from the fire travels quickly through the metal rod and the other end becomes hot sooner. Wood is a poor conductor, so the wooden rod transfers heat much more slowly.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Metal conducts heat much faster than wood. The metal rod's far end will become hot quickly, while the wooden rod's far end will remain relatively cool for a long time."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Heat and temperature are different concepts. Heat is energy transferred (measured in Joules), while temperature measures hotness/coldness (measured in degrees). They are related but not the same."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answers are '42' and 'fever'. The clinical thermometer measures up to 42 degrees C, and body temperature above the normal 37 degrees C indicates fever."
