    "text": "A triangle is a three-sided polygon. The sum of all angles of a triangle is 180 degrees (angle sum property). An exterior angle of a triangle equals the sum of the two interior opposite angles. The sum of any two sides of a triangle is always greater than the third side (triangle inequality). In a right-angled triangle, the Pythagoras theorem states that the square of the hypotenuse equals the sum of squares of the other two sides.",
