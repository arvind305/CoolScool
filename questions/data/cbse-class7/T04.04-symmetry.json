    "text": "Symmetry means a balanced and proportionate arrangement. A figure has line symmetry if it can be folded along a line so that the two halves match exactly. A regular polygon with n sides has n lines of symmetry. A figure has rotational symmetry if it looks the same after rotation by an angle less than 360 degrees. The order of rotational symmetry is the number of times a figure matches itself during a full 360-degree rotation.",
    "rules": [
      "Line of symmetry: divides a figure into two mirror-image halves",
      "A regular polygon with n sides has n lines of symmetry",
      "Order of rotational symmetry = number of positions where figure looks the same in 360 degrees",
      "Angle of rotation = 360 / order of rotational symmetry",
      "Every figure with line symmetry has at least order 1 rotational symmetry",
      "A figure may have rotational symmetry without having line symmetry (e.g., parallelogram)"
