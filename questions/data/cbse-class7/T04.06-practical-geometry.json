    "text": "Practical geometry involves constructing triangles using ruler, compass, and protractor given specific measurements. A triangle can be constructed when: (1) SSS — three sides are given, (2) SAS — two sides and the included angle are given, (3) ASA — two angles and the included side are given, (4) RHS — the hypotenuse and one side of a right-angled triangle are given. Each construction method follows a specific sequence of steps.",
    "rules": ["SSS: Draw base, then arcs from both endpoints to locate third vertex","SAS: Draw one side, construct the given angle at one end, mark the other side's length","ASA: Draw the included side, construct both angles at its endpoints; intersection gives third vertex","RHS: Draw one leg, construct right angle, draw arc with radius = hypotenuse to find third vertex","A triangle cannot be constructed if the sum of any two sides is not greater than the third side","The sum of angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees"]
