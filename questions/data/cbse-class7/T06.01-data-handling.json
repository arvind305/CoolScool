    "text": "Data handling involves collecting, organising, and interpreting data. The arithmetic mean is the sum of observations divided by the number of observations. The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values. The median is the middle value when data is arranged in order. The mode is the most frequently occurring value. Bar graphs and double bar graphs are used to represent and compare data visually. Probability describes the chance of an event occurring; outcomes can be certain, impossible, or equally likely.",
    "rules": ["Mean = Sum of all observations / Number of observations","Range = Highest value - Lowest value","Median = Middle value in ordered data (for odd count); average of two middle values (for even count)","Mode = Most frequently occurring observation","In a bar graph, bars have equal widths and uniform gaps","Double bar graphs compare two sets of data side by side","Probability of an event = Number of favourable outcomes / Total number of outcomes","Probability ranges from 0 (impossible) to 1 (certain)"]
