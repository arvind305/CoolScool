    "text": "Agriculture is the science of cultivating plants and rearing animals for food, fibre, and other products. Crops are plants grown on a large scale for food or commercial use. Kharif crops are sown in the rainy season (June-October) and include paddy, maize, soybean, and cotton. Rabi crops are sown in the winter season (October-March) and include wheat, gram, peas, and mustard. Crop production involves several steps: preparation of soil (ploughing, levelling), sowing seeds at proper depth and spacing, adding manure or fertilisers, irrigation, protecting crops from weeds and pests, and finally harvesting and storage. Manure is an organic substance obtained from decomposition of plant and animal waste, while fertilisers are chemical substances manufactured in factories. Proper storage of harvested grains is essential to protect them from moisture and pests.",

      "Good quality seeds should be sown at correct depth and spacing.",
      "Manure is organic, made from decomposed plant and animal waste.",
      "Fertilisers are chemical substances (e.g., urea, NPK) made in factories.",
      "Irrigation is the supply of water to crops at appropriate intervals.",
      "Weeding is the removal of unwanted plants (weeds) from the field.",
      "Harvesting is cutting of mature crop; threshing separates grain from chaff.",
