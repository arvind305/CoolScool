    "text": "Microorganisms are tiny living organisms that cannot be seen with the naked eye and require a microscope for observation. They include bacteria, fungi, protozoa, algae, and viruses. Microorganisms are found everywhere: in soil, water, air, and even inside the bodies of other organisms. Many microorganisms are useful to us — bacteria like Lactobacillus help in making curd, yeast is used in baking bread and brewing alcohol, and fungi like Penicillium produce the antibiotic penicillin. Vaccines prepared from weakened or killed microorganisms protect us from diseases. In agriculture, Rhizobium bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen in the root nodules of leguminous plants. However, some microorganisms cause diseases in humans (e.g., tuberculosis, malaria), animals, and plants. Food spoilage is also caused by microorganisms, and preservation methods like drying, salting, pasteurisation, and refrigeration help prevent this.",
    "rules": [
      "Microorganisms are classified into five major groups: bacteria, fungi, protozoa, algae, and viruses.",
      "Viruses are considered to be on the borderline of living and non-living; they reproduce only inside a host cell.",
      "Lactobacillus bacteria convert milk into curd.",
      "Yeast is used in baking (CO2 makes dough rise) and in producing alcohol (fermentation).",
      "Antibiotics (e.g., penicillin) are medicines produced from bacteria or fungi that kill or stop the growth of disease-causing microorganisms.",
      "Vaccines contain weakened or killed pathogens that stimulate the body to produce antibodies.",
      "Rhizobium bacteria in root nodules of legumes fix atmospheric nitrogen into the soil.",
      "Communicable diseases spread from an infected person to a healthy person through air, water, food, or direct contact.",
      "Food preservation methods include pasteurisation, drying, salting, adding sugar, refrigeration, and use of preservatives.",
      "The nitrogen cycle involves nitrogen fixation, nitrification, and denitrification by various microorganisms."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Drying or dehydration preserves food by removing water. Since microorganisms need moisture to grow, removing water from food prevents their growth and spoilage. Sun-drying of fish, meat, and vegetables is a traditional example.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Refrigeration slows microbial growth by lowering temperature. Adding oil creates an airtight barrier. Vacuum sealing removes air. Drying specifically works by removing the moisture that microorganisms need to survive."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Ringworm is misleadingly named. It is caused by fungi (dermatophytes), not by any worm, bacteria, or virus. The ring-shaped rash it produces on the skin gave it its common name."
