    "text": "Microorganisms are tiny living organisms that cannot be seen with the naked eye and require a microscope for observation. They include bacteria, fungi, protozoa, algae, and viruses. Microorganisms are found everywhere: in soil, water, air, and even inside the bodies of other organisms. Many microorganisms are useful to us — bacteria like Lactobacillus help in making curd, yeast is used in baking bread and brewing alcohol, and fungi like Penicillium produce the antibiotic penicillin. Vaccines prepared from weakened or killed microorganisms protect us from diseases. In agriculture, Rhizobium bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen in the root nodules of leguminous plants. However, some microorganisms cause diseases in humans (e.g., tuberculosis, malaria), animals, and plants. Food spoilage is also caused by microorganisms, and preservation methods like drying, salting, pasteurisation, and refrigeration help prevent this.",
    "rules": [
      "Microorganisms are classified into five major groups: bacteria, fungi, protozoa, algae, and viruses.",
      "Viruses are considered to be on the borderline of living and non-living; they reproduce only inside a host cell.",
      "Lactobacillus bacteria convert milk into curd.",
      "Yeast is used in baking (CO2 makes dough rise) and in producing alcohol (fermentation).",
      "Antibiotics (e.g., penicillin) are medicines produced from bacteria or fungi that kill or stop the growth of disease-causing microorganisms.",
      "Vaccines contain weakened or killed pathogens that stimulate the body to produce antibodies.",
      "Rhizobium bacteria in root nodules of legumes fix atmospheric nitrogen into the soil.",
      "Communicable diseases spread from an infected person to a healthy person through air, water, food, or direct contact.",
      "Food preservation methods include pasteurisation, drying, salting, adding sugar, refrigeration, and use of preservatives.",
      "The nitrogen cycle involves nitrogen fixation, nitrification, and denitrification by various microorganisms."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Viruses are on the borderline because they show characteristics of living things (reproduction, specific host attack) only when inside a host cell. Outside a host, they exist as inactive crystalline particles with no metabolic activity. Since they cannot carry out life processes independently, they cannot be classified as fully living organisms.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Viruses are extremely small, not large. They are made of protein and nucleic acid, not water. They have a very different structure from bacteria. The actual reason for their borderline classification is their dependence on a host cell for all life-like activities, especially reproduction."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Leguminous plants host Rhizobium bacteria in their root nodules. These bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into ammonia and nitrates — forms of nitrogen that plants can absorb from the soil. This biological nitrogen fixation enriches the soil with nitrogen naturally, improving its fertility for subsequent crops.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Legume roots do not dissolve rocks or absorb harmful chemicals in a significant way. Leaves release oxygen into the air, not the soil. The specific reason legumes improve soil fertility is the symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria that fix atmospheric nitrogen into usable forms."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Pasteurisation involves heating milk to about 70°C for 15-30 seconds and then cooling it rapidly. This controlled process is sufficient to kill most harmful microorganisms while minimising the loss of nutrients and the change in flavour. Prolonged boiling at higher temperatures can destroy heat-sensitive vitamins and alter the taste of milk.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Pasteurisation requires specialised equipment, so it is not necessarily cheaper. Prolonged boiling does not make milk poisonous, though it can reduce nutritional value. Pasteurisation does not add vitamins. The reason it is preferred is that it effectively kills pathogens while better preserving the milk's original taste and nutrients."
