    "text": "Deforestation is the clearing of forests on a large scale for purposes such as agriculture, building houses, making furniture, and constructing dams. It leads to serious consequences including global warming (increased CO2 in the atmosphere), drought, floods, soil erosion, and loss of biodiversity. Biodiversity refers to the variety of living organisms found in a particular area. Flora refers to the plants, and fauna refers to the animals of a region. To protect biodiversity, various conservation measures have been established: wildlife sanctuaries (where hunting is prohibited), national parks (where no human activity is allowed), and biosphere reserves (large protected areas for conservation of biodiversity). Endemic species are those found exclusively in a particular region. The Red Data Book lists endangered species. Reforestation (replanting trees in deforested areas) and afforestation (planting trees in new areas) are important strategies to counter the effects of deforestation.",
