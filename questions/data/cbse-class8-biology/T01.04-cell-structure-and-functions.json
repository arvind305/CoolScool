    "text": "The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of all living organisms. Robert Hooke first observed cells in 1665 using a simple microscope to examine a thin slice of cork. All organisms are made up of cells — some are unicellular (single-celled) like Amoeba and Paramecium, while others are multicellular (many-celled) like humans and plants. A typical cell consists of a cell membrane (plasma membrane) that encloses the cytoplasm and the nucleus. The nucleus contains chromosomes made of DNA, which carry genes — the units of inheritance. Plant cells have a cell wall outside the cell membrane and large central vacuoles, while animal cells lack a cell wall and have smaller vacuoles. Important cell organelles include mitochondria (energy production), chloroplasts (photosynthesis in plant cells), endoplasmic reticulum (protein and lipid synthesis), and Golgi apparatus (packaging and transport). In multicellular organisms, cells are organized into tissues, organs, organ systems, and finally the complete organism.",
