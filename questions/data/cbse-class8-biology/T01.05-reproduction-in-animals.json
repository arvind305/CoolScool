    "text": "Reproduction is the biological process by which organisms produce offspring of their own kind. There are two main modes of reproduction: sexual and asexual. Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of male gametes (sperm) and female gametes (ova/eggs) to form a zygote. In humans, the male reproductive organs (testes) produce sperms, and the female reproductive organs (ovaries) produce ova. When a sperm fuses with an ovum, fertilisation occurs, forming a zygote that develops into an embryo and then a foetus. Fertilisation can be internal (inside the body, as in humans, cows, dogs) or external (outside the body, as in frogs and fish). Animals that give birth to live young are viviparous, while those that lay eggs are oviparous. Asexual reproduction does not involve gametes — organisms reproduce from a single parent. Budding (in Hydra) and binary fission (in Amoeba) are common methods of asexual reproduction.",
