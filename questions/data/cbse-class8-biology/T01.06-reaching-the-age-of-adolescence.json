    "text": "Adolescence is the period of life between the ages of about 11 and 18-19 years, during which the body undergoes significant changes leading to reproductive maturity. The onset of puberty marks the beginning of adolescence. During puberty, the body experiences several changes: increase in height, changes in body shape, voice changes (especially in boys), development of reproductive organs, and the appearance of secondary sexual characters. These changes are controlled by hormones — chemical substances secreted by endocrine glands. The pituitary gland (master gland) signals the testes to produce testosterone in boys and the ovaries to produce estrogen in girls. Other endocrine glands include the thyroid (controls metabolism), adrenal glands (produce adrenaline for emergencies), and pancreas (produces insulin for blood sugar regulation). Sex of a baby is determined by the sex chromosomes: XX for female and XY for male. Maintaining good health during adolescence requires a balanced diet, personal hygiene, regular physical exercise, and saying no to drugs.",

      "explanation_correct": "Growth hormone is produced by the pituitary gland and is essential for proper growth and development. Its deficiency leads to stunted growth (dwarfism), even if nutrition is adequate.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Insulin controls blood sugar. Adrenaline handles stress. Testosterone affects male characteristics. Growth hormone from the pituitary gland is specifically responsible for body growth, and its deficiency causes reduced height."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "During adolescence, hormonal changes increase the activity of sweat and oil (sebaceous) glands. This can lead to increased perspiration, body odour, and acne. Regular bathing and personal hygiene help manage these changes.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Hygiene is always important, not just during adolescence. The specific reason it becomes more critical during this period is the increased activity of sweat and oil glands due to hormonal changes, which can cause skin issues."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Endocrine glands are not ductless because of small or blocked ducts — they simply do not have ducts at all. They produce secretions (hormones) and release them directly into the blood for transport."
