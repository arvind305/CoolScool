    "text": "Synthetic fibres are man-made fibres prepared by chemical processing of petrochemicals. They are polymers, which are large molecules made up of many repeating small units called monomers. Common synthetic fibres include rayon (made from wood pulp, also called artificial silk), nylon (the first fully synthetic fibre, very strong and elastic), polyester (wrinkle-resistant, used widely in clothing — PET is a popular form), and acrylic (resembles wool, lightweight and warm). Plastics are also polymers that can be moulded into desired shapes. They are classified into thermoplastics (which can be softened and remoulded on heating, like PVC and polythene) and thermosetting plastics (which cannot be remoulded once set, like bakelite and melamine). While synthetic materials have many advantages such as durability and low cost, they are mostly non-biodegradable and cause environmental pollution. The 4R principle — Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, Recover — helps manage plastic waste.",

Rayon is the fibre called artificial silk because it resembles silk in texture and appearance, and is made from natural cellulose (wood pulp) through chemical processing."

      "explanation_correct": "The fibre is rayon. It is not classified as fully synthetic because its raw material is natural cellulose obtained from wood pulp.

      "explanation_incorrect": "Nylon is made from chemicals, not wood pulp. Polyester is made from petroleum derivatives. Acrylic resembles wool, not silk. Rayon is the correct answer because it is made from natural wood pulp (cellulose) processed chemically, making it semi-synthetic rather than fully synthetic."

      "explanation_correct": "Polyester does not wrinkle easily and retains its shape, making it ideal for dress materials that need to look neat and well-pressed. It is also durable and quick-drying, adding to its suitability for clothing.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Polyester is not biodegradable, does not absorb much moisture, and is lightweight — not heavy. Its wrinkle-resistance and shape-retention are the key properties that make it popular for dress materials and formal clothing."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct 4R principle is Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, and Recover. This is the standard environmental guideline for managing waste, especially non-biodegradable waste like plastics."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Synthetic fibres are not biodegradable (a disadvantage), do not absorb sweat well, and are generally less breathable than natural fibres. Their advantages lie in durability, wrinkle-resistance, easy maintenance, and resistance to insects and moisture."
