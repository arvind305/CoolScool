    "text": "Elements can be broadly classified into metals and non-metals based on their physical and chemical properties. Metals are typically lustrous (shiny), malleable (can be beaten into sheets), ductile (can be drawn into wires), good conductors of heat and electricity, and sonorous (produce a ringing sound when struck). Non-metals are generally brittle, non-lustrous, poor conductors, and non-sonorous. Chemically, metals react with oxygen to form basic oxides, react with acids to produce hydrogen gas, and can displace less reactive metals from their salt solutions. Non-metals react with oxygen to form acidic or neutral oxides. The reactivity series arranges metals in order of their reactivity, with potassium and sodium being the most reactive and gold and platinum being the least reactive. A more reactive metal can displace a less reactive metal from its salt solution in a displacement reaction.",
