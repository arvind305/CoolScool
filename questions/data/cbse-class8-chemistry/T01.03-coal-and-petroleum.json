    "text": "Natural resources can be classified as exhaustible (limited in nature, will run out) and inexhaustible (unlimited, will not run out). Coal, petroleum, and natural gas are exhaustible resources called fossil fuels because they were formed from the remains of dead organisms over millions of years. Coal was formed by the carbonisation of dead vegetation buried deep under the earth. It exists in types of increasing carbon content: peat, lignite, bituminous, and anthracite. When coal is processed in the absence of air (destructive distillation), it yields coke, coal tar, and coal gas. Petroleum (meaning 'rock oil') was formed from dead marine organisms compressed under sedimentary rocks. It is refined by fractional distillation to yield various fractions including LPG, petrol, diesel, kerosene, lubricating oil, paraffin wax, and bitumen. Natural gas, mainly methane, is found above petroleum deposits and is used as CNG (Compressed Natural Gas) — a cleaner fuel. Conservation of these resources is essential since they take millions of years to form.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Burning coal in air is combustion, not destructive distillation. The key difference is that destructive distillation is done in the absence of air, which prevents combustion and instead decomposes coal into coke, coal tar, and coal gas."
