    "text": "Combustion is a chemical process in which a substance (fuel) reacts with oxygen to produce heat and light. Three conditions are necessary for combustion: the presence of a combustible substance (fuel), air (oxygen), and heating to the ignition temperature. The ignition temperature is the minimum temperature at which a substance catches fire. Substances with low ignition temperatures, such as petrol, alcohol, and LPG, are called inflammable substances. There are different types of combustion: rapid combustion (occurs quickly with external heat, like burning of gas), spontaneous combustion (occurs on its own without external heat, like forest fires), and explosion (sudden reaction with large amounts of gas, heat, light, and sound). A candle flame has three zones: the dark zone (innermost, unburnt wax vapours, least hot), the luminous zone (middle, partial combustion, yellow, moderately hot), and the non-luminous zone (outermost, complete combustion, blue, hottest). Calorific value is the amount of heat produced per unit mass of a fuel, measured in kJ/kg. An ideal fuel has a high calorific value, is easily available, burns without pollution, and is easy to store and transport.",
    "rules": [
      "Combustion requires: fuel + oxygen (air) + ignition temperature.",
      "Ignition temperature is the minimum temperature at which a substance catches fire.",
      "Inflammable substances have very low ignition temperatures (e.g., petrol, LPG, alcohol).",
      "Rapid combustion: burns quickly when heated (e.g., gas stove).",
      "Spontaneous combustion: catches fire without external heating (e.g., phosphorus in air).",
      "Explosion: sudden reaction producing gas, heat, light, and sound (e.g., firecrackers).",
      "Fire triangle: fuel, heat, and oxygen — remove any one to extinguish fire.",
      "Candle flame zones: dark (innermost, coolest), luminous (middle, yellow), non-luminous (outermost, hottest, blue).",
      "Calorific value = heat produced per unit mass of fuel (kJ/kg).",
