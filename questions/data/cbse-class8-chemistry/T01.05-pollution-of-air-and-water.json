    "text": "Air pollution occurs when harmful substances (pollutants) are added to the atmosphere in quantities that damage the environment and human health. Major air pollutants include carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter, and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Sources include vehicles, factories, power plants, and burning of fossil fuels. Acid rain forms when SO2 and NO2 dissolve in rainwater, forming sulphuric and nitric acids. It damages monuments (like the Taj Mahal — called marble cancer), kills aquatic life, and harms vegetation. Global warming is caused by increased greenhouse gases (especially CO2) trapping heat in the atmosphere. CFCs deplete the ozone layer that protects us from harmful ultraviolet radiation. Water pollution occurs when harmful substances contaminate water bodies. Pollutants include sewage, industrial waste, pesticides, and fertilisers. Eutrophication happens when excess nutrients cause algal blooms that deplete oxygen, killing aquatic life. Water purification methods include filtration, chlorination, boiling, and reverse osmosis (RO). The Ganga Action Plan was launched to reduce pollution in the river Ganga. Conservation follows the three Rs: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.",
