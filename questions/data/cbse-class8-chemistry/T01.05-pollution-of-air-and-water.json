    "text": "Air pollution occurs when harmful substances (pollutants) are added to the atmosphere in quantities that damage the environment and human health. Major air pollutants include carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter, and chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). Sources include vehicles, factories, power plants, and burning of fossil fuels. Acid rain forms when SO2 and NO2 dissolve in rainwater, forming sulphuric and nitric acids. It damages monuments (like the Taj Mahal — called marble cancer), kills aquatic life, and harms vegetation. Global warming is caused by increased greenhouse gases (especially CO2) trapping heat in the atmosphere. CFCs deplete the ozone layer that protects us from harmful ultraviolet radiation. Water pollution occurs when harmful substances contaminate water bodies. Pollutants include sewage, industrial waste, pesticides, and fertilisers. Eutrophication happens when excess nutrients cause algal blooms that deplete oxygen, killing aquatic life. Water purification methods include filtration, chlorination, boiling, and reverse osmosis (RO). The Ganga Action Plan was launched to reduce pollution in the river Ganga. Conservation follows the three Rs: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle.",

Normal rain is only very slightly acidic (due to dissolved CO2) and does not cause significant chemical damage to marble structures.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Normal rain does not corrode marble because it lacks strong acids. Acid rain, containing sulphuric and nitric acids from SO2 and NOx pollution, reacts aggressively with calcium carbonate in marble. The Taj Mahal's damage is a well-known example of this difference."

The treatment process removes harmful substances and pathogens, making the water safe to release. Untreated factory effluents, pesticide-contaminated water, and hospital waste all contain harmful substances that pollute water.",

The other options — untreated factory waste, pesticide-contaminated water, and hospital waste — all introduce harmful substances into water bodies."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Depletion of the ozone layer is NOT caused by acid rain — it is caused by CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons). Students often confuse the effects of different types of air pollution. Acid rain corrodes marble (marble cancer), damages vegetation by making soil acidic, and lowers the pH of water bodies, killing sensitive aquatic species. Ozone depletion is a separate problem caused by entirely different chemicals.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Acid rain does corrode marble monuments, damage vegetation, and acidify lakes. However, ozone depletion is caused by CFCs, not by acid rain. Acid rain (from SO2 and NOx) and ozone depletion (from CFCs) are two different environmental problems with different causes and effects."

        }
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Acid rain damages marble because of a chemical reaction between the acids (sulphuric acid and nitric acid) in the rain and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the marble. The acid dissolves the calcium carbonate, producing soluble calcium sulphate or calcium nitrate, water, and carbon dioxide. This chemical corrosion gradually eats away the marble surface, causing the damage known as marble cancer.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The damage is not from physical force, water absorption, or soot deposition. It is a chemical reaction: the sulphuric and nitric acids in acid rain react with calcium carbonate in marble, dissolving it. This is why the damage is called marble cancer — the marble is chemically eaten away."

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Carbon monoxide is more immediately dangerous because it binds to haemoglobin about 200 times more strongly than oxygen does. Even small amounts of CO in inhaled air can quickly reduce the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity, leading to headaches, dizziness, unconsciousness, and even death. CO2, while harmful as a greenhouse gas over long periods, does not bind to haemoglobin in this way and is not acutely toxic at normal atmospheric concentrations.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "CO is odourless, not pungent. It does not cause acid rain (that is SO2 and NOx) or destroy the ozone layer (that is CFCs). Its immediate danger comes from its strong affinity for haemoglobin — it blocks oxygen transport in the blood, which can be rapidly fatal."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "Although algal growth initially adds plant life, the problem begins when the excessive algae die. Decomposer bacteria break down the dead algae, and this decomposition process consumes large amounts of dissolved oxygen from the water. When dissolved oxygen falls too low (a condition called hypoxia), fish and other aquatic organisms that depend on dissolved oxygen to breathe cannot survive and die of suffocation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "While algae can block sunlight, the primary reason for fish death is oxygen depletion. The algae do not poison fish or steal their food. The critical chain of events is: excess nutrients lead to algal bloom, algae die, bacterial decomposition of dead algae consumes dissolved oxygen, and fish suffocate due to lack of oxygen."
