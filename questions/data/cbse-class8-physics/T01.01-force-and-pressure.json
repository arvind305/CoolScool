    "text": "A force is a push or pull acting on an object. Forces can change the speed, direction of motion, or shape of an object. Forces are broadly classified into contact forces (muscular force, friction) and non-contact forces (gravitational, magnetic, electrostatic). Pressure is the force acting per unit area. Pressure = Force / Area, and its SI unit is Pascal (Pa). For a given force, pressure increases when the area decreases and vice versa. Liquids exert pressure on the walls and bottom of the container, and this pressure increases with depth. Gases also exert pressure; the atmosphere exerts atmospheric pressure on all surfaces, which is demonstrated by many everyday phenomena.",
    "rules": [
      "A force is a push or pull that can change the state of motion or shape of an object.",
      "Contact forces require physical contact (e.g., muscular force, friction).",
      "Non-contact forces act from a distance (e.g., gravity, magnetism, electrostatic force).",
      "A force can make a stationary object move, stop a moving object, or change its direction.",
      "Pressure = Force / Area; SI unit is Pascal (Pa).",
      "For a given force, smaller area results in greater pressure.",
      "Liquids exert pressure equally in all directions at the same depth.",
      "Liquid pressure increases with depth.",
      "Atmospheric pressure is the pressure exerted by the weight of air in the atmosphere.",
      "Applications: sharp knives cut better (small area, high pressure), wide tyres reduce pressure on road."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "At higher altitudes, atmospheric pressure decreases because there is a shorter column of air above. Less air means less weight pressing down, resulting in lower atmospheric pressure.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Proximity to the sun (A) does not cause higher pressure. Pressure does not remain the same (C) at different altitudes. Air speed (D) is not the primary factor. The shorter air column at higher altitudes (B) means less weight and therefore lower pressure."
