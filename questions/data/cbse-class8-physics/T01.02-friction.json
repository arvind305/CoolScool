    "text": "Friction is a force that opposes the relative motion between two surfaces in contact. It is caused by the irregularities (roughness) on the surfaces that interlock with each other. Friction depends on the nature of the surfaces and the force pressing them together. There are three types of friction: static friction (opposes the tendency to move), sliding friction (opposes sliding motion), and rolling friction (opposes rolling motion). Static friction is the greatest, followed by sliding friction, and rolling friction is the least. Friction has both advantages (walking, writing, braking) and disadvantages (wear, heat, energy loss). Friction can be increased by making surfaces rough and reduced by using lubricants, ball bearings, polishing, or streamlining.",

      "explanation_correct": "The heavier block presses harder on the surface, causing greater interlocking of surface irregularities. This results in more friction acting on the heavier block compared to the lighter one.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Friction is not the same (A) because the weights differ. The lighter block has less friction (B is wrong). Friction is not zero (D). The heavier block experiences more friction (C) due to the greater pressing force."
