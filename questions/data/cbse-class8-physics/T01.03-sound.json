    "text": "Sound is produced by vibrating objects. When an object vibrates, it creates disturbances in the surrounding medium (solid, liquid, or gas) that travel as sound waves. Sound cannot travel through a vacuum because it needs a material medium to propagate. The frequency of a sound is the number of oscillations per second, measured in Hertz (Hz). The amplitude is the maximum displacement from the mean position. Loudness of sound depends on its amplitude — greater amplitude means louder sound. Pitch depends on frequency — higher frequency means higher pitch. The audible range for humans is 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Unwanted sound is called noise, while pleasant, rhythmic sound is called music. Noise pollution from various sources can harm health and should be controlled.",
