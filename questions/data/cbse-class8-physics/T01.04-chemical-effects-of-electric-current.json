    "text": "Some liquids conduct electricity while others do not. Liquids that conduct electricity are called conducting solutions (e.g., salt water, lemon juice, acid solutions). Distilled water is a poor conductor, but adding salt or acid makes it a good conductor. When electric current passes through a conducting liquid, it can cause chemical changes — this is called the chemical effect of electric current. These effects include deposition of metal on electrodes, production of gas bubbles, and change in colour of the solution. Electroplating is a practical application where a thin layer of a desired metal is coated onto another object using electric current. LED testers can be used to detect even weak currents flowing through liquids.",
