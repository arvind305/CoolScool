    "text": "Certain natural phenomena like lightning and earthquakes are caused by forces within nature. Lightning is caused by the accumulation of electric charges in clouds. When some objects are rubbed against each other, they become charged — this is called charging by rubbing (friction). There are two types of charges: positive and negative. Like charges repel and unlike charges attract. An electroscope can detect the presence of charge on a body. Lightning occurs when massive electric charges discharge between clouds or between a cloud and the ground. Lightning conductors protect buildings by providing a safe path for the charge to flow to the ground. Earthquakes are caused by sudden movements deep inside the Earth's crust, measured on the Richter scale using a seismograph.",
