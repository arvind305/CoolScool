    "text": "Light travels in straight lines, which is called rectilinear propagation. When light falls on a smooth, polished surface like a mirror, it bounces back — this is called reflection. The laws of reflection state that: (1) the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, and (2) the incident ray, reflected ray, and normal all lie in the same plane. Regular reflection occurs on smooth surfaces and produces clear images, while diffused reflection occurs on rough surfaces and scatters light in different directions. A plane mirror forms a virtual, erect, laterally inverted image of the same size as the object. Multiple mirrors can produce multiple images. Sunlight (white light) is composed of seven colours (VIBGYOR), and when passed through a prism, it splits into these colours — this is called dispersion. The human eye works like a camera, with parts like cornea, iris, pupil, lens, and retina working together to form images.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The formula n = (360/θ) - 1 shows that as θ decreases, n increases. Parallel mirrors (θ = 0) give infinite images."
