    "text": "Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as p/q where p and q are integers and q is not zero. They include all integers, fractions, and terminating or repeating decimals. Rational numbers satisfy closure, commutativity, and associativity for addition and multiplication. The additive identity is 0, the multiplicative identity is 1. Every rational number a/b has an additive inverse -a/b and (if non-zero) a multiplicative inverse b/a. Between any two rational numbers, there are infinitely many rational numbers.",
