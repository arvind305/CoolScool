Check: 97 x 4 = 388. Not 297. Actually let me try directly: AB x 4 = CAB means the result starts with C and ends with AB. 97 x 4 = 388, not 397. 75 x 4 = 300, not 375. 25 x 4 = 100, not 125. This puzzle format means the 3-digit result has C as hundreds, A as tens, B as units. So (10A+B) x 4 = 100C+10A+B. Then 3(10A+B)=100C. For C=3: 10A+B=100 (impossible). For C=3 with carry adjustments, we need a different approach. Simply checking: 97 x 4 = 388 (C=3, but not 397).",
