    "text": "Graphs provide a visual representation of data and relationships between variables. The Cartesian coordinate system uses two perpendicular axes (x-axis and y-axis) meeting at the origin. Every point is represented as (x, y). Line graphs show change over time using connected data points. Linear graphs represent equations of the form y = mx + c, where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept.",

      "A linear equation y = mx + c gives a straight line graph",
