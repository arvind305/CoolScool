    "text": "The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of all living organisms. Robert Hooke first discovered cells in 1665 by observing cork under a microscope. The cell theory states that all living organisms are composed of cells, the cell is the basic unit of life, and all cells arise from pre-existing cells. Cells have a plasma membrane that is selectively permeable, controlling what enters and leaves the cell through osmosis and diffusion. Plant cells additionally have a rigid cell wall made of cellulose. The nucleus contains genetic material (DNA) organized as chromosomes. Important cell organelles include the endoplasmic reticulum (protein and lipid synthesis), Golgi apparatus (packaging and secretion), mitochondria (energy production via ATP), lysosomes (digestion of waste), and plastids (found only in plant cells). Cells are broadly classified as prokaryotic (lacking a membrane-bound nucleus, e.g., bacteria) and eukaryotic (having a membrane-bound nucleus, e.g., plant and animal cells). Cells reproduce through cell division — mitosis for growth and repair, and meiosis for producing gametes.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The cell will not swell up — that happens in a hypotonic solution. The cell will not burst because the rigid cell wall prevents it (unlike animal cells which can burst). The cell is affected because osmosis occurs due to the concentration difference."

      "explanation_correct": "Mitochondria are called the powerhouse of the cell because they carry out cellular respiration and produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is the energy currency used by cells for all their activities.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'mitochondria'. No other organelle is referred to as the powerhouse of the cell. Mitochondria specifically produce ATP through the process of cellular respiration."

      "correct_answer": "osmosis",
      "explanation_correct": "Osmosis is the process by which water molecules move from a region of higher water concentration to a region of lower water concentration through a selectively permeable membrane. It is a special type of diffusion.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'osmosis'. While diffusion is the general movement of molecules from high to low concentration, osmosis specifically refers to the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane."

      "correct_answer": "prokaryotic",
      "explanation_correct": "Prokaryotic cells are cells that lack a membrane-bound nucleus. The term 'prokaryotic' literally means 'before nucleus'. In these cells, the genetic material (DNA) lies free in the cytoplasm in a region called the nucleoid. Examples include bacteria and cyanobacteria.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'prokaryotic'. Cells with a membrane-bound nucleus are called eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotic cells are simpler, smaller, and lack all membrane-bound organelles."

      "correct_answer": "lysosomes",
      "explanation_correct": "Lysosomes are called the suicide bags of the cell because they contain powerful digestive (hydrolytic) enzymes. When a cell is damaged beyond repair, the lysosome membrane ruptures, releasing these enzymes which then digest the entire cell contents — a process called autolysis.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'lysosomes'. No other organelle is called the suicide bag. Lysosomes specifically contain hydrolytic enzymes that can destroy the cell itself when needed."

      "correct_answer": "meiosis",
      "explanation_correct": "Meiosis is the reductive cell division that produces four daughter cells (gametes), each with half the number of chromosomes of the parent cell. This is essential for sexual reproduction to maintain a constant chromosome number across generations.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'meiosis'. Mitosis produces two identical daughter cells with the same chromosome number. Meiosis is the specific type of division that halves the chromosome number to form gametes."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'Golgi apparatus'. While the endoplasmic reticulum synthesizes proteins and lipids, it is the Golgi apparatus that receives, modifies, packages, and dispatches these materials."

      "correct_answer": "plasmolysis",
      "explanation_correct": "Plasmolysis is the process in which the cell membrane of a plant cell shrinks away from the cell wall when the cell is placed in a hypertonic solution. Water leaves the cell by exosmosis, causing the protoplasm to contract and pull away from the cell wall.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'plasmolysis'. This occurs specifically in plant cells placed in a hypertonic solution. The reverse process, where the cell regains water and the membrane returns to its normal position, is called deplasmolysis."
