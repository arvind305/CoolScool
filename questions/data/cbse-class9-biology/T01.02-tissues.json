    "text": "A tissue is a group of cells that have a similar structure and function, working together as a unit. In multicellular organisms, tissues allow division of labour, making the organism more efficient. Plant tissues are broadly classified as meristematic (actively dividing, found at growing tips) and permanent (differentiated, no longer dividing). Simple permanent tissues include parenchyma (thin-walled, stores food), collenchyma (thickened corners, provides flexibility), and sclerenchyma (thick lignified walls, dead cells, provides mechanical strength). Complex permanent tissues include xylem (transports water and minerals upward) and phloem (transports food from leaves to other parts). Animal tissues are classified into four types: epithelial tissue (covers body surfaces and lines organs), connective tissue (connects and supports different organs — includes blood, bone, cartilage), muscular tissue (responsible for movement — striated, smooth, and cardiac), and nervous tissue (transmits nerve impulses via neurons).",

      "A tissue is a group of cells with similar structure and function.",
      "Meristematic tissue is found at growth points and cells divide continuously.",
      "Permanent tissue forms when meristematic cells differentiate and lose the ability to divide.",
      "Parenchyma has thin cell walls, stores food, and performs photosynthesis (chlorenchyma).",
      "Collenchyma provides flexibility with irregularly thickened corners.",
      "Sclerenchyma has thick, lignified walls and is dead at maturity — provides mechanical strength.",
      "Xylem transports water and minerals from roots to leaves (upward).",
      "Phloem transports prepared food from leaves to other parts of the plant.",
      "Epithelial tissue forms a protective covering on body surfaces and organ linings.",
      "Connective tissue includes blood, bone, cartilage, ligament, tendon, and adipose tissue.",
      "Striated (skeletal) muscle is voluntary; smooth (unstriated) muscle is involuntary; cardiac muscle is involuntary and found only in the heart.",
