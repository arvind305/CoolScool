    "text": "The diversity of living organisms on Earth is enormous. To study this diversity, scientists classify organisms into groups based on their similarities and differences. Classification follows a hierarchy: Kingdom, Phylum (or Division for plants), Class, Order, Family, Genus, and Species. R.H. Whittaker proposed the five kingdom classification: Monera (prokaryotes like bacteria), Protista (unicellular eukaryotes like Amoeba), Fungi (saprophytes like mushroom), Plantae (autotrophic plants), and Animalia (heterotrophic animals). Plants are further classified into Thallophyta (algae), Bryophyta (mosses), Pteridophyta (ferns), Gymnosperms (conifers), and Angiosperms (flowering plants with monocots and dicots). Animals are classified into phyla such as Porifera, Coelenterata, Platyhelminthes, Nematoda, Annelida, Arthropoda, Mollusca, Echinodermata, and Chordata. Vertebrates include Pisces (fish), Amphibia (frogs), Reptilia (lizards), Aves (birds), and Mammalia (mammals). Carolus Linnaeus introduced the binomial nomenclature system using genus and species names.",
