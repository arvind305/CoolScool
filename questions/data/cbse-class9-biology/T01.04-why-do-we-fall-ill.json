    "text": "Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease. Disease literally means 'dis-ease' or being uncomfortable. Diseases can be broadly classified as acute (short duration, e.g., common cold) and chronic (long duration, e.g., tuberculosis). Based on causes, diseases are infectious (caused by pathogens like bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, and worms and can spread from person to person) or non-infectious (caused by internal factors and do not spread). Infectious diseases spread through air (droplet infection), water, food, direct contact, and vectors (animals that carry pathogens, e.g., mosquitoes spreading malaria). The immune system defends the body against pathogens through barriers (skin, mucus) and the immune response (white blood cells, antibodies). Treatment involves killing the pathogen (antibiotics for bacteria) or reducing symptoms. Prevention is better than cure and includes vaccination, personal hygiene, clean water, proper sanitation, and vector control.",
