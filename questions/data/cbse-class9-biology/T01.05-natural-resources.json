    "text": "Life on Earth exists in the biosphere — the narrow zone where the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere interact. The atmosphere is divided into layers, with the troposphere being the lowermost layer where weather occurs. Air contains 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and small amounts of CO2 and other gases. Water covers about 75% of Earth's surface. Biogeochemical cycles recycle essential elements through the environment. The water cycle involves evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. The nitrogen cycle involves nitrogen fixation (by lightning and bacteria like Rhizobium), nitrification, and denitrification. The carbon cycle involves photosynthesis (removes CO2), respiration and combustion (adds CO2), and decomposition. The oxygen cycle maintains the balance through photosynthesis and respiration. Air pollution is caused by fossil fuel burning, vehicle emissions, and industrial waste, leading to acid rain and the greenhouse effect. Water pollution is caused by industrial waste, sewage, and agricultural chemicals. Soil is formed by weathering of rocks. The ozone layer in the stratosphere protects life from harmful UV radiation but is being depleted by CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons).",

      "explanation_correct": "The troposphere is the lowest layer of the atmosphere, extending up to about 12 km. It contains about 75% of the atmosphere's mass and almost all its water vapour. Virtually all weather phenomena — clouds, rain, snow, wind, and storms — occur in the troposphere.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The stratosphere contains the ozone layer. The mesosphere and exosphere are upper layers with minimal weather activity. The troposphere is where all weather occurs."

      "explanation_correct": "Ozone layer depletion allows more harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation to reach Earth's surface. Increased UV exposure raises the risk of skin cancer, cataracts (eye damage), weakened immune systems, and damage to marine organisms and crops.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Heart disease and diabetes are not directly caused by UV radiation. Malaria is caused by a parasite spread by mosquitoes. Skin cancer and cataracts are the direct health effects of increased UV exposure due to ozone depletion."

      "explanation_correct": "Biogeochemical cycles are the pathways through which essential elements (like carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and water) are recycled between the biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) components of the biosphere. 'Bio' refers to living, 'geo' to Earth, and 'chemical' to the elements involved.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'biogeochemical'. These cycles ensure that essential elements are continuously recycled and available for living organisms."
