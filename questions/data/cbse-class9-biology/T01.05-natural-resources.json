    "text": "Life on Earth exists in the biosphere — the narrow zone where the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere interact. The atmosphere is divided into layers, with the troposphere being the lowermost layer where weather occurs. Air contains 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and small amounts of CO2 and other gases. Water covers about 75% of Earth's surface. Biogeochemical cycles recycle essential elements through the environment. The water cycle involves evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. The nitrogen cycle involves nitrogen fixation (by lightning and bacteria like Rhizobium), nitrification, and denitrification. The carbon cycle involves photosynthesis (removes CO2), respiration and combustion (adds CO2), and decomposition. The oxygen cycle maintains the balance through photosynthesis and respiration. Air pollution is caused by fossil fuel burning, vehicle emissions, and industrial waste, leading to acid rain and the greenhouse effect. Water pollution is caused by industrial waste, sewage, and agricultural chemicals. Soil is formed by weathering of rocks. The ozone layer in the stratosphere protects life from harmful UV radiation but is being depleted by CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons).",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Ozone depletion and global warming are two distinct environmental problems. Ozone depletion is caused by CFCs destroying O3 in the stratosphere, allowing harmful UV radiation to reach Earth (causing skin cancer and cataracts). Global warming is caused by increased greenhouse gases (CO2, methane) trapping infrared radiation in the troposphere, raising Earth's temperature. They involve different chemicals, different atmospheric layers, and different types of radiation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "They are not the same phenomenon — they have different causes and effects. The ozone hole is real and well-documented. While there are some minor interactions, global warming is not the primary cause of ozone depletion. The key distinction is different pollutants, different layers, and different radiation types."

        }
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "The water cycle is biogeochemical because water moves through all three components: bio (living organisms absorb water, and plants release it through transpiration), geo (water flows through rivers, groundwater, and oceans on Earth's surface), and chemical (CO2 dissolves in rainwater forming carbonic acid, and water participates in photosynthesis). It is not merely physical evaporation and condensation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Water exists in both living and non-living systems. It can exist as solid, liquid, and gas (not just two phases). Water is critical to many biological processes. The 'biogeochemical' label reflects its movement through biological, geological, and chemical components."

      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "Topsoil is the most fertile layer because dead leaves, animal remains, and other organic matter decompose on the surface, creating humus. Humus gives topsoil its dark colour, improves water-holding capacity, provides essential nutrients, and supports a rich community of soil organisms (bacteria, fungi, earthworms). Subsoil has less humus, and bedrock is solid rock with no organic matter.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Topsoil particles are not the hardest — they are fine and mixed with organic matter. Groundwater is deeper, closer to subsoil and bedrock. Topsoil actually has good water-holding capacity because of humus. The fertility comes from high humus content and soil organisms."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Methane (CH4) is classified as a more potent greenhouse gas because each molecule of methane is about 25 times more effective at trapping infrared (heat) radiation than a molecule of CO2 over a 100-year period. This is called its Global Warming Potential (GWP). Although CO2 is more abundant, methane's higher heat-trapping ability per molecule makes it a more potent greenhouse gas.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Methane is not primarily associated with ozone destruction. Methane is lighter than CO2, not heavier. Greenhouse gases trap infrared radiation, not UV radiation. The potency comes from methane's greater ability to absorb and re-emit infrared heat per molecule."
