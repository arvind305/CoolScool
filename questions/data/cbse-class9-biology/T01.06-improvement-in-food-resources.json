    "text": "Food is essential for all living organisms and comes from plants (crops) and animals (livestock, fish, poultry). Crops are classified as kharif (sown in rainy season, e.g., paddy, maize, soybean) and rabi (sown in winter, e.g., wheat, gram, mustard). Crop improvement aims for higher yield, disease resistance, and quality through hybridisation (cross-breeding), introduction of desired genes, and genetic modification. Crop production management involves nutrient management (manures and fertilizers), irrigation, and cropping patterns (mixed cropping, intercropping, crop rotation). Manures are organic and improve soil structure, while fertilizers are chemical and provide specific nutrients (NPK). Crop protection involves controlling weeds, insect pests, and diseases using pesticides, biological control, and good agricultural practices. Proper storage prevents losses from biotic (insects, rodents) and abiotic (moisture, temperature) factors. Animal husbandry includes cattle farming (milch and draught breeds), poultry farming (broilers and layers), fish production (marine and inland fisheries), and bee keeping (apiculture) for honey and wax.",

      "explanation_correct": "Marine fishery involves catching fish from seas and oceans. Popular marine fish include pomfret, mackerel, tuna, sardines, and Bombay duck. Marine fishing uses trawlers, fishing nets, and other equipment to harvest fish from coastal and deep-sea waters.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Ponds, lakes, rivers, and canals are inland water sources (inland fishery). Aquariums are for ornamental purposes. Marine fishery specifically refers to fish from seas and oceans."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "In intercropping, crops are grown in separate rows in a definite pattern. This makes it easier to harvest each crop individually, apply specific treatments, and manage each crop separately. In mixed cropping, seeds are mixed, making individual management difficult.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Random sowing describes mixed cropping, not intercropping. Intercropping involves two or more crops, not one. Fertilizers may still be needed. The key advantage is the organized row arrangement."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Besides producing honey and beeswax, honey bees play a crucial role in the pollination of many crop plants. As they move from flower to flower collecting nectar, they transfer pollen, enabling fertilization and fruit/seed formation, which increases crop yield.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Bees do not eat harmful insects (that would be biological pest control by predators). They do not produce fertilizer or control weeds. Their major agricultural benefit beyond honey is pollination."
