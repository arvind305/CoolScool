    "text": "Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. It is made up of tiny particles that have space between them, are continuously moving, and attract each other. Matter exists in three common states: solid, liquid, and gas. Solids have definite shape and volume with strong intermolecular forces. Liquids have definite volume but no definite shape. Gases have neither definite shape nor volume. Matter can change state when temperature or pressure changes. The temperature at which a solid melts is its melting point, and the temperature at which a liquid boils is its boiling point. During change of state, temperature remains constant even though heat is supplied — this hidden heat is called latent heat. Evaporation is a surface phenomenon where liquid particles escape from the surface at any temperature below the boiling point, causing cooling.",

The other three options — having space between them, being in continuous motion, and attracting each other — are all characteristics of particles of matter as described in the kinetic theory.",

This demonstrates two properties: particles are in continuous motion, and there are spaces between particles of matter.",

Particles are neither created nor do they change their identity — they simply move and spread."

This is why water boils below 100°C on mountains.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The boiling point decreases at higher altitudes primarily due to reduced atmospheric pressure, not because of lower temperature or differences in oxygen levels or water purity.

      "correct_answer": "humidity",
      "explanation_correct": "Humidity is the amount of water vapour present in the air. When humidity is high, the air already contains a lot of water vapour and cannot easily accept more, so the rate of evaporation decreases. When humidity is low, the air can absorb more water vapour, increasing the rate of evaporation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'humidity'. Humidity measures the water vapour content of air. High humidity reduces the rate of evaporation because the air is already nearly saturated with water vapour, leaving less capacity to absorb more."

      "correct_answer": "deposition",
      "explanation_correct": "Deposition (also called desublimation) is the direct conversion of gas into solid without passing through the liquid state. It is the reverse of sublimation. An example is frost formation, where water vapour in the air directly converts to ice crystals on cold surfaces.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'deposition'. Deposition is the reverse process of sublimation. While sublimation converts solid directly to gas, deposition converts gas directly to solid. Formation of frost on cold surfaces is a common example of deposition."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Solids have a fixed shape because their particles are held in fixed positions by strong intermolecular forces of attraction. The particles can only vibrate about their mean positions but cannot move freely, giving solids their rigid structure.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Solids have fixed shape due to strong intermolecular forces holding particles in place. Solid particles do have kinetic energy (they vibrate), they do have some intermolecular spaces (just very small), and they are in motion (vibrating). The key factor is the strong forces keeping them in fixed positions."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The melting point and freezing point of a pure substance are numerically equal — they occur at the same temperature. The difference is only in the direction of the process: melting (solid to liquid) and freezing (liquid to solid) happen at the same temperature."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Diffusion is faster in gases because gas particles have more kinetic energy, move faster, and have much larger intermolecular spaces compared to liquids. This allows gas particles to travel greater distances in less time and mix more rapidly.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The faster diffusion in gases is due to the higher kinetic energy and larger intermolecular spaces of gas particles. Liquid particles do move but more slowly. Gas particles are not necessarily larger or heavier than liquid particles — the key factors are speed of movement and space between particles."

As the water evaporates, it absorbs heat from the surrounding air, making the air cooler. This is why desert coolers work best in hot, dry climates where evaporation rate is high.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Desert coolers use the principle of evaporative cooling. Water evaporating from wet pads absorbs latent heat from the surrounding air, reducing the air temperature. They are most effective in dry climates where low humidity allows rapid evaporation."

They sublime — meaning they change directly from solid to gas without becoming a liquid first. This is why there is no liquid residue left behind.
