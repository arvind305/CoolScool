    "text": "Matter can be classified as pure substances and mixtures. Pure substances include elements (which cannot be broken down further) and compounds (which are formed by chemical combination of elements in a fixed ratio). Mixtures are formed by mixing two or more substances in any ratio without any chemical reaction. Mixtures can be homogeneous (uniform composition, like solutions) or heterogeneous (non-uniform composition, like sand and water). Solutions have a solute dissolved in a solvent. Suspensions have large particles that settle on standing. Colloids have intermediate-sized particles that show the Tyndall effect. Various separation techniques such as evaporation, distillation, chromatography, centrifugation, and crystallisation are used to separate mixtures based on the physical properties of their components.",

      "explanation_correct": "Both methods work for separating iron filings from sulphur. Method A: sulphur dissolves in carbon disulphide while iron does not, so filtering separates them. Method B: iron is magnetic and can be picked up by a magnet, leaving sulphur behind. Both exploit different physical properties for separation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Both methods are valid for this separation. A magnet attracts iron filings (magnetic property), and carbon disulphide dissolves sulphur but not iron (solubility property). These methods would not work if iron and sulphur had been chemically combined to form iron sulphide (a compound)."
