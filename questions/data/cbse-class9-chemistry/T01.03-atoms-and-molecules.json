    "text": "The laws of chemical combination — the law of conservation of mass and the law of constant proportions — form the foundation of chemistry. Dalton's atomic theory states that all matter is made of indivisible atoms, atoms of the same element are identical, and atoms combine in simple whole-number ratios to form compounds. Atoms are the smallest particles of an element that take part in chemical reactions. Molecules are the smallest particles of a substance that can exist independently and retain all properties of that substance. Ions are charged atoms or groups of atoms. Chemical formulae represent the composition of compounds using symbols and subscripts. The atomic mass unit (u) is used to express atomic masses. Molecular mass is the sum of atomic masses of all atoms in a molecule. The mole concept, based on Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23), relates the number of particles to the mass of a substance.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'cation'. Cations are formed when atoms lose electrons (becoming positive), while anions are formed when atoms gain electrons (becoming negative). The word cation comes from the fact that these ions migrate towards the cathode in electrolysis."
