    "text": "The laws of chemical combination — the law of conservation of mass and the law of constant proportions — form the foundation of chemistry. Dalton's atomic theory states that all matter is made of indivisible atoms, atoms of the same element are identical, and atoms combine in simple whole-number ratios to form compounds. Atoms are the smallest particles of an element that take part in chemical reactions. Molecules are the smallest particles of a substance that can exist independently and retain all properties of that substance. Ions are charged atoms or groups of atoms. Chemical formulae represent the composition of compounds using symbols and subscripts. The atomic mass unit (u) is used to express atomic masses. Molecular mass is the sum of atomic masses of all atoms in a molecule. The mole concept, based on Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23), relates the number of particles to the mass of a substance.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "To compare the number of molecules, convert mass to moles. Moles = mass/molar mass. O2: 16/32 = 0.5 mol. SO2: 16/64 = 0.25 mol. The container with more moles has more molecules. O2 has 0.5 mol (about 3.011 × 10^23 molecules) while SO2 has 0.25 mol (about 1.506 × 10^23 molecules)."

      "explanation_correct": "The statement that 'all atoms of the same element have identical mass' seems reasonable and was part of Dalton's theory, but it is now known to be incorrect. Isotopes are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons, and thus different masses. For example, carbon-12 and carbon-14 are both carbon but have different masses.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Options A, C, and D are all still considered valid. Atoms do combine in whole-number ratios, reactions do involve atomic rearrangement, and mass is conserved. However, the discovery of isotopes (atoms of the same element with different masses, e.g., ³⁵Cl and ³⁷Cl) proved that not all atoms of the same element are identical in mass."

For example, 1 mole of H2 = 2 g, but 1 mole of CO2 = 44 g. The mole is a unit of amount (number of particles), not mass.",

Even though some postulates (like indivisibility of atoms and identical atoms) were later revised, the core framework was groundbreaking.",

      "explanation_correct": "NaCl is an ionic compound that exists as a continuous lattice of Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions, not as discrete NaCl molecules. Since no individual molecule exists, the term 'molecular mass' is technically inappropriate. Instead, 'formula unit mass' is used to describe the mass corresponding to one formula unit (one Na⁺ and one Cl⁻).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The distinction is not about the magnitude of mass (option A) or the number of element types (option C) or the physical state (option D). Many covalent solids use molecular mass. The reason is specifically that ionic compounds like NaCl form a lattice of ions rather than discrete molecules, making 'molecular mass' an inaccurate term."

This capitalisation rule prevents confusion between elements and compounds.",
