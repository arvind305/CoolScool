    "text": "The atom, once considered indivisible, is made up of three subatomic particles: electrons (discovered by J.J. Thomson), protons (discovered by Goldstein/Rutherford), and neutrons (discovered by Chadwick). Thomson proposed the plum pudding model where electrons are embedded in a sphere of positive charge. Rutherford's alpha particle scattering experiment led to the nuclear model: most of the atom is empty space, with a tiny dense positively charged nucleus at the centre, surrounded by electrons. Bohr improved on Rutherford's model by placing electrons in discrete energy levels (shells) around the nucleus. The maximum number of electrons in a shell is given by 2n^2. The atomic number (Z) equals the number of protons, and the mass number (A) equals the sum of protons and neutrons. Isotopes are atoms with the same atomic number but different mass numbers. Isobars are atoms with the same mass number but different atomic numbers.",

However, their chemical properties are identical because chemical behaviour depends on the number and arrangement of electrons, which is the same for all isotopes of an element.",

Not both parts are correct because chemical properties are identical (D). The error is in claiming different chemical properties — isotopes have the same chemical properties (B)."
