    "text": "Motion is the change in position of an object with respect to time and its surroundings. Distance is the total path length covered by an object (scalar quantity), while displacement is the shortest distance between the initial and final positions (vector quantity). Speed is distance per unit time and velocity is displacement per unit time. When an object covers equal distances in equal intervals of time, the motion is uniform; otherwise it is non-uniform. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. The three equations of motion for uniformly accelerated motion are: v = u + at, s = ut + ½at², and v² = u² + 2as. Distance-time and velocity-time graphs help visualize motion. In uniform circular motion, an object moves along a circular path with constant speed but changing velocity due to continuous change in direction.",
