    "text": "A force is a push or pull that can change an object's state of motion or shape. When balanced forces act on an object, the net force is zero and there is no change in motion. Unbalanced forces cause a change in the state of motion. Newton's first law states that an object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in uniform motion unless acted upon by an unbalanced external force. This tendency is called inertia, and mass is a measure of inertia. Newton's second law states that force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma). The unit of force is the Newton. Newton's third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Momentum (p = mv) is conserved in an isolated system — the total momentum before and after a collision remains the same.",
