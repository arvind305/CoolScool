    "text": "Every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force called gravitational force. Newton's universal law of gravitation states that the gravitational force between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them: F = Gm₁m₂/r². The gravitational constant G = 6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ N·m²/kg². When an object falls freely under gravity, it experiences acceleration due to gravity (g = 9.8 m/s²). Mass is the amount of matter in a body and remains constant everywhere, while weight is the gravitational force on the body (W = mg) and varies with location. Thrust is the force acting perpendicular to a surface, and pressure is thrust per unit area. Buoyancy is the upward force exerted by a fluid on a submerged object. Archimedes' principle states that the buoyant force equals the weight of fluid displaced.",
