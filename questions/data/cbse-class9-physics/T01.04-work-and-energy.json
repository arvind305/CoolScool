    "text": "In physics, work is done when a force acts on an object and causes displacement in the direction of the force. Work = Force × Displacement × cos θ. Work is measured in Joules (J). No work is done when the force is perpendicular to displacement (like carrying a bag horizontally) or when there is no displacement. Kinetic energy (KE = ½mv²) is the energy of a body in motion, and potential energy (PE = mgh) is energy due to position or height. The work-energy theorem states that work done equals change in kinetic energy. The law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed. Power is the rate of doing work (P = W/t) measured in Watts. The commercial unit of energy is kilowatt-hour (kWh), where 1 kWh = 3.6 × 10⁶ J.",
