    "text": "Sound is a form of energy produced by vibrating objects. It travels as a longitudinal wave through a material medium by creating compressions (regions of high pressure) and rarefactions (regions of low pressure). Sound cannot travel through a vacuum. The speed of sound depends on the medium: it is fastest in solids, slower in liquids, and slowest in gases. In air at 20°C, the speed of sound is approximately 344 m/s. The key characteristics of sound are frequency (determines pitch, measured in Hz), amplitude (determines loudness), and wavelength. The relationship v = fλ connects speed, frequency, and wavelength. Sound reflects from surfaces following the laws of reflection. An echo is a reflected sound heard separately, requiring a minimum distance of about 17.2 m. Humans can hear sounds from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Frequencies below 20 Hz are infrasound and above 20,000 Hz are ultrasound. Ultrasound has many applications including SONAR and medical imaging.",
