    "text": "The number system in Class 9 covers real numbers, which include both rational and irrational numbers. A rational number can be expressed as p/q where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. An irrational number cannot be expressed as p/q; examples include √2, √3, and π. Every real number has a unique point on the number line. Decimal expansions help distinguish rationals (terminating or non-terminating recurring) from irrationals (non-terminating non-recurring). Laws of exponents extend to all real numbers, and rationalisation is used to simplify expressions with surds in the denominator.",
