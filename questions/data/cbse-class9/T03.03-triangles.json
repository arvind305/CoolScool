The five congruence rules are SAS (Side-Angle-Side), ASA (Angle-Side-Angle), AAS (Angle-Angle-Side), SSS (Side-Side-Side), and RHS (Right angle-Hypotenuse-Side). In an isosceles triangle, angles opposite to equal sides are equal, and vice versa. The triangle inequality theorem states that the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side, and the side opposite the larger angle is longer.",
