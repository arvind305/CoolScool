    "text": "A circle is the set of all points equidistant from a fixed point (centre). Key theorems: equal chords subtend equal angles at the centre; the perpendicular from the centre to a chord bisects the chord; equal chords are equidistant from the centre. The angle subtended by an arc at the centre is twice the angle at any point on the remaining circle. Angles in the same segment are equal. The angle in a semicircle is 90°. Opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral sum to 180°.",

Angle ACB = 90° (angle in semicircle). In cyclic quadrilateral, angle ADC = angle subtended by arc ABC at D. Since AB is a diameter, the arc from A to B through C (the semicircle containing C) subtends 90° at D. Actually: angle ADB = 90° if AB is diameter and D is on the circle. But here ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral with AB as diameter, so both C and D are on the circle. Angle ACB = 90° and we need angle ADC. Without more info, angle ADC depends on where D is. However, if AB subtends angle ADB = 90° (as AB is diameter), then angle ADB = 90°. But the question asks angle ADC. Since D is between A and B on the arc (in the quadrilateral), this gets complex. Given the options, angle ADC = 90° is the intended answer (D is on the semicircle with diameter AB).","explanation_incorrect":"If AB is a diameter, any angle inscribed in the semicircle (angle on AB) is 90°."},
