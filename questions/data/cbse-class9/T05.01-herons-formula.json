  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Heron's formula allows us to find the area of a triangle when all three sides are known, without needing the height. For a triangle with sides a, b, c: first calculate the semi-perimeter s = (a+b+c)/2, then the area = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)). This formula works for all triangles (scalene, isosceles, equilateral). For finding the area of a quadrilateral, divide it into two triangles by drawing a diagonal and apply Heron's formula to each triangle.",
    "rules": ["Semi-perimeter: s = (a+b+c)/2","Area = sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c))","For equilateral triangle with side a: s = 3a/2, Area = (sqrt(3)/4)*a^2","For quadrilateral: divide into triangles using a diagonal and sum the areas","Always verify triangle inequality before applying the formula","The formula gives area in square units"]
