    "text": "Probability is a measure of the chance that an event will occur. In Class 9, we study experimental (empirical) probability, where probability is determined from actual trials or observations. Experimental probability of an event E = (number of trials in which E occurred) / (total number of trials). The probability of any event lies between 0 and 1 (inclusive). P(E) + P(not E) = 1. As the number of trials increases, the experimental probability approaches the theoretical probability.",
