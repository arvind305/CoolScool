      "explanation_incorrect": "Water in a river does not stay still. It keeps moving and flowing, usually from higher ground to lower ground. This is why the statement 'Water in a river flows' is true. If the water in a river did not flow, it would become dirty and stagnant."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The answer is not 'faucet' or 'sink'. The tap is the part that we use to control the flow of water. We should turn off the tap when we are not using water so that we don't waste it. Leaving the tap running when not in use can cause a lot of water to be wasted."
