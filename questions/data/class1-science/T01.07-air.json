      "explanation_correct": "Wind is moving air. When air moves over wet clothes, it blows away the wetness much faster. Still air does not move, so it cannot blow the wetness away as quickly. That is why clothes dry faster on a windy day.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Wind is not hot like fire and is not made of water. The real reason is that wind is moving air. Moving air blows over the wet clothes and takes away the wetness faster. Still air does not move, so clothes take much longer to dry."
