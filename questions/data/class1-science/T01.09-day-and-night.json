At night, when the sun is gone and the sky is dark, the moon's gentle glow becomes easy to see. The moon is often still in the sky during the day, but the bright sunlight makes it hard to notice.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The moon does not come out only at night. Sometimes the moon is in the sky during the day too, but the sun's brightness makes it hard to see. The moon is not scared of the sun and does not hide behind clouds. The real reason is that the sun's bright light during the day makes the moon hard to see."

      "explanation_correct": "We turn on lights at night because the sun is not there to give us light. Without the sun, it becomes dark at night and we cannot see inside our house. So we use lights like bulbs and lamps to help us see until we go to sleep.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "We do not turn on lights because we like bright colours, because the moon asked us, or because lights make food taste better. We need lights at night because the sun has set and it is dark. Without lights, we would not be able to see anything inside our house at night."
