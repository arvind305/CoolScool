Safety habits protect us from danger - we should look both ways before crossing the road and not talk to strangers. Good manners like saying please, thank you, and sorry make us nice. Healthy habits include eating good food, drinking water, exercising, and sleeping on time.",

We need to brush twice a day, once in the morning and once before bed, to make sure we remove all the food and germs that can cause cavities and make our teeth unhealthy. Brushing three times a day is also good, but twice a day is the minimum to keep our teeth healthy."
