    "text": "Classification is the process of putting objects into groups based on what they have in common, such as color, size, or shape. Sorting means arranging objects by looking at one property at a time. Objects that share the same property belong to the same group, and an object that does not share that property does not belong to that group.",
    "rules": [
      "Objects can be grouped by color, size, or shape.",
      "All objects in a group must share the same chosen property.",
      "An object that does not share the group property is the odd one out.",
      "You sort by looking at one property at a time.",
