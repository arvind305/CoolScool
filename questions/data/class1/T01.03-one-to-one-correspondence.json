    "text": "One-to-one correspondence means matching each object in one group to exactly one object in another group. For example, if there are 4 cups and 4 saucers, each cup goes on one saucer. This helps us compare groups and understand if they have the same number, more, or fewer objects.",
    "rules": [
      "Each object in one group is paired with exactly one object in the other group.",
      "No object is left without a pair if the groups are equal.",
      "If one group has objects left over after matching, that group has more.",

      "explanation_correct": "Clapping once for each step practices one-to-one rhythm. This means clapping matches each step with one clap, so the rhythm is in sync with the movement. This helps you keep a steady beat and understand how actions can match up one-to-one.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Clapping once for each step does not practice one-to-one matching, counting, or sharing. One-to-one matching is when each object in one group is paired with exactly one object in another group. One-to-one counting is when you say one number for each object you count. One-to-one sharing is when you give one object to each person. Clapping to the rhythm of steps is about keeping a steady beat, not these other one-to-one concepts."
