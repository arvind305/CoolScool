    "text": "One-to-one correspondence means matching each object in one group to exactly one object in another group. For example, if there are 4 cups and 4 saucers, each cup goes on one saucer. This helps us compare groups and understand if they have the same number, more, or fewer objects.",
    "rules": [
      "Each object in one group is paired with exactly one object in the other group.",
      "No object is left without a pair if the groups are equal.",
      "If one group has objects left over after matching, that group has more.",
      "Matching objects one-to-one helps us tell which group has more, fewer, or the same number."
