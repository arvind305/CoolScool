    "text": "Numbers from 1 to 20 are used to count things around us. Each number has a name (like 'seven') and a numeral (like '7'). Zero (0) means there is nothing. We can count objects by touching them one by one or by looking at pictures.",
    "rules": [
      "Numbers go in order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20.",
      "Each number has a name: 1 is 'one', 2 is 'two', and so on up to 20 is 'twenty'.",
      "Zero (0) means none or nothing — there are no objects to count.",
      "We can count objects one by one by pointing to each object and saying the next number.",
      "Subitizing means seeing a small group (up to 5) and knowing how many there are without counting one by one."
