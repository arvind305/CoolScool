    "text": "Addition means putting two groups together to find how many there are in all. We use the plus sign (+) to show addition and the equals sign (=) to show the answer. For example, if you have 3 apples and get 2 more apples, you have 3 + 2 = 5 apples in all. The answer of an addition is called the sum. When we add zero to any number, the number stays the same. Also, we can add two numbers in any order and get the same answer: 3 + 5 = 5 + 3.",
    "rules": [
      "Addition means combining two groups to find the total.",
      "The plus sign (+) is used between the two numbers being added.",
      "The equals sign (=) is used before the answer (sum).",
      "Adding zero to any number gives the same number: a + 0 = a.",
      "You can swap the order of the numbers and the sum stays the same: a + b = b + a. This is the commutative property.",
