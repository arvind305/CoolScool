    "text": "Subtraction means taking away from a group to find how many are left. We use the minus sign (−) to show subtraction and the equals sign (=) to show the answer. For example, if you have 7 balloons and 3 fly away, you have 7 − 3 = 4 balloons left. The answer of a subtraction is called the difference. Subtraction can also mean finding how many more one group has than another. Subtraction is the opposite of addition: if 5 + 3 = 8, then 8 − 3 = 5.",
