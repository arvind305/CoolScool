    "text": "2D shapes are flat shapes that have length and width. The four basic shapes are circle, triangle, rectangle, and square. A circle is round and has no sides or corners. A triangle has 3 sides and 3 corners. A rectangle has 4 sides and 4 corners, with opposite sides equal. A square has 4 equal sides and 4 corners. We can see these shapes all around us in everyday objects.",
