    "text": "3D shapes are solid shapes that take up space. They are not flat like 2D shapes. The five basic 3D shapes are sphere (like a ball), cube (like a dice), cuboid (like a brick or box), cone (like an ice cream cone), and cylinder (like a tin can). Some 3D shapes can roll because they have curved surfaces, like a sphere and a cylinder. Some shapes slide because they have flat faces, like a cube and a cuboid. 3D shapes have faces (flat parts), edges (where two faces meet), and vertices (corners).",

      "A cube has all equal square faces, like a dice.",
