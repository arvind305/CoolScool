    "text": "Length tells us how long or short something is. We can compare two objects to see which is longer, shorter, or if they are the same length. We can also describe things as tall or short. To measure length without a ruler, we can use non-standard units like handspans, footsteps, or sticks. Standard units like centimetre (cm) and metre (m) are also used to measure length, but we will learn more about them later.",
    "rules": [
      "We compare two objects to tell which is longer and which is shorter.",
      "If two objects have the same length, we say they are equal in length.",
      "Tall and short describe height; long and short describe length.",
      "We can measure length using non-standard units like handspans, footsteps, or sticks.",
      "When measuring with non-standard units, we place them end to end without gaps or overlaps.",
      "We can arrange objects in order from shortest to longest or longest to shortest.",
