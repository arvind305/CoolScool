    "text": "We can compare objects to find which one is heavy and which one is light. A heavy object weighs more and a light object weighs less. When we hold one object in each hand, we can feel which one is heavier and which one is lighter. If both feel the same, they have equal weight. We can also use a simple balance scale to compare. The side that goes down holds the heavier object and the side that goes up holds the lighter object. If both sides are level, the objects have equal weight. We can sort objects into groups of heavy and light.",

      "Heavy means an object weighs more. Light means an object weighs less.",
      "When comparing two objects, one may be heavier, one may be lighter, or they may have equal weight.",
