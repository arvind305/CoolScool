    "text": "Capacity tells us how much a container can hold. Some containers hold more and some hold less. When a container has nothing inside, it is empty. When it is filled to the top, it is full. When it is filled halfway, it is half-full. We can compare two containers by pouring water from one into the other. We can also measure how much a container holds by using small cups or spoons. For example, a jug may hold 5 cups of water and a bucket may hold 10 cups of water. The bucket holds more than the jug.",
