  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Capacity tells us how much a container can hold. Some containers hold more and some hold less. When a container has nothing inside, it is empty. When it is filled to the top, it is full. When it is filled halfway, it is half-full. We can compare two containers by pouring water from one into the other. We can also measure how much a container holds by using small cups or spoons. For example, a jug may hold 5 cups of water and a bucket may hold 10 cups of water. The bucket holds more than the jug.",
    "rules": [
      "Capacity means how much a container can hold inside it.",
      "Full means the container is filled to the top.",
      "Empty means the container has nothing inside.",
      "Half-full means the container is filled halfway.",
      "We compare capacity using words: more, less, or equal.",
      "We can pour from one container into another to compare which holds more.",
      "We can use non-standard units like cups and spoons to measure capacity.",
      "A container that needs more cups to fill holds more water."
