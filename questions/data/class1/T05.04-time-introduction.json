    "text": "Time tells us when things happen. During the day it is light because the sun is out, and during the night it is dark. There are 7 days in a week: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. A year has 12 months. There are different seasons like summer, winter, rainy and spring. We use the words yesterday, today and tomorrow to talk about days that have passed, the present day and the next day. A clock has two hands: a short hand (hour hand) and a long hand (minute hand). When the long hand points to 12, we read the hour that the short hand points to and say o'clock. For example, if the short hand points to 3 and the long hand points to 12, the time is 3 o'clock.",
