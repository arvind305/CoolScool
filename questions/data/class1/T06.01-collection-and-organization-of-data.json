    "text": "Data means information we collect by looking at things and counting them. We can count how many children like each fruit, or how many red flowers are in a garden. After counting, we use tally marks to keep track. One tally mark looks like a small standing line (|). We draw one line for each thing we count. When we reach five, we draw the fifth line across the first four (||||with a cross). Then we put our counts into a simple table so it is easy to read.",

      "A frequency table shows the name of each item and how many there are.",
