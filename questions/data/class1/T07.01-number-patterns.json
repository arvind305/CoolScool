    "text": "A number pattern is a list of numbers that follow a rule. In a repeating pattern, the same numbers come again and again, like 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2. In a growing pattern, the numbers get bigger each time, like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Skip counting is a special growing pattern where you jump by the same amount each time. When you skip count by 2s you say 2, 4, 6, 8. When you skip count by 5s you say 5, 10, 15, 20. When you skip count by 10s you say 10, 20, 30, 40. To find a missing number in a pattern, look at the rule the pattern follows and use it to fill in the blank.",
