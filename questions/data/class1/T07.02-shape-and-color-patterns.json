    "text": "A pattern is something that repeats again and again following a rule. We can make patterns using shapes like circles, squares, and triangles. We can also make patterns using colors like red, blue, and green. In an AB pattern, two things take turns: circle, square, circle, square. In an ABB pattern, one thing comes once and the next comes twice: circle, square, square, circle, square, square. In an ABC pattern, three different things take turns: circle, square, triangle, circle, square, triangle. To extend a pattern, find the rule and keep going. To create a pattern, pick shapes or colors and repeat them in the same order.",
    "rules": [
      "A pattern repeats the same group of shapes or colors over and over.",
      "An AB pattern has two items that take turns: A, B, A, B, A, B.",
      "An ABB pattern has one item then two of the next: A, B, B, A, B, B.",
      "An ABC pattern has three items that take turns: A, B, C, A, B, C.",
      "To find what comes next, look at the repeating group and continue it.",
      "You can make patterns with shapes, colors, or both."
