    "text": "A pattern is something that repeats again and again in the same order. We can see patterns all around us — in nature, on clothes, on floor tiles, and in beautiful designs. Stripes on a zebra, petals on a flower, and checks on a shirt are all patterns. When we look carefully, we can find patterns in our classroom, our home, and in festivals too.",
    "rules": [
      "A pattern is something that repeats in the same order.",
      "Animals like zebras and tigers have stripe patterns in nature.",
      "Flowers have petal patterns — petals are arranged in a repeating way.",
      "Clothes can have patterns like stripes, checks, dots, or flowers.",
      "Floor tiles, wall tiles, and fences can show repeating patterns.",
