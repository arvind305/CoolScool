    "text": "Cell division is the process by which a parent cell divides to produce daughter cells. The cell cycle consists of interphase (G1, S, G2 phases) where the cell prepares for division, and M phase where actual division occurs. Mitosis is the division of somatic cells producing two identical daughter cells with the same chromosome number (diploid). It occurs in four stages: prophase (chromosomes condense, nuclear membrane disappears), metaphase (chromosomes align at equator), anaphase (sister chromatids separate), and telophase (nuclear membrane reforms). Meiosis is the division of germ cells producing four genetically different daughter cells with half the chromosome number (haploid). It involves two divisions: Meiosis I (reductional) and Meiosis II (equational). Crossing over during prophase I of meiosis leads to genetic recombination and variation.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "The statement 'Mitosis maintains chromosome number; meiosis halves it' is correct because mitosis produces two daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell, with the same chromosome number. In contrast, meiosis produces four daughter cells with half the chromosome number of the parent cell, which is necessary for sexual reproduction.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option C is the correct answer. Mitosis is the cell division process that maintains the chromosome number of the parent cell in the daughter cells. It occurs in somatic cells and ensures that the DNA is replicated and the chromosomes are equally distributed to the two new cells. Meiosis, on the other hand, is the cell division process that halves the chromosome number, producing four genetically distinct daughter cells. This reduction in chromosome number is essential for sexual reproduction."

      "correct_answer": true,
      "explanation_correct": "During mitosis, the chromosome number is maintained in the daughter cells. This is because the DNA in the parent cell is replicated during the S phase of the cell cycle, and then the replicated chromosomes (now called sister chromatids) are equally divided between the two daughter cells during cell division.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement is incorrect because during mitosis, the chromosome number is not reduced. Mitosis is a process of cell division where the parent cell divides to form two genetically identical daughter cells, each with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell. This ensures that the genetic information is accurately passed on to the new cells."

This reduction in chromosome number from diploid to haploid is crucial for sexual reproduction and maintaining the correct chromosome count in the organism.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be that meiosis results in two daughter cells. This is not true because meiosis involves two rounds of cell division, Meiosis I and Meiosis II, which together produce four haploid daughter cells from a single diploid parent cell. The reduction in chromosome number from diploid to haploid is the defining feature of meiosis."

During meiosis, homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material, which leads to new combinations of alleles in the resulting gametes. This increased genetic variation in the offspring is an important mechanism for evolution and adaptation."

In both meiosis II and mitosis, the duplicated chromosomes (consisting of two sister chromatids) are pulled apart and move to the opposite poles of the cell during cell division.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Meiosis II is not the same as mitosis because in meiosis II, the cell is already haploid (having half the normal chromosome number) after the first meiotic division. Meiosis II simply separates the sister chromatids of the haploid chromosomes, resulting in four genetically unique haploid daughter cells. In mitosis, the parent cell is diploid, and the division results in two identical diploid daughter cells."
