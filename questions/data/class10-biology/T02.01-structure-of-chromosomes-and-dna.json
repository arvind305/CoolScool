    "text": "Chromosomes are thread-like structures in the nucleus made of DNA and proteins (histones). Each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids joined at the centromere. The ends of chromosomes are called telomeres. Chromosomes are classified based on centromere position: metacentric (middle), submetacentric (slightly off-center), acrocentric (near end), and telocentric (at end). Humans have 46 chromosomes (22 pairs of autosomes and 1 pair of sex chromosomes). DNA is a double helix composed of nucleotides, each containing a deoxyribose sugar, phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The bases are adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C), with A pairing with T and G pairing with C. Genes are segments of DNA that code for proteins. DNA replication is semi-conservative, meaning each new DNA molecule has one original and one new strand. RNA differs from DNA in having ribose sugar, uracil instead of thymine, and being single-stranded.",

If transcription is faulty, the mRNA will carry incorrect instructions, which will then be translated into a defective protein. This is the DNA to RNA step of the central dogma (DNA -> RNA -> Protein).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "DNA replication (Option A) copies DNA to DNA, not DNA to mRNA. Translation (Option C) converts mRNA to protein — the error occurs before this step, during the DNA-to-mRNA copying. Reverse transcription (Option D) converts RNA to DNA and occurs in certain viruses, not in normal human cells. The question specifically mentions copying from DNA to mRNA, which is transcription."

Centromeres are the regions where sister chromatids join on a chromosome. The correct term for alternate forms of the same gene is alleles."

Somatic cells are diploid with 23 pairs (46 total), while gametes have only half that number: 22 autosomes + 1 sex chromosome = 23 individual chromosomes.",

Option C is incorrect because gametes do not have pairs at all — they are haploid with 22 individual autosomes + 1 sex chromosome.

This internal base pairing is essential for tRNA's function as an adaptor molecule during translation.",

Option C overstates the case — RNA does not form a complete double helix like DNA, but it can have localised regions of base pairing.

If two purines (both double-ring) paired together, the helix would be too wide at that point. If two pyrimidines (both single-ring) paired, it would be too narrow. The purine-pyrimidine combination ensures the two sugar-phosphate backbones remain a consistent distance apart throughout the molecule.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because purines and pyrimidines are structurally different (double-ring vs single-ring).
