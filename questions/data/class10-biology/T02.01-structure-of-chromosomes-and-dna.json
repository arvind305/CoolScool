    "text": "Chromosomes are thread-like structures in the nucleus made of DNA and proteins (histones). Each chromosome consists of two sister chromatids joined at the centromere. The ends of chromosomes are called telomeres. Chromosomes are classified based on centromere position: metacentric (middle), submetacentric (slightly off-center), acrocentric (near end), and telocentric (at end). Humans have 46 chromosomes (22 pairs of autosomes and 1 pair of sex chromosomes). DNA is a double helix composed of nucleotides, each containing a deoxyribose sugar, phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The bases are adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C), with A pairing with T and G pairing with C. Genes are segments of DNA that code for proteins. DNA replication is semi-conservative, meaning each new DNA molecule has one original and one new strand. RNA differs from DNA in having ribose sugar, uracil instead of thymine, and being single-stranded.",

      "explanation_correct": "The centromere position on the chromosome determines the chromosome type, with the centromere position going from middle (metacentric) to slightly off-center (submetacentric) to near the end (acrocentric) to at the end (telocentric). This means the correct order from middle to end is Metacentric, Submetacentric, Acrocentric, Telocentric.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to arrange the chromosome types in the reverse order, from telocentric to metacentric. This is incorrect because the centromere position goes from middle to end, not the other way around. The correct order reflects this progression from middle to end of the chromosome."

Chromosomes are the most condensed form of DNA, as they consist of tightly packed chromatin fibers. Chromatin is less condensed than chromosomes, while the double helix structure and individual nucleotides are the least condensed levels of DNA organization.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Nucleotide, Double helix, Chromatin, Chromosome. This is incorrect because nucleotides are the basic building blocks of DNA, which then form the double helix structure. The double helix is then further organized into chromatin fibers, which are finally condensed into chromosomes during cell division. The correct order is from most condensed to least condensed."
