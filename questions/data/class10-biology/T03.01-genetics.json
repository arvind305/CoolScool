    "text": "Genetics is the study of heredity and variation. Gregor Mendel, the 'Father of Genetics,' used pea plants to discover the laws of inheritance. The Law of Dominance states that in a heterozygote, only the dominant allele is expressed. The Law of Segregation states that alleles separate during gamete formation, with each gamete receiving one allele. The Law of Independent Assortment states that alleles of different genes are inherited independently. A monohybrid cross (one trait) gives a 3:1 phenotypic ratio in F2. A dihybrid cross (two traits) gives a 9:3:3:1 phenotypic ratio in F2. Sex in humans is determined by sex chromosomes (XX = female, XY = male). Sex-linked traits like color blindness and hemophilia are carried on the X chromosome and show different inheritance patterns in males and females.",
