    "text": "Evolution is the gradual change in organisms over generations. Several theories explain the origin of life: special creation (divine origin), spontaneous generation (life from non-living matter - disproved by Pasteur), biogenesis (life from pre-existing life), and chemical evolution (Oparin-Haldane hypothesis - life from simple chemicals). Evidence for evolution includes fossils (paleontological), homologous organs (same origin, different function), analogous organs (different origin, same function), vestigial organs (reduced, non-functional), and embryological similarities. Lamarck proposed inheritance of acquired characters, while Darwin proposed natural selection - organisms with favorable variations survive and reproduce. Human evolution traces from early primates through Australopithecus, Homo habilis, Homo erectus, Neanderthals to modern Homo sapiens. Key developments include bipedalism, increased brain size, and tool use.",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order of steps in the Miller-Urey experiment is: 1) Mixture of CH4, NH3, H2, H2O vapor created, 2) Gases circulated in apparatus, 3) Electric sparks simulated lightning, 4) Amino acids detected. This is the correct sequence because the experiment started by creating a mixture of gases to simulate the early Earth's atmosphere, then the gases were circulated, and electric sparks were used to provide the energy to drive chemical reactions, which ultimately led to the formation of amino acids.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: 1) Amino acids detected, 2) Gases circulated in apparatus, 3) Electric sparks simulated lightning, 4) Mixture of CH4, NH3, H2, H2O vapor created. This is incorrect because the experiment needed to start by creating the simulated atmosphere, then the gases had to be circulated, and the electric sparks had to be applied before the amino acids could be detected as the final result of the experiment."
