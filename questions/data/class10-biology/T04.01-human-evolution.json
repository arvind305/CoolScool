    "text": "Evolution is the gradual change in organisms over generations. Several theories explain the origin of life: special creation (divine origin), spontaneous generation (life from non-living matter - disproved by Pasteur), biogenesis (life from pre-existing life), and chemical evolution (Oparin-Haldane hypothesis - life from simple chemicals). Evidence for evolution includes fossils (paleontological), homologous organs (same origin, different function), analogous organs (different origin, same function), vestigial organs (reduced, non-functional), and embryological similarities. Lamarck proposed inheritance of acquired characters, while Darwin proposed natural selection - organisms with favorable variations survive and reproduce. Human evolution traces from early primates through Australopithecus, Homo habilis, Homo erectus, Neanderthals to modern Homo sapiens. Key developments include bipedalism, increased brain size, and tool use.",

Option D is wrong because the chart clearly shows these species existed at different time periods spanning millions of years."

Lamarck's theory fails because acquired traits (like a blacksmith's muscular arms) are changes to the body (somatic changes) that do not alter the DNA in reproductive cells, so they cannot be passed to the next generation. Modern genetics confirms that only changes in DNA (genes) are heritable.",
