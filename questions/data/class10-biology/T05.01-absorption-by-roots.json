  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Roots absorb water and minerals from the soil through root hairs. Root hairs are unicellular extensions of epidermal cells that increase surface area for absorption. Water is absorbed mainly by osmosis - movement of water from a region of higher water potential (soil) to lower water potential (root cells). Mineral ions are absorbed by active transport, requiring ATP. The absorbed substances move through two pathways: the apoplast pathway (through cell walls and intercellular spaces) and the symplast pathway (through cytoplasm via plasmodesmata). The Casparian strip in the endodermis blocks the apoplast pathway, forcing water and minerals through the symplast. Root pressure pushes water upward and can cause guttation - exudation of water droplets from leaf margins.",
