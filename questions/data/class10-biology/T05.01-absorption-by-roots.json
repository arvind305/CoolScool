    "text": "Roots absorb water and minerals from the soil through root hairs. Root hairs are unicellular extensions of epidermal cells that increase surface area for absorption. Water is absorbed mainly by osmosis - movement of water from a region of higher water potential (soil) to lower water potential (root cells). Mineral ions are absorbed by active transport, requiring ATP. The absorbed substances move through two pathways: the apoplast pathway (through cell walls and intercellular spaces) and the symplast pathway (through cytoplasm via plasmodesmata). The Casparian strip in the endodermis blocks the apoplast pathway, forcing water and minerals through the symplast. Root pressure pushes water upward and can cause guttation - exudation of water droplets from leaf margins.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Water is not primarily absorbed by roots through diffusion, active transport, or facilitated diffusion. Diffusion is the movement of molecules down a concentration gradient, while active transport requires energy expenditure to move substances against a concentration gradient.

The correct answer is osmosis, the passive movement of water from a region of higher to lower water potential."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Guttation does not occur through stomata, lenticels, or root hairs. Stomata are pores on the leaf surface that allow gas exchange, lenticels are openings on the stem for gas exchange, and root hairs are extensions of epidermal cells on roots that increase the surface area for water and mineral absorption. Guttation is specifically the process of water exudation through specialized hydathodes located at the leaf margins."

Root hairs are single-celled extensions of the root's epidermal cells, not structures made up of multiple cells. This misconception may arise from the fact that roots have many root hairs, which can give the impression of being a multicellular structure.

When a respiratory inhibitor like potassium cyanide blocks respiration, ATP production stops and active transport of minerals is severely affected. Water absorption, however, occurs mainly by osmosis (a passive process) driven by water potential differences, so it is only slightly affected by reduced respiration.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Water and mineral absorption do not require respiration equally — water absorption is mainly passive (osmosis). The inhibitor does not directly destroy root hairs; it blocks cellular respiration, which reduces ATP availability. Mineral absorption requires active transport (not osmosis), and it is heavily dependent on ATP, which is why it was most affected."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Dissolved solutes in root hair cell sap lower the water potential inside root cells, which is essential for osmotic water uptake.

It makes the cell walls impermeable to water, blocking the apoplast pathway. However, it cannot block water movement through the living cytoplasm (symplast) of the endodermal cells themselves, because the cell membranes and cytoplasm remain functional. Therefore, water is forced to cross the cell membrane and travel through the symplast.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The Casparian strip does not have pores — it is a continuous waterproof band. The symplast pathway is actually slower than the apoplast, so the strip does not redirect water for speed. The strip blocks all apoplast movement (both water and minerals), not just minerals.

The minerals are still present in the soil, but the roots lack the energy to actively pump them in.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Waterlogging does not wash away all minerals from the soil. Minerals are absorbed by active transport, not osmosis, so dilution is not the primary issue.
