    "text": "Roots absorb water and minerals from the soil through root hairs. Root hairs are unicellular extensions of epidermal cells that increase surface area for absorption. Water is absorbed mainly by osmosis - movement of water from a region of higher water potential (soil) to lower water potential (root cells). Mineral ions are absorbed by active transport, requiring ATP. The absorbed substances move through two pathways: the apoplast pathway (through cell walls and intercellular spaces) and the symplast pathway (through cytoplasm via plasmodesmata). The Casparian strip in the endodermis blocks the apoplast pathway, forcing water and minerals through the symplast. Root pressure pushes water upward and can cause guttation - exudation of water droplets from leaf margins.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Water is not primarily absorbed by roots through diffusion, active transport, or facilitated diffusion. Diffusion is the movement of molecules down a concentration gradient, while active transport requires energy expenditure to move substances against a concentration gradient.

The correct answer is osmosis, the passive movement of water from a region of higher to lower water potential."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Guttation does not occur through stomata, lenticels, or root hairs. Stomata are pores on the leaf surface that allow gas exchange, lenticels are openings on the stem for gas exchange, and root hairs are extensions of epidermal cells on roots that increase the surface area for water and mineral absorption. Guttation is specifically the process of water exudation through specialized hydathodes located at the leaf margins."

Root hairs are single-celled extensions of the root's epidermal cells, not structures made up of multiple cells.

This is because pure water has the highest water potential, followed by soil water, then the cell sap of root hairs, and finally the xylem sap which has the lowest water potential.",

Therefore, the order from highest to lowest water potential is: Pure water, Soil water, Cell sap of root hair, Xylem sap. Pure water has the highest water potential, followed by soil water, then the cell sap of root hairs which has a lower water potential, and finally the xylem sap which has the lowest water potential."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct sequence is: Water is actively absorbed by roots, Transpiration is very low at night, Root pressure builds up, Water exudes from hydathodes. This is because at night, when transpiration is low, the roots continue to actively absorb water, leading to a build-up of root pressure that pushes water out of the leaf hydathodes.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect sequence would be: Transpiration is very low at night, Water is actively absorbed by roots, Root pressure builds up, Water exudes from hydathodes. This is incorrect because the active absorption of water by roots must happen first, before root pressure can build up and push water out of the leaf hydathodes. The low transpiration at night is just a contributing factor that allows root pressure to build up."
