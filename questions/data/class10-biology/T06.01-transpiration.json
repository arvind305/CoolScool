    "text": "Transpiration is the loss of water vapor from aerial parts of plants, mainly through stomata. Stomata are pores bounded by guard cells that regulate their opening and closing. Guard cells open when they become turgid (take up water) due to potassium ion accumulation, and close when flaccid. Stomatal transpiration accounts for 90% of water loss. Factors affecting transpiration include light intensity, temperature, humidity, wind velocity, and water availability. The cohesion-tension theory explains ascent of sap: transpiration creates a pull (tension), and water molecules stick together (cohesion) forming a continuous column from roots to leaves. Transpiration helps in cooling the plant, transporting minerals, and maintaining water flow. Guttation differs from transpiration as it releases liquid water through hydathodes due to root pressure.",

This greater difference in water vapor pressure drives more water to evaporate from the plant's leaves.",

This is because the air around the plant already has a high water vapor content, so there is a smaller difference in water vapor pressure between the plant and the air. Darkness and still air, on the other hand, can actually increase transpiration by reducing the flow of air and reducing the boundary layer around the leaves, both of which can enhance the rate of water evaporation from the plant."

      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is: K+ ions leave guard cells, Water exits guard cells by osmosis, Guard cells become flaccid, Stomata closes. This is because the loss of K+ ions and water causes the guard cells to become flaccid, leading to the closing of the stomatal pore.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Stomata closes, Guard cells become flaccid, K+ ions leave guard cells, Water exits guard cells by osmosis. This is wrong because the stomatal pore cannot close unless the guard cells first lose the K+ ions and water, causing them to become flaccid. The closing of the stomata is the final step in this process."
