    "text": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants convert light energy into chemical energy, producing glucose from carbon dioxide and water while releasing oxygen. The overall equation is: 6CO2 + 6H2O -> C6H12O6 + 6O2. It occurs in chloroplasts, which contain thylakoids (grana) where light reactions occur and stroma where dark reactions occur. The light reaction (Hill reaction) involves absorption of light, photolysis of water (producing O2), and formation of ATP and NADPH. The dark reaction (Calvin cycle) uses ATP and NADPH to fix CO2 into glucose. Factors affecting photosynthesis include light intensity, CO2 concentration, temperature, and water. Blackman's Law of Limiting Factors states that the rate is limited by the factor in shortest supply.",

Photosynthesis does not occur in these other organelles, but specifically in the chloroplasts."

      "question_text": "Meera's science teacher sets up two identical potted plants. Plant A is kept near an open window; Plant B is kept in a sealed glass jar with a dish of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) inside. After a week, leaves from both plants are tested with iodine. Plant A shows blue-black colour but Plant B does not. What does this prove?",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "NaOH absorbs CO2 from the air inside the sealed jar, removing it from Plant B's environment. Both plants had light and water, but Plant B lacked CO2. Since Plant B did not produce starch (no blue-black with iodine) while Plant A did, this proves CO2 is necessary for photosynthesis.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Both plants received light (the jar was glass, so light passed through), so this doesn't test light. Both had water in the soil. Chlorophyll was present in both plants. The only variable was CO2 — NaOH absorbed CO2 in the sealed jar, proving CO2 is essential for photosynthesis."

It uses ATP and NADPH from the light reaction. In practice, the dark reaction mostly occurs during the day when the light reaction provides a continuous supply of ATP and NADPH.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "This is one of the most common misconceptions in photosynthesis. The name 'dark reaction' is misleading — it simply means 'light-independent,' not 'requiring darkness.' The Calvin cycle can and does occur in the light. It would actually stop in prolonged darkness because ATP and NADPH from the light reaction would run out."

Adding more light does not increase the rate because the system has reached its maximum throughput. This is consistent with the concept of enzyme saturation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Chlorophyll is not destroyed by normal high light intensity (though extreme UV can damage it). Plants do not stop absorbing CO2 at high light. While transpiration increases in bright light, this is not the direct cause of the plateau.
