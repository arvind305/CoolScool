    "text": "The circulatory system transports blood throughout the body. Blood consists of plasma (55%), RBCs (carry oxygen via hemoglobin), WBCs (immunity), and platelets (clotting). The heart is a four-chambered muscular organ with two atria and two ventricles, separated by valves. The cardiac cycle consists of systole (contraction) and diastole (relaxation), producing heart sounds 'lub' (AV valves closing) and 'dub' (semilunar valves closing). The SA node (pacemaker) initiates heartbeat. An ECG records the heart's electrical activity with P wave (atrial depolarization), QRS complex (ventricular depolarization), and T wave (ventricular repolarization). Double circulation includes pulmonary (heart-lungs-heart) and systemic (heart-body-heart) circuits. Blood groups (ABO and Rh) determine transfusion compatibility.",

Lymph is a clear fluid that circulates in a separate network of vessels, not part of the blood. Platelets are blood cell fragments that help with clotting, not the liquid part of blood."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Some students may think the right ventricle has thicker walls since it has to pump blood to the lungs, which are further away than the body.

This is because a person with blood type O has no A or B antigens on their red blood cells, but they can receive blood from any other blood type.

They lose their nucleus and other cell organelles during their development to become more compact and flexible for easy circulation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Many students may think that RBCs have a nucleus because most other cells in the body have a nucleus.

This is wrong because the platelets need to first gather at the wound site to start the clotting cascade, which then leads to the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, and finally the thrombin converts fibrinogen to fibrin to create the clot."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The Bundle of His conducts impulses from the AV node to the ventricles — its malfunction would affect the QRS complex, not the P wave. Similarly, Purkinje fiber malfunction would alter ventricular depolarization patterns, not eliminate P waves. The aortic valve is a mechanical structure, not part of the electrical conduction system, so its malfunction would not affect ECG waveforms. Only SA node malfunction explains the absence of P waves."

This is the beginning of pulmonary circulation. In the lungs, carbon dioxide is released and oxygen is absorbed, after which the oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The aorta receives blood from the left ventricle, not the right ventricle. Blood does not flow directly from the right ventricle to the left atrium — it must first pass through the lungs for gas exchange. The superior vena cava is a large vein that brings deoxygenated blood from the upper body to the right atrium; blood does not flow from the ventricle into it. The correct path from the right ventricle is through the pulmonary artery to the lungs."

This complete separation is essential for mammals because they are warm-blooded and have high metabolic rates, requiring a constant and efficient supply of pure oxygenated blood to all body tissues. Without the septum, mixed blood would reduce the oxygen concentration delivered to cells.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The septum does not increase the heart's blood volume — it actually divides the heart into two separate pumps. It does not make blood flow faster, as the speed of blood flow depends on the force of ventricular contraction and the diameter of blood vessels. The septum does not reduce heart weight either. The key reason for the complete septum is functional: preventing the mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood to maintain efficient oxygen delivery for the high metabolic demands of warm-blooded organisms."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "The biconcave disc shape of mature RBCs provides two key advantages: it increases the surface area-to-volume ratio, which allows faster diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide across the cell membrane, and it makes the cells flexible enough to squeeze through narrow capillaries that may be even smaller than the RBC diameter. A spherical shape would reduce the surface area and make the cells too rigid for passage through tiny blood vessels.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The shape of RBCs is not designed for visibility under a microscope — that is an observational consequence, not a biological purpose. RBCs do not store water; they are specialised for gas transport. Their shape is not related to protection from WBCs. The correct reason is functional: the biconcave shape maximises surface area for gas exchange and provides the flexibility needed to navigate through the narrowest capillaries in the circulatory system."

      "explanation_correct": "Veins carry blood back to the heart at relatively low pressure, especially in the limbs where blood must travel against gravity. Without valves, blood would pool in the lower parts of the body due to gravitational pull. The one-way valves in veins ensure that blood flows only towards the heart. Arteries do not need valves because the high pressure generated by ventricular contraction keeps the blood flowing forward continuously.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Most veins carry deoxygenated blood (not oxygenated), so contamination of oxygenated blood is not the reason. Veins are not necessarily closer to the heart than arteries — both extend throughout the body. Valves do not help veins pump blood at high pressure; veins are low-pressure vessels. The correct reason is that veins operate under low pressure and need valves to prevent gravity-induced backflow, while arteries maintain forward flow through the high pressure generated by the heart."
