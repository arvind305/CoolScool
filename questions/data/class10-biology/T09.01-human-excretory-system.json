    "text": "The excretory system removes metabolic wastes from the body. The kidneys are the primary excretory organs, consisting of an outer cortex and inner medulla with collecting pyramids draining into the pelvis. The functional unit is the nephron, comprising Bowman's capsule (containing glomerulus), proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule (DCT), and collecting duct. Urine formation involves three processes: ultrafiltration in the glomerulus (blood filtered under pressure), selective reabsorption in tubules (glucose, amino acids, water reabsorbed), and tubular secretion (H+, K+, ammonia secreted). ADH (antidiuretic hormone) regulates water reabsorption. Dialysis is used when kidneys fail, either hemodialysis (blood filtered externally) or peritoneal dialysis.",

These hormones are involved in regulating blood sugar levels and metabolism, but they do not directly control water reabsorption in the kidneys.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement that each kidney contains about one million nephrons is true. This is because the kidneys are made up of thousands of small units called nephrons, which are responsible for filtering the blood and producing urine.

The excess glucose remains in the tubular fluid and appears in the urine (glycosuria). Riya's blood glucose of 250 mg/dL exceeds this threshold.",

The dialysing fluid in hemodialysis is carefully formulated to have electrolyte concentrations similar to normal blood plasma (sodium, potassium, calcium, chloride, bicarbonate) but contains no waste products like urea, uric acid, or creatinine. Because of this concentration gradient, waste products diffuse from the blood (higher concentration) across the semi-permeable membrane into the dialysing fluid (lower concentration), effectively cleaning the blood.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because if the dialysing fluid contained urea and toxins, waste products could not diffuse out of the blood — they need a concentration gradient. Option C is wrong because the primary purpose is waste removal, not nutrition. Option D is incorrect because dialysis filters blood, not adds cells. The principle of dialysis is diffusion of wastes across a semi-permeable membrane from blood into waste-free fluid."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct answer is C. Drinking excess water actually decreases ADH secretion, not increases it. When large amounts of water are consumed, blood osmolarity drops (blood becomes more dilute), which signals the posterior pituitary gland to reduce ADH release. This makes the collecting duct less permeable to water, producing dilute urine to excrete the excess water. High blood osmolarity, dehydration, and haemorrhage (blood loss) all increase ADH secretion to conserve water.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Options A, B, and D all correctly increase ADH secretion. High blood osmolarity (A) directly stimulates osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus. Dehydration (B) raises blood osmolarity, triggering ADH release. Haemorrhage (D) reduces blood volume, prompting ADH release to retain water. Students commonly mistake excess water intake as a stimulus for ADH, but it is actually the opposite — overhydration suppresses ADH to allow dilute urine excretion."

      "correct_answer": "B",

The process is called 'ultrafiltration' because blood is filtered under very high hydrostatic pressure created by the difference in diameter between the wide afferent arteriole and the narrow efferent arteriole. This pressure forces water, salts, glucose, amino acids, urea, and other small molecules through the fine pores of the glomerular capillary walls and podocytes into Bowman's capsule, while blood cells and large plasma proteins are retained. The prefix 'ultra' refers to this fine, pressure-driven selective filtration.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because ultrafiltration is a physical process driven by pressure, not enzymatic breakdown. Option C is wrong because the filtrate contains many substances (water, glucose, salts, amino acids, urea), not just urea. Option D is incorrect because ultrafiltration occurs under high pressure, not low pressure or gravity.

Even after initial tissue matching, the immune system can mount a rejection response at any time — days, months, or years after surgery. Immunosuppressive drugs suppress this immune response, preventing the T-lymphocytes and antibodies from attacking and destroying the donor kidney. Stopping these drugs would risk acute or chronic rejection.",

Option C is wrong because the transplanted kidney does not need to grow — it functions at its existing size.
