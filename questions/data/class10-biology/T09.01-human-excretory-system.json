    "text": "The excretory system removes metabolic wastes from the body. The kidneys are the primary excretory organs, consisting of an outer cortex and inner medulla with collecting pyramids draining into the pelvis. The functional unit is the nephron, comprising Bowman's capsule (containing glomerulus), proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule (DCT), and collecting duct. Urine formation involves three processes: ultrafiltration in the glomerulus (blood filtered under pressure), selective reabsorption in tubules (glucose, amino acids, water reabsorbed), and tubular secretion (H+, K+, ammonia secreted). ADH (antidiuretic hormone) regulates water reabsorption. Dialysis is used when kidneys fail, either hemodialysis (blood filtered externally) or peritoneal dialysis.",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order of blood vessels associated with the nephron is Renal artery, Afferent arteriole, Glomerulus, Efferent arteriole, and Peritubular capillaries. This is the path that blood takes as it flows through the nephron, starting from the renal artery and ending at the peritubular capillaries.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be something like Renal artery, Glomerulus, Afferent arteriole, Efferent arteriole, Peritubular capillaries. This is not correct because blood first enters the nephron through the afferent arteriole, which then leads to the glomerulus. The efferent arteriole carries blood out of the glomerulus, and the peritubular capillaries are the final step in the blood flow through the nephron."

        "Blood entering kidney"
      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The concentration of urea is highest in the urine, as the kidneys have selectively reabsorbed most other substances from the filtered blood, while retaining and concentrating the urea. The glomerular filtrate has a lower urea concentration than the urine, and the blood entering the kidney has the lowest urea concentration of the three.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to put the blood entering the kidney as having the highest concentration of urea. This is not correct because as blood enters the kidney, it gets filtered in the glomerulus, where a large portion of the urea and other waste products are removed from the blood. The urine, which is the final product of filtration and reabsorption, has the highest concentration of urea, followed by the glomerular filtrate, and then the blood entering the kidney."
