    "text": "The nervous system coordinates body activities through electrical impulses. Neurons (nerve cells) consist of cell body (soma), dendrites (receive impulses), and axon (transmit impulses). The CNS includes brain and spinal cord; PNS includes cranial (12 pairs) and spinal nerves (31 pairs). The brain has three main parts: cerebrum (thinking, memory, voluntary actions), cerebellum (balance, coordination), and medulla oblongata (involuntary actions like breathing). The autonomic nervous system has sympathetic (fight or flight) and parasympathetic (rest and digest) divisions. Reflex actions are quick, automatic responses via reflex arcs. The eye forms images through refraction by cornea and lens, with retina containing rods (dim light) and cones (color). The ear has three parts for hearing (external, middle, inner) with the cochlea for sound detection and vestibular apparatus for balance.",

        "Impulse generated in next neuron"
      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The correct order of events in synaptic transmission is: Impulse arrives at axon terminal, Vesicles release neurotransmitter, Neurotransmitter binds to receptors, Impulse generated in next neuron. This is the sequence in which the electrical signal is converted to a chemical signal and then back to an electrical signal in the next neuron.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Neurotransmitter binds to receptors, Impulse arrives at axon terminal, Vesicles release neurotransmitter, Impulse generated in next neuron. This is wrong because the neurotransmitter can only bind to receptors after it has been released from the vesicles, which happens when the electrical impulse reaches the axon terminal."

        "Medulla oblongata"
      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain, followed by the cerebellum, and then the medulla oblongata. This is because the cerebrum is responsible for higher brain functions like thinking, memory, and voluntary actions, while the cerebellum coordinates balance and movement, and the medulla oblongata controls basic life functions like breathing.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct order from largest to smallest brain parts is: Cerebrum, Cerebellum, Medulla oblongata. Some students may think the medulla oblongata is the largest, but it is actually the smallest of the three main brain parts. The medulla oblongata is responsible for basic life functions like breathing and heart rate, while the cerebrum and cerebellum handle more complex processes."
