    "text": "The nervous system coordinates body activities through electrical impulses. Neurons (nerve cells) consist of cell body (soma), dendrites (receive impulses), and axon (transmit impulses). The CNS includes brain and spinal cord; PNS includes cranial (12 pairs) and spinal nerves (31 pairs). The brain has three main parts: cerebrum (thinking, memory, voluntary actions), cerebellum (balance, coordination), and medulla oblongata (involuntary actions like breathing). The autonomic nervous system has sympathetic (fight or flight) and parasympathetic (rest and digest) divisions. Reflex actions are quick, automatic responses via reflex arcs. The eye forms images through refraction by cornea and lens, with retina containing rods (dim light) and cones (color). The ear has three parts for hearing (external, middle, inner) with the cochlea for sound detection and vestibular apparatus for balance.",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order of events in synaptic transmission is: Impulse arrives at axon terminal, Vesicles release neurotransmitter, Neurotransmitter binds to receptors, Impulse generated in next neuron. This is the sequence in which the electrical signal is converted to a chemical signal and then back to an electrical signal in the next neuron.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Neurotransmitter binds to receptors, Impulse arrives at axon terminal, Vesicles release neurotransmitter, Impulse generated in next neuron. This is wrong because the neurotransmitter can only bind to receptors after it has been released from the vesicles, which happens when the electrical impulse reaches the axon terminal."

      "explanation_correct": "The semicircular canals are three fluid-filled, loop-shaped structures in the inner ear arranged in three planes (horizontal, anterior, and posterior). They detect rotational or angular movements of the head. The constant turning on winding ghat roads causes repeated stimulation of the fluid (endolymph) in these canals, sending conflicting signals to the brain compared to what the eyes see, resulting in motion sickness (dizziness and nausea).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The cochlea (Option A) is the hearing organ and does not detect rotational movement. The ossicles (Option B) are bones in the middle ear that amplify and transmit sound vibrations. The Eustachian tube (Option D) equalises air pressure between the middle ear and the pharynx; it does not detect movement."

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation_correct": "The cerebellum is located at the back of the brain (posterior cranial fossa) and is responsible for coordinating voluntary movements, maintaining balance, and ensuring smooth, precise muscular activity. Damage to the cerebellum results in ataxia — uncoordinated movements, difficulty walking, and loss of balance — exactly matching the symptoms described for Meera's grandfather. His ability to think and speak normally indicates the cerebrum is unaffected.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Damage to the cerebrum (Option A) would impair thinking, memory, speech, or voluntary motor initiation, but his thinking and speech are normal. Damage to the medulla oblongata (Option B) would affect vital involuntary functions like breathing and heartbeat, which could be life-threatening. The hypothalamus (Option C) controls homeostatic functions and hormone regulation; its damage would not specifically cause uncoordinated walking."

Blinking (Option A) and hand withdrawal from heat (Option B) are unconditioned (natural) reflexes, while salivation at the sight of food (Option D) is a conditioned reflex. All three of these are automatic responses that do not require conscious thinking, unlike solving a maths problem.",

The aqueous humour (Option C) is a transparent fluid between the cornea and the lens that also contributes to refraction. Students often confuse the role of the optic nerve with the refractive structures of the eye.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The optic nerve is part of the neural pathway for vision, not the optical/refractive pathway. It carries processed visual information as nerve impulses from the retina to the visual cortex of the brain. It does not bend or focus light in any way.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "The myelin sheath acts as an electrical insulator around the axon, preventing ion exchange across the membrane at myelinated regions. The nerve impulse therefore 'jumps' from one node of Ranvier (gap in the myelin sheath) to the next — a process called saltatory conduction. This jumping mechanism is significantly faster than the continuous point-to-point conduction that occurs in non-myelinated neurons, where the impulse must depolarise every segment of the axon membrane sequentially.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect — the speed difference is not due to neuron length but due to the mode of conduction. Option C is wrong because the number of dendrites does not determine conduction speed along the axon. Option D is incorrect because myelin affects axonal impulse speed, not neurotransmitter strength at the synapse."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "As altitude increases, the atmospheric pressure outside the ear decreases while the pressure in the middle ear remains the same. This unequal pressure across the tympanic membrane (eardrum) restricts its ability to vibrate freely in response to sound waves, causing a feeling of blocked ears and reduced hearing. The Eustachian tube, which connects the middle ear to the pharynx, opens during swallowing or yawning to allow air to enter or leave the middle ear, equalising the pressure and restoring normal hearing.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because the cochlea functions independently of altitude. Option B is incorrect because the semicircular canals detect balance and do not suppress hearing function. Option D is incorrect because the ossicles are bones and do not expand or contract with pressure changes — the issue is with the eardrum and air pressure, not the ossicles themselves."

In voluntary actions, the sensory impulse must travel all the way to the cerebral cortex in the brain, be consciously processed, and then a motor command must be sent back to the muscles — a much longer pathway that takes more time.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because the speed advantage is due to the shorter pathway, not thicker neurons. Option C is wrong because reflex actions absolutely do involve neurons — sensory, relay, and motor neurons form the reflex arc.
