    "text": "The endocrine system consists of ductless glands that secrete hormones directly into the blood. Hormones are chemical messengers that regulate body functions. The hypothalamus links the nervous and endocrine systems. The pituitary gland (master gland) secretes hormones controlling other glands: GH, TSH, ACTH, FSH, LH, ADH, oxytocin. The thyroid produces thyroxine (metabolism) and calcitonin (reduces blood calcium). Parathyroid produces PTH (increases blood calcium). Adrenal glands produce cortisol, aldosterone (cortex), adrenaline (medulla - fight/flight). Pancreatic islets produce insulin (lowers blood sugar) and glucagon (raises blood sugar). Feedback mechanisms regulate hormone levels - negative feedback maintains homeostasis.",

Instead, they release hormones directly into the bloodstream, which allows the hormones to travel throughout the body and regulate various functions.

The hypothalamus produces hormones that signal the pituitary gland to secrete its own hormones, like growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and others.

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is GH (growth hormone from the pituitary gland), Thyroxine (from the thyroid gland), and Cortisol (from the adrenal gland). This is because the pituitary gland is considered the 'master gland' and secretes hormones that control other endocrine glands, including the thyroid and adrenal glands.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Cortisol, GH, Thyroxine. This is wrong because Cortisol is produced by the adrenal gland, not the pituitary gland. The correct order starts with hormones from the pituitary gland (the master gland), then the thyroid gland, and finally the adrenal gland."
