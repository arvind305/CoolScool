    "text": "The endocrine system consists of ductless glands that secrete hormones directly into the blood. Hormones are chemical messengers that regulate body functions. The hypothalamus links the nervous and endocrine systems. The pituitary gland (master gland) secretes hormones controlling other glands: GH, TSH, ACTH, FSH, LH, ADH, oxytocin. The thyroid produces thyroxine (metabolism) and calcitonin (reduces blood calcium). Parathyroid produces PTH (increases blood calcium). Adrenal glands produce cortisol, aldosterone (cortex), adrenaline (medulla - fight/flight). Pancreatic islets produce insulin (lowers blood sugar) and glucagon (raises blood sugar). Feedback mechanisms regulate hormone levels - negative feedback maintains homeostasis.",

Instead, they release hormones directly into the bloodstream, which allows the hormones to travel throughout the body and regulate various functions.

      "explanation_correct": "Endocrine glands do not have ducts. They are ductless glands that release hormones directly into the bloodstream. This allows the hormones to be transported to target tissues and organs throughout the body.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement is false because endocrine glands are ductless. They secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream, unlike exocrine glands which have ducts to release their secretions.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The pituitary gland is not independent, but is actually controlled by the hypothalamus in the brain. The hypothalamus produces hormones that signal the pituitary gland to secrete its own hormones, like growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and others. This close connection between the hypothalamus and pituitary is crucial for maintaining balance in the body's systems."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Some people may think that adrenaline is not released during stressful situations, but this is incorrect. Adrenaline is a key hormone that is secreted by the adrenal glands when the body experiences stress, fear, or other intense emotions.

Her teacher explains that a hormone is released to bring glucose levels back to normal, and once glucose levels drop sufficiently, the release of that hormone also decreases. Which physiological mechanism is Meera's teacher describing?",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "After eating a sugary dessert, blood glucose rises. The pancreas responds by secreting insulin, which promotes glucose uptake by cells and lowers blood glucose. Once glucose returns to normal, the stimulus for insulin release is removed, so insulin secretion decreases. This is negative feedback — the product of the response (lowered glucose) reduces the stimulus (high glucose) that triggered the response. The hormone involved is insulin, not glucagon or adrenaline.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Positive feedback would amplify the response, not return it to normal. Glucagon raises blood glucose and would worsen the situation. Adrenaline is involved in stress responses, not routine blood glucose regulation after meals. The teacher is describing the classic negative feedback loop of insulin: high glucose triggers insulin release, insulin lowers glucose, and low glucose reduces insulin release."

The adrenal gland produces adrenaline (from the medulla), and cortisol and aldosterone (from the cortex). Students often associate thyroxine with the adrenal gland because both are important endocrine hormones, but thyroxine specifically requires iodine and is synthesised only by the thyroid gland in the neck.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Adrenaline (adrenal medulla), cortisol (adrenal cortex), and aldosterone (adrenal cortex) are all genuinely produced by the adrenal gland. Thyroxine, however, is produced by the thyroid gland. It is the exception here because it belongs to a completely different gland despite being frequently studied alongside adrenal hormones."

Its endocrine portion (islets of Langerhans) secretes insulin and glucagon directly into the blood, while its exocrine portion secretes digestive enzymes (like trypsin and lipase) through the pancreatic duct into the duodenum. Students often mistakenly classify the pancreas as purely endocrine because they focus on insulin and glucagon, forgetting its exocrine digestive function.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The thyroid gland, pituitary gland, and adrenal gland are all purely endocrine glands — they secrete hormones directly into the blood and have no exocrine (ducted) function. The pancreas is the exception because it also functions as an exocrine gland by producing digestive enzymes that are released through a duct."

GH, TSH, and ACTH are genuinely synthesised by the anterior pituitary.",

Without dietary iodine, the thyroid cannot synthesise thyroxine. In contrast, adrenal hormones like cortisol and aldosterone are steroid hormones derived from cholesterol, and adrenaline is derived from the amino acid tyrosine — none of these require iodine for their synthesis.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because the need for iodine is about chemical composition, not gland size. Option C is wrong because the thyroid's location has nothing to do with iodine availability from food. Option D is false — the adrenal gland does not store iodine because its hormones simply do not require iodine. The true reason is the biochemical difference: thyroxine incorporates iodine atoms into its structure while adrenal hormones do not."

Although the hypothalamus controls the pituitary via releasing and inhibiting hormones, the pituitary is the direct controller of multiple downstream glands, earning it the title of master gland.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong — the pituitary is actually very small (pea-sized), not the largest gland. Option B has no factual basis; the name is based on function, not history of discovery. Option D is misleading — while the pituitary does produce many hormones, the title 'master gland' specifically refers to its ability to regulate other glands through trophic hormones, not merely the number of hormones it produces."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "During prolonged fasting, blood glucose levels fall because there is no incoming glucose from food. The body needs to maintain a minimum blood glucose level for vital organs like the brain. The alpha cells of the pancreas detect the low blood glucose and respond by secreting glucagon. Glucagon acts on the liver, stimulating the breakdown of stored glycogen into glucose (glycogenolysis), which is then released into the blood. Releasing insulin in this situation would be counterproductive because insulin lowers blood glucose, which is already low.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect — the choice between glucagon and insulin is based on blood glucose levels, not ease of production. Option C is wrong because insulin works on blood glucose regardless of food in the stomach; it is simply not needed when glucose is already low. Option D is incorrect because alpha cell activity is regulated by blood glucose concentration, not by the time of day. The reason is purely physiological: low blood glucose triggers glucagon to restore glucose supply."
