    "text": "The human reproductive system produces gametes and supports the development of offspring. The male system includes testes (produce sperm, testosterone), epididymis (sperm maturation), vas deferens, and accessory glands. The female system includes ovaries (produce ova, estrogen, progesterone), fallopian tubes (site of fertilization), uterus (implantation, fetal development), and vagina. The menstrual cycle (28 days) involves menstrual phase (1-5), follicular phase (6-13, FSH, estrogen), ovulation (day 14, LH surge), and luteal phase (15-28, progesterone from corpus luteum). Fertilization occurs in the fallopian tube; the zygote implants in the uterus. The placenta provides nutrients and gas exchange. Birth control methods include natural, barrier, hormonal, IUDs, and surgical methods. STDs like AIDS are preventable through safe practices.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Some people may think the menstrual cycle is not controlled by hormones, but this is incorrect. The menstrual cycle is a complex process that is regulated by a delicate balance of hormones produced by the ovaries and the pituitary gland in the brain. These hormones control the changes in the ovaries and uterus during the cycle."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The placenta is not formed solely from maternal or fetal tissues alone. It is a combination of both, with the trophoblast cells from the embryo and the uterine lining of the mother coming together to create the placenta.

This estrogen surge triggers the release of luteinizing hormone (LH), leading to ovulation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Some students may think that estrogen levels are highest during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, when progesterone is high. However, estrogen levels actually peak just before ovulation, during the follicular phase, to trigger the LH surge and release of the egg."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Some people may think birth control pills do not prevent ovulation, but this is not correct. The hormones in birth control pills work by stopping the ovaries from releasing an egg each month, which is the key mechanism that prevents pregnancy.

This leads to the menstrual phase and the start of a new menstrual cycle.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to say that the corpus luteum does not degenerate if fertilization does not occur. This is wrong because the corpus luteum requires the presence of the hormone human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) produced by the implanted embryo to continue functioning. Without this signal, the corpus luteum breaks down and stops producing progesterone, leading to the shedding of the uterine lining during menstruation."

This procedure involves cutting and sealing the vas deferens, which are the tubes that carry sperm from the testes to the urethra. This prevents sperm from being released during ejaculation, effectively making the male sterile or unable to reproduce.",
