    "text": "The human reproductive system produces gametes and supports the development of offspring. The male system includes testes (produce sperm, testosterone), epididymis (sperm maturation), vas deferens, and accessory glands. The female system includes ovaries (produce ova, estrogen, progesterone), fallopian tubes (site of fertilization), uterus (implantation, fetal development), and vagina. The menstrual cycle (28 days) involves menstrual phase (1-5), follicular phase (6-13, FSH, estrogen), ovulation (day 14, LH surge), and luteal phase (15-28, progesterone from corpus luteum). Fertilization occurs in the fallopian tube; the zygote implants in the uterus. The placenta provides nutrients and gas exchange. Birth control methods include natural, barrier, hormonal, IUDs, and surgical methods. STDs like AIDS are preventable through safe practices.",

The menstrual cycle is a complex process that is regulated by a delicate balance of hormones produced by the ovaries and the pituitary gland in the brain.

This leads to the menstrual phase and the start of a new menstrual cycle.",

      "explanation_correct": "FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) is secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, not by the ovary. It acts on the ovary to stimulate follicle development, but its source is the pituitary. Estrogen, progesterone, and relaxin are all produced by the ovary (or its structures like the follicle and corpus luteum).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Students often confuse the source and target of reproductive hormones. FSH acts on the ovary but is produced by the pituitary gland. Estrogen is produced by the developing follicle, progesterone by the corpus luteum, and relaxin by the ovary during pregnancy — all are ovarian hormones. FSH is the exception."

Since progesterone is responsible for maintaining the thickened endometrium, the fall in its levels causes the blood vessels in the uterine lining to constrict, leading to the breakdown and shedding of the endometrium — this is menstruation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because while FSH does begin to rise as a new cycle starts, it is not the cause of endometrial shedding. Option C is incorrect because LH does not directly act on the endometrium to cause its breakdown. Option D is wrong because rising estrogen actually builds the uterine lining during the follicular phase; it does not destroy it."

The scrotal position allows for this cooler environment, which is essential for the normal development and viability of sperm.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because the testes need a lower temperature, not a higher one. Option C is wrong because the scrotum actually provides less mechanical protection than the abdominal cavity. Option D is incorrect because the testes do not require direct atmospheric oxygen — they receive oxygen through the blood supply."

Progesterone maintains the endometrium and prevents menstruation, thereby sustaining the pregnancy until the placenta takes over hormone production.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because FSH stimulates follicle development, not corpus luteum maintenance. Option C is incorrect because the placenta does not physically contact the corpus luteum — they are in different locations (uterus vs. ovary). Option D is wrong because while estrogen levels are present, it is specifically hCG from the embryo that rescues the corpus luteum from degeneration."
