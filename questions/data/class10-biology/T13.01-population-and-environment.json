    "text": "Population ecology studies how populations grow and interact with their environment. Population characteristics include size, density, and distribution. Growth rate depends on birth rate, death rate, immigration, and emigration. Populations show J-shaped (exponential) growth when resources are unlimited, and S-shaped (logistic) growth when limited by carrying capacity. Human population has grown exponentially due to improved healthcare, agriculture, and sanitation. Biogeochemical cycles (carbon, nitrogen, water, oxygen) recycle matter through ecosystems. The carbon cycle involves photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition, and fossil fuel combustion. The nitrogen cycle includes nitrogen fixation, nitrification, and denitrification. Biodiversity refers to variety of life at genetic, species, and ecosystem levels. Biodiversity hotspots are regions with high endemic species facing threats.",

Biodiversity includes genetic diversity (the variety of genes within a species), species diversity (the variety of different species), and ecosystem diversity (the variety of different ecosystems like forests, deserts, oceans, etc.).

      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement that in exponential growth, the population grows at a constant rate is incorrect. Exponential growth occurs when a population has unlimited resources and grows at an increasing rate, not a constant rate. This means the population size increases rapidly over time, creating a J-shaped growth curve rather than a linear, constant increase."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Some students may think that Rhizobium bacteria do not have any relationship with leguminous plants. However, this is not true. Rhizobium bacteria form a mutually beneficial symbiotic relationship with legumes, where the bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen and provide it to the plant, while the plant provides the bacteria with carbohydrates produced through photosynthesis."

They have a disproportionately large impact on their environment relative to their abundance. If a keystone species is removed, it disrupts the entire ecosystem, leading to a cascade of changes and potential collapse.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to think that removal of a keystone species does not cause ecosystem collapse. This is wrong because keystone species are essential for maintaining the balance and health of an ecosystem. If a keystone species is removed, it can have devastating effects on the entire ecosystem, leading to a breakdown in the food web, changes in species composition, and potentially the collapse of the entire system."

This means the population is increasing at a faster and faster rate due to improved healthcare, better sanitation, and increased food production through modern agriculture. The population is not limited by resources and is able to grow rapidly without reaching its carrying capacity.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The human population growth has actually slowed down in recent decades and is transitioning towards a logistic or S-shaped growth curve. While the population is still increasing, the growth rate is gradually declining as the population approaches the carrying capacity of the environment. The exponential growth phase was more characteristic of the past centuries when advancements in science and technology enabled rapid population expansion."

Populations cannot grow indefinitely and will eventually reach an equilibrium or carrying capacity due to these limiting factors.",

The factors that limit population growth are called environmental resistance because they restrict or resist the population's ability to grow unchecked. Factors like limited resources, competition, and unfavourable conditions create environmental resistance that prevents the population from growing exponentially and reaching unrestricted levels."
