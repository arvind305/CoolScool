    "text": "Pollution is the introduction of harmful substances into the environment. Air pollution includes particulate matter, SO2, NOx, CO, causing respiratory problems, acid rain, and global warming. Water pollution sources include industrial waste, sewage, and agricultural runoff, causing eutrophication and health hazards. Soil pollution from pesticides, fertilizers, and waste affects soil fertility. Noise pollution affects hearing and causes stress. The greenhouse effect traps heat, causing global warming. Ozone layer depletion by CFCs allows harmful UV radiation. Conservation includes in-situ (national parks, sanctuaries, biosphere reserves) and ex-situ (zoos, gene banks) methods. Sustainable development meets present needs without compromising future generations. The 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) help minimize waste.",

When acid rain falls on marble monuments (which are made of calcium carbonate, CaCO3), the acid reacts with the marble, causing it to corrode and discolour. This phenomenon, sometimes called 'marble cancer', is a well-documented effect of acid rain on the Taj Mahal and other historical structures.",

Global warming raises temperatures but does not melt marble, which requires extremely high temperatures. Eutrophication is a process that occurs in water bodies, not on land monuments.

      "question_text": "Amit lives near a factory in Kanpur. He noticed that residents in his neighbourhood complain of hearing loss and high blood pressure, especially those whose homes face the factory. The factory operates heavy machinery around the clock. What type of pollution is most likely responsible for these health problems?",

      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "The key health effects mentioned — hearing loss and high blood pressure — are characteristic symptoms of prolonged exposure to noise pollution. The factory operates heavy machinery continuously, which generates high decibel levels. Noise above 80 dB over extended periods can cause permanent hearing damage, and chronic noise exposure is linked to stress, hypertension (high blood pressure), and cardiovascular problems. The fact that homes facing the factory are more affected further supports noise pollution as the cause.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Air pollution from factory smoke causes respiratory problems like asthma and bronchitis, not typically hearing loss. Water pollution from effluents causes gastrointestinal diseases and skin problems. Soil pollution affects plant growth and can enter the food chain. The specific symptoms — hearing loss and high blood pressure — and the proximity to heavy machinery point clearly to noise pollution (Option C)."

      "explanation_correct": "Water vapour is actually the most abundant greenhouse gas in the Earth's atmosphere. It absorbs and re-emits infrared radiation, trapping heat just like CO2 and methane. However, students often overlook water vapour as a greenhouse gas because it is not directly emitted by human activities like burning fossil fuels. The textbook typically emphasises CO2, methane, and CFCs, so water vapour is a commonly missed greenhouse gas despite being a significant contributor to the natural greenhouse effect.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2) make up most of the atmosphere but are not greenhouse gases because they do not absorb infrared radiation effectively. Hydrogen (H2) is also not a greenhouse gas. Water vapour (Option C) is the correct answer because it is a potent greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere, even though it is often overlooked in standard lists of greenhouse gases."

Although they might seem like a human-managed or artificial conservation effort (which students sometimes associate with ex-situ methods), they are actually a form of in-situ conservation because the organisms are being protected within their natural habitat. The forest patches are not transplanted or moved — they are conserved right where they naturally occur. In contrast, zoos, seed banks, and botanical gardens are clearly ex-situ because species are maintained away from their natural environment.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Zoological gardens (zoos), seed banks, and botanical gardens are all genuine ex-situ conservation methods where organisms or their genetic material are maintained outside their natural habitats. Sacred groves (Option B) are the exception — even though they may appear to be 'managed' conservation (due to community involvement), the organisms remain in their natural habitat, making this in-situ conservation."

However, when discharged in large quantities into rivers, it causes severe environmental damage through eutrophication, oxygen depletion, and spread of waterborne diseases. Students often assume that because sewage causes serious pollution, it must be non-biodegradable — but biodegradability and environmental harm are separate characteristics. Plastic, mercury, and DDT are all non-biodegradable and persist in the environment for very long periods.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Plastic waste is non-biodegradable and persists in the environment for hundreds of years. Mercury is a toxic heavy metal that is non-biodegradable and accumulates through biomagnification. DDT is a non-biodegradable pesticide that also undergoes biomagnification in food chains. Domestic sewage (Option C) is the exception — it is biodegradable (decomposed by bacteria) yet can cause severe pollution when released in excess, making it a tricky case."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "The ozone layer in the stratosphere absorbs most of the Sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation, particularly UV-B and UV-C. When the ozone layer thins due to CFC-induced depletion, more UV radiation passes through and reaches the Earth's surface. UV radiation has enough energy to damage the DNA in skin cells, causing mutations that can lead to uncontrolled cell division — the basis of skin cancer (melanoma and non-melanoma types). The reason is specifically about UV radiation and DNA damage, not heat or chemical exposure.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Infrared radiation causes heating but is not the primary radiation blocked by the ozone layer, and it does not cause DNA damage leading to cancer. CFCs destroy ozone in the stratosphere but do not fall onto skin. Ozone depletion does not reduce atmospheric oxygen levels — oxygen (O2) and ozone (O3) are different, and the depletion of the ozone layer does not affect breathable oxygen. The correct reason is that UV radiation penetrates the weakened ozone layer and damages DNA in skin cells (Option B)."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "DDT is a non-biodegradable, fat-soluble pesticide that cannot be broken down or excreted easily by organisms. It gets stored in fatty tissues. A top predator, such as a hawk, consumes many smaller organisms over its lifetime, and each of those prey organisms already contains accumulated DDT from the organisms they consumed. Since DDT is not broken down, the total amount of DDT in the predator's body is the sum of DDT from all its prey — leading to progressively higher concentrations at each trophic level. This is the process of biomagnification.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Higher trophic level organisms do not produce DDT — it enters the food chain from agricultural spraying. DDT does not become 'more toxic' as it moves; rather, its concentration increases. Drinking water alone does not explain the dramatic increase in concentration at higher trophic levels. The correct reason (Option B) is that DDT is non-biodegradable, stores in fat, and accumulates because each predator consumes many contaminated prey over its lifetime."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Reduce is the first and most preferred step of the 3Rs because it prevents waste from being created in the first place. When we reduce consumption, no material needs to be collected, transported, or reprocessed. Recycling, while valuable, still requires significant energy, water, and resources to collect, sort, and reprocess waste materials into new products. It also generates some waste and emissions during the reprocessing. Therefore, reducing is more effective because it addresses the problem at its source, before waste is even generated.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "While cost may be a factor, the primary reason is not about being cheaper — it is about preventing waste generation at the source. Recycling is not harmful to the environment; it is beneficial but less effective than reducing because it still consumes energy and resources. Reducing does not produce more goods — it means consuming less. The correct reason (Option B) explains that reducing is more effective because it eliminates waste before it is created, while recycling still requires resource-intensive reprocessing."
