    "text": "Pollution is the introduction of harmful substances into the environment. Air pollution includes particulate matter, SO2, NOx, CO, causing respiratory problems, acid rain, and global warming. Water pollution sources include industrial waste, sewage, and agricultural runoff, causing eutrophication and health hazards. Soil pollution from pesticides, fertilizers, and waste affects soil fertility. Noise pollution affects hearing and causes stress. The greenhouse effect traps heat, causing global warming. Ozone layer depletion by CFCs allows harmful UV radiation. Conservation includes in-situ (national parks, sanctuaries, biosphere reserves) and ex-situ (zoos, gene banks) methods. Sustainable development meets present needs without compromising future generations. The 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) help minimize waste.",

      "correct_answer": true,
      "explanation_correct": "CFCs (Chlorofluorocarbons) are chemicals that were commonly used in refrigerators and air conditioners. When released into the atmosphere, CFCs break down the ozone layer, which normally protects us from harmful UV radiation from the sun. This leads to increased risk of skin cancer and other health problems.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Some people may think that CFCs do not deplete the ozone layer, but this is incorrect. CFCs are very harmful chemicals that break down the ozone layer in the Earth's atmosphere. This allows more UV radiation from the sun to reach the Earth's surface, which can cause serious health problems like skin cancer."

      "explanation_correct": "Acid rain has a pH below 5.6 because the rain becomes acidic due to the presence of dissolved sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the atmosphere. These air pollutants react with water in the air to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3), lowering the pH of the rain.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement that acid rain has a pH below 5.6 is true. Acid rain is considered to have a pH below 5.6 because normal rain has a slightly acidic pH of around 5.6 due to the natural presence of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere. When air pollutants like SO2 and NOx are added, they react with water to form stronger acids, lowering the pH of the rain further."
