      "explanation_correct": "The order of increasing electronegativity is C, N, O, F because as you move across a period (row) in the periodic table, electronegativity increases. This is because the atomic radius decreases, and the attraction between the nucleus and the valence electrons becomes stronger.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be O, N, C, F. This is because electronegativity generally decreases as you move down a group (column) in the periodic table, not across a period. The correct order from lowest to highest electronegativity is C, N, O, F."

Therefore, the order of decreasing metallic character is Na, Mg, Al, Si, as sodium is the most metallic and silicon is the least metallic among these elements.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Si, Al, Mg, Na. This is because the metallic character decreases across a period, not increases. Sodium (Na) is the most metallic, followed by magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), and silicon (Si) being the least metallic."
