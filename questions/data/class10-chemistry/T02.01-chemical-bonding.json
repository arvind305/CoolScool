    "text": "Chemical bonding is the force that holds atoms together in compounds. The octet rule states that atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons to achieve 8 electrons in their outermost shell. Electrovalent (ionic) bonds form when electrons are transferred from a metal to a non-metal, creating ions that attract each other. Covalent bonds form when non-metals share electron pairs. Single bonds share one pair, double bonds share two pairs, and triple bonds share three pairs. Coordinate (dative) bonds form when both shared electrons come from one atom. Ionic compounds have high melting points and conduct electricity when molten, while covalent compounds generally have low melting points and do not conduct electricity.",

It also does not involve mutual sharing of electrons or no exchange of electrons. Electrovalent bonds are specifically formed when a metal completely transfers one or more electrons to a non-metal, creating positively and negatively charged ions that are attracted to each other."
