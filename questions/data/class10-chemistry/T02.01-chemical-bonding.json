    "text": "Chemical bonding is the force that holds atoms together in compounds. The octet rule states that atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons to achieve 8 electrons in their outermost shell. Electrovalent (ionic) bonds form when electrons are transferred from a metal to a non-metal, creating ions that attract each other. Covalent bonds form when non-metals share electron pairs. Single bonds share one pair, double bonds share two pairs, and triple bonds share three pairs. Coordinate (dative) bonds form when both shared electrons come from one atom. Ionic compounds have high melting points and conduct electricity when molten, while covalent compounds generally have low melting points and do not conduct electricity.",

It also does not involve mutual sharing of electrons or no exchange of electrons. Electrovalent bonds are specifically formed when a metal completely transfers one or more electrons to a non-metal, creating positively and negatively charged ions that are attracted to each other."

      "explanation_correct": "The melting point increases from CH4 to NaCl to MgO because the strength of the chemical bonds increases in that order. CH4 has only weak van der Waals forces between the molecules, NaCl has strong ionic bonds between the Na+ and Cl- ions, and MgO has the strongest ionic bonds between the Mg2+ and O2- ions, requiring the most energy to break them apart.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be NaCl, CH4, MgO. This is wrong because NaCl has strong ionic bonds that require more energy to break apart compared to the weak van der Waals forces in CH4. MgO has the strongest ionic bonds of the three and therefore the highest melting point."

This is because as the number of protons in the nucleus increases, the positive charge also increases, which causes the electron cloud to be pulled in more tightly, resulting in a smaller ion size. Therefore, the Al3+ ion is the smallest, followed by the Mg2+ ion and then the Na+ ion.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Na+, Mg2+, Al3+. This is because the size of an ion is determined by the number of protons and electrons it has. As the number of protons increases, the size of the ion decreases. However, the incorrect order suggests that the size of the ion increases as the number of protons increases, which is not correct. The correct order is Al3+, Mg2+, Na+ because the Al3+ ion has the smallest size, followed by the Mg2+ ion and then the Na+ ion."

This is incorrect because KBr and NaCl are both ionic compounds that conduct electricity in the molten state, with KBr having a higher conductivity than NaCl.

This is because as the difference in electronegativity between the atoms increases, the polarity of the bond also increases. Hydrogen has the lowest electronegativity, so the H-H bond is the least polar. The electronegativity difference increases from H-C to H-Cl to H-F, making the bonds more polar in that order.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be H-H, H-Cl, H-C, H-F. This is incorrect because the electronegativity difference between H and Cl is greater than the difference between H and C, so the H-Cl bond is more polar than the H-C bond.
