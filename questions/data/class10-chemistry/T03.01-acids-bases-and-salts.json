    "text": "According to Arrhenius theory, acids produce H+ ions and bases produce OH- ions in aqueous solution. Bronsted-Lowry theory defines acids as proton donors and bases as proton acceptors. Strong acids and bases ionize completely, while weak acids and bases ionize partially. The pH scale (0-14) measures the concentration of H+ ions; pH < 7 is acidic, pH = 7 is neutral, and pH > 7 is basic. Neutralization reactions produce salts and water. Salts can be normal, acidic, or basic depending on the parent acid and base. Indicators like litmus, phenolphthalein, and methyl orange show different colors in acids and bases.",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order from lowest to highest pH is: Lemon juice (acidic), Pure water (neutral), Blood (slightly basic), Soap solution (basic). This is because lemon juice contains citric acid which has a low pH, while soap solution is basic and has a high pH.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Lemon juice, Blood, Pure water, Soap solution. This is wrong because blood has a slightly basic pH around 7.4, which is higher than the neutral pH of pure water at 7. Soap solution, being a basic substance, should have the highest pH among the given options."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be HCl, H2CO3, CH3COOH, HNO3. This is wrong because HCl is a stronger acid than carbonic acid (H2CO3), and nitric acid (HNO3) is the strongest acid in the list. The correct order is based on the extent of ionization and release of H+ ions in water, with stronger acids having a greater ability to donate protons."
