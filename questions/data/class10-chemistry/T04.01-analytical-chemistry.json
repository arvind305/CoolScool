Dry tests include observing the color of the salt and performing flame tests: sodium gives golden yellow, potassium gives lilac, calcium gives brick red, and copper gives bluish green. Wet tests involve adding NaOH or NH4OH to salt solutions and observing precipitate colors and solubility in excess reagent. Anion tests include: carbonates give effervescence with dilute acid and turn lime water milky; sulphates give white precipitate with BaCl2; chlorides give white curdy precipitate with AgNO3 that is soluble in NH4OH.",

Ferrous sulphate (FeSO4.7H2O) is a common pale green salt.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Copper sulphate is blue, not pale green. Ferric chloride is yellow-brown and gives a reddish-brown precipitate with NaOH that does not turn brown on standing (already Fe3+). Zinc sulphate is white and gives a white precipitate with NaOH. Only ferrous sulphate matches: pale green colour, green precipitate turning brown, and Turnbull's blue with K4[Fe(CN)6]."

While AgCl is insoluble in dilute HNO3 and BaSO4 is also insoluble in dilute HNO3, BaCO3 dissolves in dilute HNO3 because the carbonate reacts with the acid: BaCO3 + 2HNO3 -> Ba(NO3)2 + H2O + CO2. This is why the sulphate test requires checking insolubility in dilute HNO3 to rule out carbonate.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Students may assume all white precipitates from anion tests are insoluble in dilute acids. However, BaCO3 is a carbonate that reacts with dilute acids (including HNO3), releasing CO2 and dissolving. BaSO4 is extremely stable and insoluble.

      "explanation_incorrect": "Not all metals give golden yellow flames — each metal has its characteristic colour. The Bunsen burner flame in the non-luminous mode is blue, not golden yellow. Sodium gives golden yellow while potassium gives lilac — they are different. The real reason is sodium contamination as an impurity."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The solubility in water is not the relevant factor — both are insoluble in water. Cu(OH)2 does not decompose under these conditions. Zinc does not displace sodium — this is not a displacement reaction. The key reason is the amphoteric nature of Zn(OH)2, which allows it to react with excess alkali."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The speed of reaction is not the reason for choosing HNO3. BaCl2 does not precipitate from additional Cl- ions. While HNO3 is a strong acid like HCl, the reason is not about acid strength.
