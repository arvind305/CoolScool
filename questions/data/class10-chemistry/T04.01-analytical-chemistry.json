    "text": "Analytical chemistry involves the identification of cations and anions in salts through systematic tests. Dry tests include observing the color of the salt and performing flame tests: sodium gives golden yellow, potassium gives lilac, calcium gives brick red, and copper gives bluish green. Wet tests involve adding NaOH or NH4OH to salt solutions and observing precipitate colors and solubility in excess reagent. Anion tests include: carbonates give effervescence with dilute acid and turn lime water milky; sulphates give white precipitate with BaCl2; chlorides give white curdy precipitate with AgNO3 that is soluble in NH4OH.",

        "Gas turns lime water milky"
      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The correct order of the carbonate test steps is: Add dilute HCl to the salt, observe effervescence, pass the gas through lime water, and see the lime water turn milky. This is because the carbonate salt reacts with dilute acid to produce a gas, which is then bubbled through lime water to test for its identity.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Pass gas through lime water, gas turns lime water milky, add dilute HCl to salt, effervescence observed. This is wrong because the effervescence (gas production) must occur first when the acid is added to the salt, and then the gas can be passed through the lime water to test for its identity."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Add AgNO3 solution, white curdy precipitate forms, white curdy precipitate dissolves, add excess NH4OH. This is wrong because the white precipitate should not dissolve before adding the excess NH4OH, which is what causes the precipitate to dissolve and become soluble again."
