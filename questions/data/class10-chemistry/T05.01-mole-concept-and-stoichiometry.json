    "text": "The mole is the SI unit for amount of substance. One mole contains 6.022 x 10^23 particles (Avogadro's number). The molar mass is the mass of one mole in grams, numerically equal to the relative molecular mass. At STP (0C, 1 atm), one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L (molar volume). Key relationships: moles = mass/molar mass = number of particles/Avogadro's number = volume at STP/22.4. Stoichiometry uses balanced equations to calculate masses, moles, and volumes of reactants and products. Percentage composition gives the mass percent of each element in a compound. Empirical formula shows the simplest ratio, while molecular formula shows actual number of atoms.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "According to Avogadro's law, at a given temperature and pressure, equal volumes of gases contain equal numbers of molecules. Since 1 mole of any gas contains 6.022 x 10^23 molecules, and the volume of an ideal gas depends on the number of molecules (not their mass or size), both N2 and CO2 occupy 22.4 L at STP.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because N2 and CO2 molecules are not the same size, yet they still occupy the same molar volume. Option C is wrong because occupying the same molar volume is a physical property of all ideal gases, not a result of similar chemical properties. Option D is wrong because N2 (density 1.25 g/L) and CO2 (density 1.96 g/L) have different densities at STP."

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "The empirical formula represents the simplest whole number ratio of atoms, not the actual number. Acetic acid (C2H4O2) simplifies to CH2O (divide by 2), and glucose (C6H12O6) also simplifies to CH2O (divide by 6). Since the empirical formula discards information about the actual molecular size, different compounds with molecular formulas that are different multiples of the same simplest ratio will share the same empirical formula.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because acetic acid (60 g/mol) and glucose (180 g/mol) have very different molecular masses. Option C is wrong because having the same empirical formula does not make two compounds identical; they differ in molecular formula, structure, and properties. Option D is wrong because the empirical formula explicitly does not show the exact number of atoms; that is the molecular formula."
