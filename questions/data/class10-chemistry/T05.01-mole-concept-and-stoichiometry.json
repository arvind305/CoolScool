    "text": "The mole is the SI unit for amount of substance. One mole contains 6.022 x 10^23 particles (Avogadro's number). The molar mass is the mass of one mole in grams, numerically equal to the relative molecular mass. At STP (0C, 1 atm), one mole of any gas occupies 22.4 L (molar volume). Key relationships: moles = mass/molar mass = number of particles/Avogadro's number = volume at STP/22.4. Stoichiometry uses balanced equations to calculate masses, moles, and volumes of reactants and products. Percentage composition gives the mass percent of each element in a compound. Empirical formula shows the simplest ratio, while molecular formula shows actual number of atoms.",

      "correct_answer": "2",
      "explanation_correct": "The mole ratio of N2 to NH3 is 1:2 because the balanced equation shows that 1 mole of N2 reacts with 3 moles of H2 to produce 2 moles of NH3. This is the simplest whole-number ratio between the reactant N2 and the product NH3.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is a single number, so the correct answer is '2'. The incorrect answer could be thinking that the mole ratio is 1:1, since 1 mole of N2 reacts. However, the balanced equation shows that 2 moles of NH3 are produced for every 1 mole of N2 consumed, so the correct mole ratio is 1:2."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The molecular formula is not the same as the empirical formula. The empirical formula shows the simplest ratio of atoms in a compound, while the molecular formula shows the actual number of atoms in a molecule.

      "correct_answer": "0.5",
      "explanation_correct": "The question states that 3.011 x 10^23 molecules represent a certain number of moles. Since one mole contains 6.022 x 10^23 particles, 3.011 x 10^23 molecules would represent half a mole (0.5 mole).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 0.5 mole. The question is asking how many moles are represented by 3.011 x 10^23 molecules. To calculate this, we need to divide the number of molecules (3.011 x 10^23) by Avogadro's number (6.022 x 10^23), which gives us 0.5 mole. This is because one mole contains 6.022 x 10^23 particles, so half of that number (3.011 x 10^23) would represent 0.5 mole."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The gram atomic mass of oxygen is NOT 12 g. This is a common mistake because the atomic mass of carbon is 12.01 g/mol. However, the atomic mass of oxygen is 16.00 g/mol, so the correct gram atomic mass of oxygen is 16 g."

This is because the molar mass decreases in the order CO2 > H2O > O2 > H2, so the number of molecules increases in the opposite order.
