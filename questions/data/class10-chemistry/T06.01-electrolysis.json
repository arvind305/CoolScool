    "text": "Electrolysis is the decomposition of an ionic compound by passing electric current through it in molten or aqueous state. Electrolytes are substances that conduct electricity when molten or dissolved; strong electrolytes ionize completely, weak electrolytes ionize partially. During electrolysis, cations migrate to the cathode (negative electrode) where reduction occurs, and anions migrate to the anode (positive electrode) where oxidation occurs. Key electrolyses include: molten PbBr2 produces Pb at cathode and Br2 at anode; acidified water produces H2 at cathode and O2 at anode in 2:1 ratio; CuSO4 with copper electrodes results in copper transfer from anode to cathode.",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is: Current passes through electrolyte -> Ions migrate to electrodes -> Ions reach electrodes -> Chemical reaction at electrodes. This is because first the electric current must pass through the electrolyte to create the driving force for the ions to migrate, then the ions move towards the electrodes, and finally the chemical reactions occur at the electrodes.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Ions reach electrodes -> Ions migrate to electrodes -> Current passes through electrolyte -> Chemical reaction at electrodes. This is wrong because the ions cannot reach the electrodes before the electric current has passed through the electrolyte to create the driving force for the ions to move. The ions must first migrate to the electrodes after the current has been established in the electrolyte."

Weak electrolytes like acetic acid partially ionize, producing fewer ions, so they have lower conductivity. Pure water and non-electrolytes like sugar do not contain ions, so they have the lowest conductivity.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The order of decreasing conductivity is: strong electrolyte, weak electrolyte, pure water, non-electrolyte. Strong electrolytes like NaCl fully ionize and have the highest number of freely moving ions, so they conduct electricity the best. Weak electrolytes like acetic acid partially ionize, so they have lower conductivity. Pure water contains some ions from self-ionization, so it has higher conductivity than a non-electrolyte like sugar, which does not contain any ions."

Oxygen gas (O2) is produced at the anode (positive electrode) through the oxidation of water. The volume ratio of hydrogen to oxygen is 2:1, as for every 2 molecules of hydrogen produced, 1 molecule of oxygen is produced.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to list oxygen (O2) at the cathode, hydrogen (H2) at the anode, and a volume ratio that is not 2:1. This is incorrect because during electrolysis, the cations (positively charged ions) are attracted to the cathode and undergo reduction, while the anions (negatively charged ions) are attracted to the anode and undergo oxidation. In the case of acidified water, the cations are hydrogen ions (H+) which are reduced to form hydrogen gas (H2) at the cathode, while the anions are hydroxide ions (OH-) which are oxidized to form oxygen gas (O2) at the anode. The volume ratio of 2:1 for hydrogen to oxygen is due to the balanced chemical reaction that occurs during the electrolysis of water."
