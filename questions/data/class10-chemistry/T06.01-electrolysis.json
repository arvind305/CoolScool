    "text": "Electrolysis is the decomposition of an ionic compound by passing electric current through it in molten or aqueous state. Electrolytes are substances that conduct electricity when molten or dissolved; strong electrolytes ionize completely, weak electrolytes ionize partially. During electrolysis, cations migrate to the cathode (negative electrode) where reduction occurs, and anions migrate to the anode (positive electrode) where oxidation occurs. Key electrolyses include: molten PbBr2 produces Pb at cathode and Br2 at anode; acidified water produces H2 at cathode and O2 at anode in 2:1 ratio; CuSO4 with copper electrodes results in copper transfer from anode to cathode.",
