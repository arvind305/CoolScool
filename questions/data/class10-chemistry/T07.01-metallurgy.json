    "text": "Metallurgy is the science of extracting metals from their ores. An ore is a mineral from which metal can be extracted profitably. Metals are extracted based on their position in the reactivity series: highly reactive metals (Na, Al) are extracted by electrolysis, medium reactive metals (Fe, Zn) by reduction with carbon, and less reactive metals (Cu, Hg) by roasting. Iron is extracted in a blast furnace using haematite, coke, and limestone. Aluminium is extracted by electrolysis of Al2O3 in molten cryolite (Hall-Heroult process). Alloys are homogeneous mixtures of metals that improve properties. Corrosion (rusting) requires air and moisture; prevention methods include painting, galvanizing, and alloying.",

      "explanation_correct": "The given alloys are arranged in increasing order of iron content as follows: Bronze (no iron), Brass (no iron), Stainless steel (contains iron), Steel (highest iron content). This is because Bronze is a copper-tin alloy, Brass is a copper-zinc alloy, Stainless steel is an iron-chromium alloy, and Steel is an iron-carbon alloy with the highest iron content.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Bronze, Brass, Steel, Stainless steel. This is incorrect because Bronze and Brass do not contain any iron, while Stainless steel contains more iron than regular Steel. Steel has the highest iron content among the given alloys."

      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The correct order from most to least effective for preventing corrosion is: Oiling, Painting, Galvanizing, Alloying (stainless steel). Oiling forms a protective coating that blocks air and moisture, making it the most effective. Painting also creates a barrier, while galvanizing uses a sacrificial zinc coating. Alloying is less effective as it only makes the metal more resistant to corrosion, but does not completely prevent it.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Galvanizing, Oiling, Painting, Alloying (stainless steel). This is incorrect because oiling is the most effective method, as it forms a protective coating that blocks air and moisture - the two key ingredients for corrosion. Galvanizing, while effective, is not as good as oiling. Painting and alloying are less effective overall compared to oiling and galvanizing."
