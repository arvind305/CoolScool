    "text": "Metallurgy is the science of extracting metals from their ores. An ore is a mineral from which metal can be extracted profitably. Metals are extracted based on their position in the reactivity series: highly reactive metals (Na, Al) are extracted by electrolysis, medium reactive metals (Fe, Zn) by reduction with carbon, and less reactive metals (Cu, Hg) by roasting. Iron is extracted in a blast furnace using haematite, coke, and limestone. Aluminium is extracted by electrolysis of Al2O3 in molten cryolite (Hall-Heroult process). Alloys are homogeneous mixtures of metals that improve properties. Corrosion (rusting) requires air and moisture; prevention methods include painting, galvanizing, and alloying.",

      "explanation_correct": "The goldsmith is applying the concept of alloying. An alloy is a homogeneous mixture of two or more metals (or a metal with a non-metal). By mixing gold with copper or silver, the resulting alloy becomes harder and more durable than pure gold, making it suitable for making jewellery that can withstand daily wear. This is why jewellery is commonly made from 22 carat or 18 carat gold rather than pure 24 carat gold.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Galvanization involves coating iron with zinc, not mixing gold with other metals. Electroplating deposits a thin layer of metal using electricity, which is different from mixing metals together. Smelting is the process of extracting metal from its ore. None of these describe the mixing of gold with other metals to improve its properties."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "The method described is froth flotation. In this process, crushed sulphide ore is mixed with water and a frothing agent like pine oil. When air is blown through the mixture, the sulphide ore particles become coated with oil, attach to air bubbles, and float to the surface as froth, while the gangue (rocky impurities) sinks. This method exploits the difference in wettability between the ore and gangue.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Magnetic separation uses magnets to separate magnetic ore from non-magnetic gangue and is used for iron ores, not copper sulphide. Gravity separation separates based on density differences without using oil or air. Leaching involves dissolving the ore in a chemical solution, not floating it. The use of water, pine oil, and air bubbles is characteristic of froth flotation."

Electrolysis provides the large amount of electrical energy needed to decompose these very stable compounds.",

Zinc, being more reactive, preferentially loses electrons and corrodes instead of iron. This is called sacrificial protection. The zinc acts as a sacrificial anode, protecting the iron cathode from rusting even at the exposed scratch.",

Option B is wrong because zinc is actually more reactive than iron, not less; if it were less reactive, it would not provide sacrificial protection.
