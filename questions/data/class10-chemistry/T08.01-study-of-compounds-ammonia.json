    "text": "Ammonia (NH3) is a colorless gas with a characteristic pungent smell. In the laboratory, it is prepared by heating an ammonium salt with a base: NH4Cl + NaOH -> NaCl + H2O + NH3. It is dried using quicklime (CaO), not concentrated H2SO4. Industrially, ammonia is manufactured by the Haber process: N2 + 3H2 <-> 2NH3, at 450-500C, 200-300 atm, using iron catalyst. Ammonia is highly soluble in water (fountain experiment), turns red litmus blue, forms white fumes with HCl (NH4Cl), and acts as a reducing agent. It is used in fertilizers, manufacture of nitric acid, and as a refrigerant.",

This is because you first need to heat the mixture to produce ammonia gas, then pass it through a delivery tube, dry it using quicklime, and finally collect the dry ammonia gas by downward displacement of air.",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order of the conditions for the Haber process is: 450-500°C, 200-300 atm, Iron catalyst. This is because the high temperature of 450-500°C is required to provide the necessary activation energy for the reaction to proceed, the high pressure of 200-300 atm shifts the equilibrium towards the product side (as per Le Chatelier's principle), and the iron catalyst is used to increase the rate of the reaction.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: 200-300 atm, Iron catalyst, 450-500°C. This is not correct because the temperature of 450-500°C is the most important factor in the Haber process, as it provides the activation energy needed for the reaction to take place. The pressure and the catalyst are also important, but they are not as crucial as the temperature in determining the success of the Haber process."
