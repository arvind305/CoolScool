    "text": "Nitric acid (HNO3) is prepared in the laboratory by heating a nitrate salt with concentrated H2SO4 below 200C. Industrially, it is manufactured by the Ostwald process: 4NH3 + 5O2 -> 4NO + 6H2O (with Pt-Rh catalyst at 800C), then 2NO + O2 -> 2NO2, and finally 4NO2 + O2 + 2H2O -> 4HNO3. Pure HNO3 is colorless but turns yellow on standing due to decomposition to NO2. It is a strong oxidizing acid. Concentrated HNO3 makes Al and Fe passive. Aqua regia (3HCl + HNO3) dissolves gold and platinum.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: NO2 reacts with O2 and H2O to form HNO3, NH3 oxidized to NO, and NO oxidized to NO2. This is incorrect because the Ostwald process starts with the oxidation of ammonia (NH3) to nitric oxide (NO), then NO is further oxidized to nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and finally NO2 reacts with oxygen and water to produce nitric acid (HNO3)."

This sequence makes sense because heating the mixture of NaNO3 and H2SO4 causes the HNO3 to vaporize, which is then condensed and collected.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: 1) HNO3 distills over, 2) NaNO3 + conc. H2SO4 added to flask, 3) Mixture heated gently, 4) HNO3 collected in receiver. This is wrong because the HNO3 cannot distill over before the reactants (NaNO3 and H2SO4) have been added to the flask and heated. The correct sequence is to first add the reactants, then heat them to produce the HNO3 vapor, which is then condensed and collected."

This combination of conditions allows the reaction to proceed efficiently and produce nitric acid effectively.",

The high temperature of around 800°C is necessary to drive the reaction forward, while the low pressure environment helps to shift the equilibrium in the desired direction. The Pt-Rh catalyst is also crucial, as it helps to speed up the reaction and improve the yield of nitric acid."
