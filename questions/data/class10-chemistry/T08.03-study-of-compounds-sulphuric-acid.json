Step 1: S + O2 -> SO2 (burning sulphur); Step 2: 2SO2 + O2 -> 2SO3 (V2O5 catalyst at 450C); Step 3: SO3 + H2SO4 -> H2S2O7 (oleum); Step 4: H2S2O7 + H2O -> 2H2SO4. H2SO4 is a colorless, viscous, oily liquid with high boiling point (338C). It has three important properties: acidic (reacts with bases), dehydrating (chars sugar), and oxidizing (oxidizes metals). When diluting, always add acid to water. Test: BaCl2 gives white precipitate of BaSO4.",

If SO3 were dissolved directly in water, it would react vigorously and form a fine mist of H2SO4 droplets that are extremely difficult to condense and collect. Instead, SO3 is absorbed in concentrated H2SO4 to form oleum (H2S2O7), which is then safely diluted with water.",

The problem is that this reaction is so vigorous that it produces an uncondensable mist of H2SO4 droplets rather than a collectible liquid. SO3 does not decompose in water and does not react explosively — the issue is purely the impractical mist formation."

By adding acid to water, the heat is distributed over a large volume of water, preventing dangerous splattering.",

A moderate temperature of 450°C is used as a compromise — high enough for a reasonable rate of reaction (with V2O5 catalyst) but not so high as to reduce the yield significantly. Excess oxygen shifts equilibrium forward, and the catalyst speeds up the attainment of equilibrium.",
