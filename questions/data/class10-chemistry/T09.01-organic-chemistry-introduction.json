    "text": "Organic chemistry is the study of carbon compounds. Carbon's unique properties include tetravalency (forms 4 bonds) and catenation (ability to form long chains). A homologous series is a family of organic compounds with the same functional group, differing by CH2. Common functional groups include: -OH (alcohol), -CHO (aldehyde), -COOH (carboxylic acid), -CO- (ketone), and -X (halogen). IUPAC naming follows: prefix (substituents) + root (carbon chain length) + suffix (functional group). Structural isomers have the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements.",
