      "explanation_correct": "Amit's gas is ethene (C2H4), which is an alkene with a C=C double bond. When ethene reacts with bromine water, it undergoes an addition reaction where Br2 molecules add across the double bond: C2H4 + Br2 -> C2H4Br2 (1,2-dibromoethane). This addition consumes the dissolved bromine, causing the orange-brown colour to disappear.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Substitution reactions involve replacing one atom with another and are characteristic of saturated hydrocarbons (alkanes), not alkenes. Decomposition involves breaking a compound into simpler substances, which is not what happens here. Displacement involves one element replacing another in a compound. The decolorization of bromine water by an alkene is a classic example of an addition reaction across the C=C double bond."

Two key clues from Priya's observation confirm this: (1) the gas is made from calcium carbide and water (CaC2 + 2H2O -> C2H2 + Ca(OH)2), and (2) it produces a very hot flame used for cutting metal. Ethyne is used in oxy-acetylene welding and cutting because it burns with an extremely hot flame (around 3300°C).",

Propane is obtained from natural gas or petroleum refining, not from calcium carbide. Only ethyne (acetylene) is prepared from calcium carbide and water, and it is the gas used in oxy-acetylene welding torches."

In the presence of sunlight (which provides the energy to break Cl2 into chlorine radicals), a hydrogen atom in methane is replaced by a chlorine atom: CH4 + Cl2 -> CH3Cl + HCl. The fading of the greenish-yellow colour occurs because chlorine gas is being consumed in the reaction.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Addition reactions require unsaturated hydrocarbons with double or triple bonds, which methane does not have. Polymerization involves joining many small molecules together, not reacting with halogens. Combustion would require oxygen and would produce CO2 and H2O.

A clean blue flame is characteristic of complete combustion with sufficient oxygen.",

It is prepared from calcium carbide and water (CaC2 + 2H2O -> C2H2 + Ca(OH)2), its formula is C2H2, and it does contain a C≡C triple bond.

Dilute H2SO4 contains too much water itself to act as an effective dehydrating agent.",
