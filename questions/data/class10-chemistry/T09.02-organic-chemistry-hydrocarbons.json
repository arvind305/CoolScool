      "explanation_correct": "The correct order of increasing boiling point for the given alkanes is CH4, C2H6, C3H8, C4H10. This is because as the number of carbon atoms increases, the molecular size and intermolecular forces also increase, leading to higher boiling points.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be C3H8, CH4, C4H10, C2H6. This is wrong because the boiling point of alkanes increases with the number of carbon atoms, not the order of the chemical formulas. Methane (CH4) has the lowest boiling point, followed by ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), and butane (C4H10)."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct answer is Ethanol heated with conc. H2SO4, Temperature at 170C, Water removed, Ethene collected. This is the correct sequence of steps because the concentrated sulfuric acid acts as a dehydrating agent, removing water from ethanol to produce ethene at a temperature of 170°C.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect explanation would be: Ethene is collected first, then the temperature is set to 170°C, followed by removing water, and finally heating ethanol with concentrated sulfuric acid. This is incorrect because the dehydration of ethanol to form ethene occurs when ethanol is heated with concentrated sulfuric acid at 170°C, and the ethene produced is then collected as the final step."

Alkanes have the lowest reactivity because they have only single C-C bonds and are saturated. Alkenes have higher reactivity due to the presence of a C=C double bond, which makes them more reactive than alkanes. Alkynes have the highest reactivity because they contain a C≡C triple bond, which is the most reactive among the three types of hydrocarbons."

The products are formed in this sequential order as more hydrogen atoms are replaced by chlorine.",

For example, arranging them as CCl4, CH3Cl, CHCl3, CH2Cl2 would be wrong because it does not match the step-by-step progression of the chlorination reaction, where each subsequent product has one more chlorine atom substituted for a hydrogen atom."
