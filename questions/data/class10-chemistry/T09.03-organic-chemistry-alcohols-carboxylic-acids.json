    "text": "Alcohols contain the -OH (hydroxyl) functional group. Ethanol (C2H5OH) is prepared by fermentation of sugars or hydration of ethene. Ethanol burns, reacts with sodium to release H2, and can be dehydrated to ethene or oxidized to ethanoic acid. Carboxylic acids contain the -COOH group. Ethanoic acid (CH3COOH) is a weak acid that reacts with bases and carbonates. Esterification: alcohol + carboxylic acid -> ester + water (with conc. H2SO4 catalyst). Esters have fruity smells. Saponification: ester + alkali -> alcohol + salt of acid (soap making).",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order of acid strength is H2CO3, CH3COOH, HCl, HNO3. This is because carbonic acid (H2CO3) is a weaker acid than acetic acid (CH3COOH), which is weaker than hydrochloric acid (HCl), and nitric acid (HNO3) is the strongest.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be HNO3, HCl, H2CO3, CH3COOH. This is incorrect because nitric acid (HNO3) is the strongest acid, followed by hydrochloric acid (HCl), then carbonic acid (H2CO3), and acetic acid (CH3COOH) is the weakest. The correct order is based on the extent of ionization of these acids in water."

This is because the first step of oxidation of ethanol (C2H5OH) is the formation of Ethanal (CH3CHO), followed by the formation of Ethanoic acid (CH3COOH), and finally the complete oxidation to Carbon dioxide (CO2).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Ethanoic acid, Ethanal, and Carbon dioxide. This is incorrect because the first step of oxidation of ethanol is the formation of Ethanal, not Ethanoic acid. Ethanoic acid is formed in the second step of oxidation, after Ethanal."
