    "text": "Alcohols contain the -OH (hydroxyl) functional group. Ethanol (C2H5OH) is prepared by fermentation of sugars or hydration of ethene. Ethanol burns, reacts with sodium to release H2, and can be dehydrated to ethene or oxidized to ethanoic acid. Carboxylic acids contain the -COOH group. Ethanoic acid (CH3COOH) is a weak acid that reacts with bases and carbonates. Esterification: alcohol + carboxylic acid -> ester + water (with conc. H2SO4 catalyst). Esters have fruity smells. Saponification: ester + alkali -> alcohol + salt of acid (soap making).",

      "explanation_correct": "Ethanoic acid is a weak acid that only partially ionises in aqueous solution, unlike HCl which is a strong acid that completely ionises. All other options are true: it turns litmus red (acidic), reacts with carbonates to give CO2, and neutralises NaOH. The misconception that it behaves like strong mineral acids is common.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Ethanoic acid does turn blue litmus red (it is acidic), does react with Na2CO3 (releasing CO2), and does react with NaOH (neutralisation). The exception is complete ionisation — ethanoic acid is a weak acid and only partially dissociates in water, unlike strong acids such as HCl, HNO3, and H2SO4."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "Complete combustion of ethanol (C2H5OH + 3O2 -> 2CO2 + 3H2O) involves the entire molecule being oxidised, not just the -OH group. In contrast, reaction with Na specifically involves the H of the -OH group, esterification involves the -OH group reacting with -COOH, and dehydration involves removal of -OH as water.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Reaction with Na involves the -OH group (H is replaced by Na). Esterification involves the -OH of alcohol combining with -COOH of acid. Dehydration removes the -OH as part of water. Only combustion does not specifically target the -OH group — it burns the entire molecule to CO2 and H2O."

All other statements are true: esters have fruity smells, are formed by esterification, and undergo saponification with alkalis.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Esters do have fruity smells (used in flavourings and perfumes), are formed by alcohol + acid reaction, and do undergo saponification. The misconception is that esters might ionise in water like salts or acids. Being covalent organic compounds, esters do not dissociate into ions."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Ethanoic acid is classified as a weak acid because it only partially dissociates in aqueous solution: CH3COOH ⇌ CH3COO- + H+. Only a small fraction of ethanoic acid molecules ionise at any given time, producing fewer H+ ions compared to strong acids like HCl that fully dissociate. The degree of ionisation, not the number of H atoms or molecular mass, determines acid strength.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The number of hydrogen atoms does not determine acid strength — HCl has one H but is strong. Not all organic compounds are weak acids (some like trichloroacetic acid are quite strong). Molecular mass has no direct relation to acid strength. The key factor is the degree of ionisation in water."

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Esterification is a reversible reaction. Concentrated H2SO4 serves a dual role: it acts as a proton donor (acid catalyst) to speed up the reaction, and more importantly, it acts as a dehydrating agent that absorbs the water produced. By removing water, it shifts the equilibrium towards product (ester) formation according to Le Chatelier's principle.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "While conc. H2SO4 is indeed a stronger proton donor, the key reason is its dehydrating property. Dilute H2SO4 contains water itself, so it cannot act as a dehydrating agent and may even shift equilibrium backward. H2SO4 does not provide heat — it is a catalyst, not a fuel. Dilute H2SO4 does not significantly react with alcohols under these conditions."

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "In ethanol, the polar -OH group dominates over the short ethyl (C2H5-) hydrocarbon chain, enabling extensive hydrogen bonding with water. In butanol, the longer butyl (C4H9-) chain is non-polar and hydrophobic, reducing the influence of the -OH group. As the carbon chain increases, the non-polar character increases, making the alcohol less miscible with water.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Density (lighter/heavier) does not determine miscibility. Both ethanol and butanol are covalent compounds. Butanol has only one -OH group, not more. The key factor is the ratio of the polar -OH group to the non-polar hydrocarbon chain — a shorter chain means the -OH group has more influence on solubility."
