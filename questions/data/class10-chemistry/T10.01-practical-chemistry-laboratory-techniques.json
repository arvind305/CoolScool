Common gases and their tests: H2 burns with pop sound, O2 relights glowing splint, CO2 turns lime water milky, Cl2 bleaches moist litmus, NH3 turns red litmus blue, HCl forms white fumes with NH3. Drying agents: CaO for NH3, conc. H2SO4 for most gases except NH3. Acid-base titrations use indicators: phenolphthalein (colorless to pink) or methyl orange (red to yellow). Salt analysis involves systematic testing of cations with NaOH/NH4OH and anions with specific reagents.",

Safety goggles must always be worn to protect your eyes, even if you are working carefully or at low temperatures. Eyes are very sensitive and can be easily damaged by chemicals or explosions, so goggles are the top priority for lab safety."

It is also not collected by downward displacement of air, as air is heavier than hydrogen and will not allow the hydrogen gas to displace it easily. The correct method is to collect hydrogen by downward displacement of water, as the hydrogen gas will rise up and push the water out of the collection vessel."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The other options are incorrect because CO2 does not turn lime water blue, pink, or red.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be H2, O2, N2, CO2. While hydrogen (H2) is the lightest gas, the order of the others is wrong. Nitrogen (N2) is lighter than oxygen (O2), and carbon dioxide (CO2) is the heaviest gas in the list."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Cl2 (bleach), CO2 (lime water), O2 (glowing splint), H2 (pop). This is wrong because the gases are not arranged in the correct order based on their standard tests. For example, Cl2 should be the last in the order, not the first, since it bleaches moist litmus paper."
