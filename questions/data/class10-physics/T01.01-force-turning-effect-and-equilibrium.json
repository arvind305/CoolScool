    "text": "The moment of a force (torque) about a point is the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from the point to the line of action of the force. Moment = Force x Perpendicular distance, with SI unit Newton-meter (Nm). A couple consists of two equal and opposite parallel forces not acting along the same line, producing pure rotation. The principle of moments states that for a body in rotational equilibrium, the sum of clockwise moments equals the sum of anticlockwise moments. The centre of gravity is the point where the entire weight of a body appears to act. Stability depends on the position of centre of gravity and the base area.",

The moment of a couple is not the product of the forces multiplied together, but rather the product of the force and the perpendicular distance between the forces.

Therefore, both the sum of forces and the sum of moments must be zero for the beam to be in equilibrium.",

This is because the principle of moments states that for a body in rotational equilibrium, the sum of clockwise moments equals the sum of anticlockwise moments. The boy's weight of 400 N acting at a distance of 2 m from the fulcrum creates a clockwise moment of 800 Nm.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 'moment'. For a body to be in complete equilibrium, the resultant force acting on it must be zero, which means all the forces acting on the body are balanced.
