    "text": "Work is done when a force causes displacement in its direction. Work = Force x Displacement x cos(angle). The SI unit is Joule (J). Kinetic energy is energy due to motion (KE = 1/2 mv^2). Potential energy is energy due to position (PE = mgh for gravitational). The work-energy theorem states that work done equals change in kinetic energy. The law of conservation of energy states energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed. Power is the rate of doing work (P = W/t = Fv), measured in Watts. Efficiency is the ratio of useful output to total input.",

For work to be done, the force must cause the object to move in the direction of the force.
