    "text": "Work is done when a force causes displacement in its direction. Work = Force x Displacement x cos(angle). The SI unit is Joule (J). Kinetic energy is energy due to motion (KE = 1/2 mv^2). Potential energy is energy due to position (PE = mgh for gravitational). The work-energy theorem states that work done equals change in kinetic energy. The law of conservation of energy states energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed. Power is the rate of doing work (P = W/t = Fv), measured in Watts. Efficiency is the ratio of useful output to total input.",

For work to be done, the force must cause the object to move in the direction of the force.

This is because the work formula is Work = Force x Displacement x cos(angle), and the angle between the force and displacement is 180 degrees, making cos(180) = -1, resulting in negative work.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 'negative'. The work done is negative when the force and displacement are in opposite directions. This is because the work formula is Work = Force x Displacement x cos(angle), and the angle between the force and displacement is 180 degrees, making cos(180) = -1, resulting in negative work. The work done cannot be positive in this case, as the force and displacement are in opposite directions."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be something other than 1000 watts, such as 100 watts. This is wrong because 1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 watts (W), not 100 watts. The prefix 'kilo' (k) means 1000, so 1 kilowatt is equal to 1000 watts."

This is because an object can have energy due to its motion (kinetic energy) as well as energy due to its position or height (potential energy). The total mechanical energy is the combination of these two forms of energy.",

It also includes the potential energy of the object, which is the energy it possesses due to its position or height. The total mechanical energy is the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy of the object."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 'velocity'. The incorrect answer would be something like 'time' or 'acceleration'. However, power is defined as the rate of doing work, which is the product of force and velocity. Therefore, the correct expression for power is force multiplied by velocity."

This is wrong because 746 watts is smaller than 1 kilowatt (1000 watts), and 100 watts is the smallest value in the list.
