This is because the VR increases as the number of pulley wheels increases, allowing the effort to move a larger distance to lift the load.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: single fixed pulley, block and tackle with 4 pulleys, single movable pulley, and block and tackle with 6 pulleys. This is wrong because the VR increases with the number of pulley wheels, not the type of pulley system. A single movable pulley has a higher VR than a fixed pulley, and a block and tackle with more pulleys has a higher VR than one with fewer pulleys."

This is wrong because the VR of an inclined plane is directly proportional to the length of the inclined plane. The longer the length, the higher the VR.
