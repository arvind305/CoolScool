    "text": "Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another due to change in speed. Snell's law states that sin(i)/sin(r) = n (refractive index). The absolute refractive index is the ratio of speed of light in vacuum to speed in the medium. When light travels from denser to rarer medium and angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle, total internal reflection occurs. Critical angle is the angle of incidence for which angle of refraction is 90 degrees. A prism causes deviation and dispersion of light, splitting white light into the spectrum VIBGYOR.",

Refraction occurs due to the change in the speed of light as it travels from one medium to another with a different refractive index.

When light enters the diamond from air, it undergoes total internal reflection at the inner surface of the diamond, causing the light to reflect back into the diamond and create the brilliant sparkle.",

Total internal reflection occurs when light travels from a denser medium (diamond) to a rarer medium (air), and the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle.

Both slabs have the same refractive index and angle of incidence, so the only differing factor is thickness.",

      "explanation_correct": "A glass slab with parallel faces does not produce any net angular deviation or noticeable dispersion. The emergent ray is parallel to the incident ray, though shifted sideways (lateral displacement). Unlike a prism, which has non-parallel faces and produces both deviation and dispersion, the parallel faces of a glass slab ensure the refraction at the exit surface exactly undoes the angular change at the entry surface.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "A glass slab does not separate colours noticeably because any slight splitting at the entry face is recombined at the exit face due to the parallel surfaces. It is not a deviating device because the emergent ray is parallel to the incident ray. It only produces lateral displacement without angular deviation or permanent colour separation."

This refraction causes the image of objects above water to appear shifted upward, making the lamp post look taller than it actually is. This is the same principle as apparent depth, applied in reverse.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Total internal reflection does not apply here because light is entering the denser medium (water), not leaving it.
