    "text": "Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one medium to another due to change in speed. Snell's law states that sin(i)/sin(r) = n (refractive index). The absolute refractive index is the ratio of speed of light in vacuum to speed in the medium. When light travels from denser to rarer medium and angle of incidence exceeds the critical angle, total internal reflection occurs. Critical angle is the angle of incidence for which angle of refraction is 90 degrees. A prism causes deviation and dispersion of light, splitting white light into the spectrum VIBGYOR.",

Refraction occurs due to the change in the speed of light as it travels from one medium to another with a different refractive index.

      "explanation_correct": "The spectrum of visible light is arranged in the order of increasing wavelength, from violet (shortest) to red (longest). This is because as light passes through a prism, the different colors of the spectrum get bent by different amounts, with the shorter wavelengths (violet) bending more than the longer wavelengths (red).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct order of the colors in the visible spectrum from shortest to longest wavelength is: violet, blue, green, yellow, orange, red. The given order of violet, green, yellow, red is incorrect because green has a longer wavelength than yellow, and yellow has a longer wavelength than red."

      "explanation_correct": "The speed of light in a medium is inversely proportional to the refractive index of the medium. Since the refractive index of glass is highest for red light and lowest for violet light, the speed of light in glass follows the order: violet > blue > green > red.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be red, green, blue, violet. This is because the common misconception is that the colors with longer wavelengths (red) have higher speeds in the medium. However, the refractive index is actually higher for the shorter wavelengths (violet), so the speed of light in glass is lowest for red and highest for violet."

      "explanation_incorrect": "When light travels from a denser medium (glass) to a rarer medium (air), it first bends away from the normal due to refraction. As the angle of incidence increases, the angle of refraction also increases until it reaches 90 degrees, which is the critical angle. At angles of incidence greater than the critical angle, total internal reflection occurs."
