    "text": "Lenses are transparent optical devices that refract light. Convex (converging) lenses are thicker at the center and converge parallel rays to a focus. Concave (diverging) lenses are thinner at the center and diverge parallel rays. The lens formula is 1/f = 1/v - 1/u, where f is focal length, v is image distance, and u is object distance. Magnification m = v/u = h'/h. Power of lens P = 1/f (in meters), measured in Dioptres (D). Convex lenses have positive power; concave lenses have negative power.",

The positive v confirms a real image on the opposite side. Magnification m = v/u = 60/(-12) = -5, confirming a magnified, inverted, real image.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The image distance must be positive for a real image formed by a convex lens when the object is between F and 2F. Using the lens formula correctly gives v = +60 cm.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The tree being far away is not the specific reason — even close objects appear smaller through a concave lens. Concave lenses do not magnify; they diminish. A lens with zero power is a plane glass that does not change image size. The property of always forming diminished images is unique to concave lenses."
