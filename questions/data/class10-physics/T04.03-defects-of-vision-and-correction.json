    "text": "The human eye acts as a natural optical system with a convex lens that focuses images on the retina. The near point (25 cm) is the closest distance for clear vision, and far point (infinity) is the farthest. Myopia (short-sightedness) occurs when the eyeball is elongated or lens too curved, causing distant objects to focus in front of the retina; corrected by concave lens. Hypermetropia (long-sightedness) occurs when eyeball is shortened or lens too flat, causing near objects to focus behind retina; corrected by convex lens. Presbyopia is age-related loss of accommodation, corrected by bifocal lenses.",

      "correct_answer": "bifocal",
      "explanation_correct": "Presbyopia is corrected using bifocal lenses because as we age, the lens in our eye becomes less flexible, making it harder to focus on nearby objects. Bifocal lenses have two different focal lengths - one for distance vision and one for near vision, which helps to correct this age-related loss of accommodation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'bifocal' lenses. Presbyopia is not corrected using single-vision lenses, as they only have one focal length. Bifocal lenses have two different focal lengths - one for distance vision and one for near vision, which helps to correct the age-related loss of accommodation in the eye's lens that causes presbyopia."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Lens, Cornea, Pupil, Retina. This is wrong because light does not enter the eye through the lens first. The correct order is Cornea, Pupil, Lens, Retina as light passes through these parts of the eye in that sequence."
