    "text": "Sound is a longitudinal mechanical wave that requires a medium for propagation. It travels through compression and rarefaction of particles. Key wave parameters include frequency (f) in Hertz, wavelength (lambda), amplitude, and velocity (v = f x lambda). Speed of sound is highest in solids, then liquids, then gases. Loudness depends on amplitude and is measured in decibels (dB). Pitch depends on frequency. Quality (timbre) distinguishes sounds from different sources. Echo is the reflection of sound requiring minimum 17.2 m distance for distinct hearing. Ultrasound (>20 kHz) has applications in SONAR, medical imaging, and cleaning.",

Sound also does not travel as an electromagnetic wave like light, and it is not a matter wave like electron waves. Sound requires a medium to travel, so it is a longitudinal mechanical wave."

Option C is incorrect because Riya is outdoors with a single reflecting surface, so the reflected sound returns as a distinct echo, not reverberation (which requires multiple reflections in an enclosed space).

This is a common misconception area — students often think frequency changes when the medium changes, but it does not.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Frequency (option A) does not change when sound enters a different medium — it is fixed by the vibrating source.
