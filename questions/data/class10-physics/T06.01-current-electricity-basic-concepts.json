      "correct_answer": "conductivity",
      "explanation_correct": "The reciprocal of resistivity, which is a material property, is called conductivity. Conductivity is a measure of how easily electric charge can flow through a material. The higher the conductivity, the better the material conducts electricity.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 'conductivity'. Resistivity is a measure of how much a material resists the flow of electric current. The reciprocal of resistivity is the conductivity, which represents how easily the current can flow through the material. So the correct answer is 'conductivity', not the reciprocal of resistivity."

      "correct_answer": "area",
      "explanation_correct": "The resistance of a wire is inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area because a larger area allows more charge carriers (electrons) to flow through the wire, resulting in lower resistance.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'area'. The resistance of a wire is inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area, meaning that as the area increases, the resistance decreases. This is because a larger cross-sectional area allows more charge carriers to flow through the wire, reducing the overall resistance."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Nichrome, Copper, Iron. Nichrome actually has the highest resistivity among these three materials, followed by iron, and then copper has the lowest resistivity. The resistivity of a material depends on the inherent properties of the material, with materials like nichrome having higher resistivity compared to metals like copper and iron."

      "explanation_correct": "The resistance of a wire is inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area (R = ρL/A). Since all the wires are made of the same material and have the same length, the wire with the smaller diameter (1 mm) will have the highest resistance, followed by the wire with 2 mm diameter, and the wire with the largest diameter of 4 mm will have the lowest resistance.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect explanation would be that the resistance is directly proportional to the diameter of the wire. This is not correct because the resistance of a wire depends on its cross-sectional area, not just its diameter. The wire with the larger diameter will have a larger cross-sectional area, which means it will have a lower resistance compared to the wire with a smaller diameter."

This shows that the current is directly proportional to the voltage, as stated by Ohm's law.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to first plot the V-I graph, then connect the ammeter and voltmeter, and finally vary the voltage and observe the current. This is wrong because you need to first set up the circuit correctly with the ammeter and voltmeter in the right positions before you can start varying the voltage and current to plot the graph. The correct order ensures that the measurements are taken properly to demonstrate the linear relationship between voltage and current as per Ohm's law."
