By convention, current direction was established as the direction positive charges would move (positive to negative), before the discovery that electrons are the actual charge carriers in metallic conductors.

      "explanation_incorrect": "Metals and semiconductors respond to temperature changes in opposite ways. Metals have abundant free electrons already, so higher temperature mainly increases lattice vibrations that obstruct electron flow, raising resistance.

This is because part of the energy supplied per unit charge (EMF) is used to overcome the internal resistance of the cell. The relationship is: Terminal voltage = EMF - Ir, where I is the current and r is the internal resistance. Since Ir is always positive when current flows, the terminal voltage is always less than the EMF.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "EMF and terminal voltage are equal only in an open circuit (when no current flows). As soon as the cell supplies current, there is a voltage drop (Ir) across the internal resistance, making the terminal voltage less than the EMF.
