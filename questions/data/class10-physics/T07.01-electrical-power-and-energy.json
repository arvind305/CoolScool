    "text": "Electrical energy is the work done by electric current. E = VIt = I^2Rt = V^2t/R, measured in Joules. Electrical power is the rate of energy transfer: P = VI = I^2R = V^2/R, measured in Watts. The commercial unit of energy is kilowatt-hour (kWh), where 1 kWh = 3.6 x 10^6 J. The heating effect of current (Joule's law) states H = I^2Rt. Household circuits use parallel connections with live, neutral, and earth wires. Fuses and MCBs protect circuits from overloading.",

      "correct_answer": "nichrome",
      "explanation_correct": "Heating elements are made of nichrome because it has a high electrical resistivity, which means it can resist the flow of electric current. This high resistance causes the heating element to get hot when electric current passes through it, producing the desired heating effect.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is nichrome. Nichrome is an alloy of nickel and chromium that is commonly used in heating elements because it has a high electrical resistivity. Other materials like copper or aluminum would not be suitable, as they have a low resistivity and would not generate enough heat when an electric current passes through them."

      "correct_answer": "live",
      "explanation_correct": "The switch is always connected in the live wire because the live wire carries the current that powers the electrical circuit. When the switch is on, it completes the circuit and allows current to flow through the live wire to the appliance.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The switch is not connected in the neutral or earth wire. The neutral wire carries the return current back to the power source, while the earth wire provides a safe path for any leakage current. The switch must be connected in the live wire to control the flow of current in the circuit."

      "correct_answer": "10",
      "explanation_correct": "The power of the heater is 2 kW, and it was used for 5 hours. To find the total energy consumed, we use the formula: Energy = Power × Time. So, Energy = 2 kW × 5 hours = 10 kWh, which is 10 units of electricity.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 10 units of electricity. This is because the power of the heater is 2 kW, and it was used for 5 hours. To find the total energy consumed, we multiply the power by the time, which gives us 10 kWh, or 10 units of electricity. The units of electricity are measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh), not just kW or hours."

This is because the LED bulb has the lowest power consumption, followed by the ceiling fan, electric iron, and electric heater, which have successively higher power requirements.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Ceiling fan (50-75 W), LED bulb (5-15 W), Electric iron (750-1000 W), and Electric heater (1000-2000 W). This is not correct because the power rating increases from the LED bulb to the ceiling fan, electric iron, and finally the electric heater, which has the highest power consumption among the given appliances."

      "explanation_correct": "The order of increasing energy consumption is 60 W fan, 100 W bulb, 500 W iron, and 2000 W heater. This is because the energy consumed is proportional to the power rating of the device, and the devices are arranged in order of increasing power rating.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be 100 W bulb, 60 W fan, 500 W iron, and 2000 W heater. This is because the energy consumed is not just dependent on the power rating, but also on the duration of usage. The 100 W bulb would consume more energy than the 60 W fan if they were used for the same duration, even though the power rating of the bulb is higher."

However, the correct order is based on the materials' resistivity values, with copper having the lowest resistivity and nichrome having the highest. The resistivity of a material determines how much it opposes the flow of electric current through it."
