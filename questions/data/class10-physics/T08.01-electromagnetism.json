      "correct_answer": "laminated",
      "explanation_correct": "The transformer core is made of thin, stacked metal sheets or laminations to reduce eddy current losses. Eddy currents are unwanted electric currents that flow through the core material when it is exposed to a changing magnetic field, causing energy losses. Laminating the core breaks up the flow of eddy currents, making the transformer more efficient.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The transformer core is not solid metal, but rather laminated or made of thin metal sheets. This laminated structure is important to reduce eddy current losses. Eddy currents are electric currents that flow through the core material when it is exposed to a changing magnetic field, and these currents can cause energy losses. By laminating the core, the flow of eddy currents is broken up, making the transformer more efficient."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is Electrical energy input -> Force on conductor -> Rotating armature -> Mechanical output because the electrical energy input powers the current in the conductor, which then experiences a force due to the magnetic field, causing the armature to rotate and produce mechanical output.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Force on conductor -> Electrical energy input -> Rotating armature -> Mechanical output. This is wrong because the force on the conductor is produced by the current, which requires electrical energy input. The rotating armature is then driven by this force, leading to the final mechanical output."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is: Coil rotates in magnetic field, Magnetic flux changes, EMF is induced, Current flows in external circuit. This is because when the coil rotates in the magnetic field, the magnetic flux linked with the coil changes, which according to Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, induces an EMF in the coil. This induced EMF then drives current in the external circuit.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order is: Current flows in external circuit, Coil rotates in magnetic field, EMF is induced, Magnetic flux changes. This is wrong because the current flowing in the external circuit is a result of the induced EMF, which is caused by the change in magnetic flux as the coil rotates in the magnetic field. The change in magnetic flux must occur first before the EMF is induced, which then drives the current in the external circuit."

The step-up transformer at the power station increases the voltage to high levels, which reduces energy loss in the transmission lines. Then, the step-down transformer at the substation reduces the voltage back to a safe level for home usage.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The power is not transmitted directly from the power station to the home. Instead, the voltage is first increased using a step-up transformer at the power station, then transmitted through high-voltage lines. At the substation, the voltage is stepped down using another transformer before reaching the homes at 220 V. This arrangement allows for efficient and safe power transmission over long distances."

      "explanation_correct": "The strength of an electromagnet increases when you increase the current flowing through the coil, increase the number of turns in the coil, and use a soft iron core. The soft iron core helps concentrate the magnetic field, while more current and turns produce a stronger magnetic field around the coil.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Increasing the current and number of turns in the coil will increase the strength of the electromagnet, but using a soft iron core is the most important factor. The soft iron core acts as a path for the magnetic field, allowing the field to be much stronger compared to just having a coil with current flowing through it. So the correct order is: use soft iron core, increase number of turns, increase current."
