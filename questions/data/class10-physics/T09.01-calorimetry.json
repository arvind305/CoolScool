    "text": "Calorimetry is the measurement of heat. Heat capacity (C) is the heat required to raise temperature by 1 degree. Specific heat capacity (c) is the heat required to raise 1 kg by 1 degree (Q = mc delta_T). Water has high specific heat (4200 J/kg K). The principle of calorimetry states that heat lost = heat gained in an isolated system. Latent heat is the heat absorbed/released during change of state without temperature change. Latent heat of fusion of ice is 336 kJ/kg, latent heat of vaporization of water is 2260 kJ/kg (Q = mL).",

Specific heat capacity does not refer to the heat required to melt a solid (option B) or boil a liquid (option C), as these are related to latent heat rather than specific heat.

      "correct_answer": "4.186",
      "explanation_correct": "The answer is correct because 1 calorie is equal to 4.186 joules. This is the conversion factor between the two units of energy, which are commonly used in physics and chemistry.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 4.186. However, the incorrect answer may have arisen due to a misunderstanding of the conversion factor between calories and joules. 1 calorie is not equal to 1 joule, but rather 1 calorie is equivalent to 4.186 joules. This is because the calorie is a unit of energy that is specific to the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius, while the joule is the standard unit of energy in the International System of Units (SI)."

      "explanation_correct": "The latent heat of fusion of ice is 80 cal/g because it is the amount of heat required to melt 1 gram of ice at 0°C without changing the temperature. This value is specific to the change of state from solid (ice) to liquid (water).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The latent heat of fusion of ice is not 336 kJ/kg, which is the value in SI units. To convert this to the requested units of cal/g, we need to divide 336 kJ/kg by 4.184 (the conversion factor between kJ and cal), which gives us 80 cal/g. This is the correct value for the latent heat of fusion of ice."

      "explanation_correct": "The latent heat of vaporization of water is 2260 kJ/kg, which is equivalent to 540 cal/g. This is because 1 kJ = 1000 J, and 1 cal = 4.184 J, so 2260 kJ/kg = 2260 * 1000 / 4.184 = 540,000 cal/kg = 540 cal/g.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The given accepted answer format is 540 cal/g, which is the correct value for the latent heat of vaporization of water. The latent heat of vaporization is the amount of energy required to change a liquid (water) into a gas (water vapor) without changing the temperature. This value is an important property of water and is frequently used in calculations involving phase changes."

Calorimetry is the general study of heat measurements, but the specific method used to find the specific heat capacity of a substance is the method of mixtures, not calorimetry. In the method of mixtures, the substance is mixed with a liquid of known specific heat, and the temperature change is used to calculate the specific heat of the substance."

This is the correct sequence of phase changes and temperature changes when heating ice to steam.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to skip the melting of ice at 0°C. In that case, the ice would go straight from being heated from -20°C to 0°C, to being heated as liquid water from 0°C to 100°C. This is incorrect because ice needs to melt at 0°C before it can be heated as liquid water. The full correct order is: heating ice (-20°C to 0°C), melting ice (0°C), heating water (0°C to 100°C), boiling water (100°C), and heating steam (100°C to 120°C)."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The order from lowest to highest specific heat capacity is not Water, Copper, Iron, Aluminium.
