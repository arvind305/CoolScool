    "text": "Calorimetry is the measurement of heat. Heat capacity (C) is the heat required to raise temperature by 1 degree. Specific heat capacity (c) is the heat required to raise 1 kg by 1 degree (Q = mc delta_T). Water has high specific heat (4200 J/kg K). The principle of calorimetry states that heat lost = heat gained in an isolated system. Latent heat is the heat absorbed/released during change of state without temperature change. Latent heat of fusion of ice is 336 kJ/kg, latent heat of vaporization of water is 2260 kJ/kg (Q = mL).",

Specific heat capacity does not refer to the heat required to melt a solid (option B) or boil a liquid (option C), as these are related to latent heat rather than specific heat.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 4.186. However, the incorrect answer may have arisen due to a misunderstanding of the conversion factor between calories and joules. 1 calorie is not equal to 1 joule, but rather 1 calorie is equivalent to 4.186 joules. This is because the calorie is a unit of energy that is specific to the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius, while the joule is the standard unit of energy in the International System of Units (SI)."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is a practical consideration but not the scientific reason for choosing water. Option C is wrong because water's boiling point (100 degrees C) is not particularly low, and boiling point is not relevant to its use as a coolant. Option D is wrong because water's density is not especially low compared to other liquids, and density is not the primary reason for its use in these applications."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Copper is chosen for calorimeters for two scientific reasons. First, its low specific heat capacity (380 J/(kg.K)) means the calorimeter itself absorbs very little heat from the experiment, minimising errors. Second, its high thermal conductivity ensures that the calorimeter quickly reaches the same temperature as its contents, allowing accurate temperature readings. Together, these properties make copper ideal for precise heat measurements.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is irrelevant to scientific accuracy. Option C is wrong because copper is actually more expensive than steel; cost is not the reason for its selection. Option D is wrong because glass is chemically inert and does not react with water, yet glass is not preferred for calorimeters due to its low thermal conductivity and the difficulty of machining it into the right shape."
