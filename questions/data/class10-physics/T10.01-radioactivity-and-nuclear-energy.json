    "text": "Radioactivity is the spontaneous emission of radiation from unstable nuclei, discovered by Becquerel. Three types of emissions exist: alpha particles (helium nuclei, +2 charge, least penetrating), beta particles (electrons, -1 charge, moderate penetration), and gamma rays (electromagnetic radiation, no charge, most penetrating). Half-life is the time for half the nuclei to decay. Nuclear fission is splitting of heavy nuclei (e.g., U-235) releasing energy and neutrons, used in nuclear reactors. Nuclear fusion is combining light nuclei (e.g., hydrogen to helium), the source of solar energy. Nuclear energy has applications in power generation and medicine, but poses hazards including radiation effects and waste disposal challenges.",

      "explanation_correct": "Alpha particles have the least penetrating power, followed by beta particles, and gamma rays have the highest penetrating power. This is because alpha particles are the heaviest and have the most charge, beta particles are lighter and have less charge, while gamma rays are electromagnetic radiation with no charge and can easily pass through matter.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The order of increasing penetrating power is not alpha, beta, gamma. Alpha particles are actually the least penetrating, followed by beta particles, and gamma rays are the most penetrating. This is because alpha particles are large and have a lot of charge, so they interact strongly with matter and get absorbed quickly. Beta particles are smaller and have less charge, so they can penetrate further. Gamma rays have no charge and are just high-energy electromagnetic radiation, so they can travel the farthest through materials."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The order of increasing ionizing power is actually gamma rays, beta particles, and then alpha particles. Gamma rays have the highest ionizing power because they are high-energy electromagnetic radiation that can easily penetrate and ionize atoms. Beta particles, being fast-moving electrons, have a moderate ionizing power. Alpha particles have the largest mass and charge, making them the least penetrating and therefore the lowest in ionizing power."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Neutrons hit other nuclei, Neutron hits U-235 nucleus, Nucleus splits releasing energy and neutrons, More fissions occur. This is incorrect because the chain reaction starts with a neutron hitting a U-235 nucleus, causing it to split and release more neutrons, which then go on to hit other U-235 nuclei, leading to more fissions and a self-sustaining chain reaction."

After 3 half-lives, 1/8 remains. After 4 half-lives, 1/16 remains.
