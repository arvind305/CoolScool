    "text": "Radioactivity is the spontaneous emission of radiation from unstable nuclei, discovered by Becquerel. Three types of emissions exist: alpha particles (helium nuclei, +2 charge, least penetrating), beta particles (electrons, -1 charge, moderate penetration), and gamma rays (electromagnetic radiation, no charge, most penetrating). Half-life is the time for half the nuclei to decay. Nuclear fission is splitting of heavy nuclei (e.g., U-235) releasing energy and neutrons, used in nuclear reactors. Nuclear fusion is combining light nuclei (e.g., hydrogen to helium), the source of solar energy. Nuclear energy has applications in power generation and medicine, but poses hazards including radiation effects and waste disposal challenges.",

Alpha particles are actually the least penetrating, followed by beta particles, and gamma rays are the most penetrating. This is because alpha particles are large and have a lot of charge, so they interact strongly with matter and get absorbed quickly. Beta particles are smaller and have less charge, so they can penetrate further. Gamma rays have no charge and are just high-energy electromagnetic radiation, so they can travel the farthest through materials."

Since each half-life is 5730 years, the age is 3 × 5730 = 17190 years. After the first half-life (5730 years), 1/2 remains; after the second (11460 years), 1/4 remains; after the third (17190 years), 1/8 remains.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "5730 years would leave 1/2 remaining, not 1/8. 11460 years (2 half-lives) would leave 1/4 remaining. 22920 years (4 half-lives) would leave 1/16 remaining. The correct calculation requires identifying that 1/8 = (1/2)^3, meaning 3 half-lives have passed, giving 3 × 5730 = 17190 years."
