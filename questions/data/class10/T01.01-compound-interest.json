    "text": "Compound Interest is the interest calculated on the principal amount plus the accumulated interest from previous periods. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/100)^n, where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the rate of interest per period, and n is the number of periods. When compounding occurs more frequently than annually (half-yearly or quarterly), the rate and time are adjusted accordingly. For half-yearly compounding, r is divided by 2 and n is multiplied by 2. For quarterly compounding, r is divided by 4 and n is multiplied by 4. This formula is also used to solve growth and depreciation problems in real-world contexts.",
