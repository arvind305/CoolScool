    "text": "Compound Interest is the interest calculated on the principal amount plus the accumulated interest from previous periods. The formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/100)^n, where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the rate of interest per period, and n is the number of periods. When compounding occurs more frequently than annually (half-yearly or quarterly), the rate and time are adjusted accordingly. For half-yearly compounding, r is divided by 2 and n is multiplied by 2. For quarterly compounding, r is divided by 4 and n is multiplied by 4. This formula is also used to solve growth and depreciation problems in real-world contexts.",

Option C, A = P(1 - r/100)^n, is the formula for depreciation, which is the opposite of compound interest. Option D, A = P(1 + r/200)^n, is incorrect because the rate of interest per period should be divided by 100, not 200, for annual compounding."

      "correct_answer": "6",
      "explanation_correct": "The correct answer is 6% per annum. This can be calculated using the compound interest formula: A = P(1 + r/100)^n, where A is the final amount (Rs 11,236), P is the principal amount (Rs 10,000), n is the number of years (2), and r is the rate of interest per annum. Solving for r, we get r = 6%.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to assume that the interest is simple interest rather than compound interest. In that case, the formula would be A = P + Prt, where A is the final amount, P is the principal, r is the rate of interest per annum, and t is the time in years. Plugging in the values, we would get r = 6.18%, which is not the correct answer. The correct answer is 6% per annum, as calculated using the compound interest formula."

The depreciation formula accounts for the decrease in value by using the term (1 - r/100).",

The growth formula is used to calculate the increase in value over time, such as in investments or population growth. Depreciation, on the other hand, represents the decrease in value of a machine or asset due to use and age, which is better represented by the formula A = P(1 - r/100)^n."
