    "text": "Goods and Services Tax (GST) is an indirect tax levied on the supply of goods and services. It is a comprehensive, multi-stage, destination-based tax that replaced multiple cascading taxes. GST can be categorized as: (1) CGST (Central GST) and SGST (State GST) for intra-state transactions, where both central and state governments levy tax; (2) IGST (Integrated GST) for inter-state transactions. Input Tax Credit (ITC) allows businesses to claim credit for GST paid on purchases against GST collected on sales, ensuring tax is only paid on value addition. Net GST payable = Output GST - Input Tax Credit (if positive); Net GST receivable = Input Tax Credit - Output GST (if credit exceeds output tax). In multi-stage supply chains, GST is applied at each stage of production and distribution, but the tax burden only falls on the final consumer due to the ITC mechanism.",
    "rules": [
      "For intra-state transactions: CGST + SGST = Total GST (each is half of the total GST rate)",
      "For inter-state transactions: IGST = Total GST rate",
      "GST Amount = (GST Rate / 100) × Taxable Value",
      "Total Price = Taxable Value + GST Amount",
      "Input Tax Credit (ITC) = GST paid on purchases",
      "Output Tax = GST collected on sales",
      "Net GST Payable = Output Tax - Input Tax Credit (when positive)",
      "Net GST Receivable = Input Tax Credit - Output Tax (when credit exceeds)",
      "In supply chain: Each entity pays GST on purchases (input tax) and collects on sales (output tax), remitting only the difference"
