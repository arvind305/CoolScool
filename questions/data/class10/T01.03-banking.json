    "text": "Recurring Deposit (RD) accounts allow customers to deposit a fixed amount regularly (usually monthly) for a predetermined period. The bank pays interest on these deposits. The maturity value is the total amount received at the end of the term, which equals the sum of all deposits plus the interest earned. The interest on RD accounts is calculated using the formula: I = P × n(n+1)/(2×12) × r/100, where P is the monthly installment, n is the number of months, r is the annual rate of interest, and I is the interest earned. The maturity value (MV) = Total deposits + Interest = (P × n) + I.",

Option B (× r/100) is incorrect because it is missing the other variables needed to calculate the interest. Option C (P × n(n+1)/(24)) is incorrect because it uses a different formula to calculate the interest, which is not the one given in the question context."
