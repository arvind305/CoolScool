    "text": "Recurring Deposit (RD) accounts allow customers to deposit a fixed amount regularly (usually monthly) for a predetermined period. The bank pays interest on these deposits. The maturity value is the total amount received at the end of the term, which equals the sum of all deposits plus the interest earned. The interest on RD accounts is calculated using the formula: I = P × n(n+1)/(2×12) × r/100, where P is the monthly installment, n is the number of months, r is the annual rate of interest, and I is the interest earned. The maturity value (MV) = Total deposits + Interest = (P × n) + I.",
    "rules": [
      "RD accounts require fixed monthly deposits for a specified period",
      "Interest is calculated using the formula: I = P × n(n+1)/(2×12) × r/100",
      "P = monthly installment amount, n = number of months, r = annual interest rate (%)",
      "Total deposits = P × n",
      "Maturity Value (MV) = Total deposits + Interest = (P × n) + I",
      "The formula can be rearranged to find P, n, or r when other values are given",
      "Interest is compounded quarterly but calculated using the simplified formula",
      "All monetary values should be in the same currency unit"
