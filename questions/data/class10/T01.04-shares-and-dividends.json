    "text": "Shares and dividends involve understanding the relationship between nominal (face) value and market value of shares, calculating dividends based on face value and dividend rates, determining rate of return (yield) on investments, accounting for brokerage costs, and comparing different investment options. The face value is the original value printed on the share certificate, while market value is the actual price at which shares are bought or sold (at premium when above face value, at par when equal, or at discount when below). Dividend is calculated on face value, while rate of return considers the actual investment including market value and brokerage. Brokerage is a commission paid to the broker for facilitating the transaction.",
    "rules": [
      "Face value (Nominal value) is the original value of a share printed on the certificate",
      "Market value is the price at which a share is actually bought or sold in the market",
      "Premium: Market value > Face value (e.g., Rs 100 share at Rs 120 is at 20% premium or Rs 20 premium)",
      "At par: Market value = Face value",
      "Discount: Market value < Face value (e.g., Rs 100 share at Rs 80 is at 20% discount or Rs 20 discount)",
      "Dividend is always calculated on face value, not market value",
      "Dividend amount = (Face value × Number of shares × Rate of dividend) / 100",
      "Investment = (Market value × Number of shares) + Brokerage",
      "Brokerage is calculated on market value",
      "Rate of return (Yield) = (Annual dividend / Total investment) × 100",
      "When comparing investments, higher rate of return indicates a better investment",
      "Number of shares = Investment (after brokerage) / Market value per share"
