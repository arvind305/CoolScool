This is because the Remainder Theorem states that the remainder when a polynomial is divided by (x - a) is equal to the value of the polynomial when x is replaced by a, which in this case is -3.",

Option A has the wrong quotient and remainder, while options B and D have the correct quotient but the wrong remainder. The key is to recognize that when dividing by (x + 3), we are effectively evaluating the polynomial at x = -3, and the remainder is the value of the polynomial at that point."
