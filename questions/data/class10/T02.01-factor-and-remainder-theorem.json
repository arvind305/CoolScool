    "text": "The Remainder Theorem states that when a polynomial f(x) is divided by (x-a), the remainder is f(a). The Factor Theorem is a special case: (x-a) is a factor of f(x) if and only if f(a) = 0. These theorems are fundamental for factorising polynomials, particularly cubics. Synthetic division provides an efficient method for polynomial division and factorisation.",
