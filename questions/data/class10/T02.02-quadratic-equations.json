    "text": "A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of degree 2, written in standard form as ax² + bx + c = 0, where a ≠ 0. There are three main methods to solve quadratic equations: (1) Factorisation - expressing the equation as a product of two linear factors and setting each equal to zero; (2) Completing the square - converting the equation into perfect square form (x + p)² = q; (3) Quadratic formula - using x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac))/(2a). The discriminant (D = b² - 4ac) determines the nature of roots: D > 0 gives two distinct real roots, D = 0 gives two equal real roots, and D < 0 gives no real roots (complex roots). Quadratic equations appear in many real-world problems involving areas, ages, numbers, projectile motion, and optimization.",
