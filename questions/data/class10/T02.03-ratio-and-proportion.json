    "text": "Ratio and Proportion is a fundamental concept in mathematics that deals with the relationship between quantities. A ratio compares two quantities of the same kind, while proportion states that two ratios are equal. Key properties include: (1) Componendo and Dividendo: If a/b = c/d, then (a+b)/(a-b) = (c+d)/(c-d); (2) Alternendo: If a/b = c/d, then a/c = b/d; (3) Invertendo: If a/b = c/d, then b/a = d/c; (4) Cross Multiplication: If a/b = c/d, then ad = bc; (5) Mean Proportional: If a, b, c are in continued proportion, then b² = ac; (6) Continued Proportion: Three quantities a, b, c are in continued proportion if a/b = b/c.",
