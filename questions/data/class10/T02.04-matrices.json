    "text": "A matrix is a rectangular arrangement of numbers in rows and columns, enclosed in square brackets. Matrices are classified by their order (m × n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns. Key types include: Row matrix (1 × n), Column matrix (m × 1), Square matrix (m = n), Null/Zero matrix (all elements are 0), and Identity matrix (square matrix with 1s on main diagonal and 0s elsewhere). Two matrices are equal if they have the same order and corresponding elements are equal. Matrix operations include addition/subtraction (only for matrices of same order), scalar multiplication (multiplying each element by a scalar), and matrix multiplication (for compatible matrices where number of columns in first equals number of rows in second). For 2×2 matrices A and B, if A = [[a,b],[c,d]] and B = [[e,f],[g,h]], then AB = [[ae+bg, af+bh],[ce+dg, cf+dh]].",

      "Matrix order is written as rows × columns (m × n)",

      "For matrix multiplication AB to exist, number of columns in A must equal number of rows in B",
      "Matrix multiplication is not commutative: AB ≠ BA in general",
      "The identity matrix I has the property AI = IA = A",
      "A null matrix has all elements equal to zero",
