    "text": "An Arithmetic Progression (AP) is a sequence of numbers in which the difference between any two consecutive terms is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference (d). If 'a' is the first term, the general term (nth term) is given by a_n = a + (n-1)d. The sum of first n terms is S_n = n/2[2a + (n-1)d] or S_n = n/2[a + l], where l is the last term. These formulas are fundamental for solving problems involving AP, including finding unknown terms, common difference, number of terms, or sum when other parameters are given.",
    "rules": [
      "In an AP, the difference between consecutive terms (common difference d) remains constant: d = a_n - a_(n-1)",
      "The general term (nth term) formula is a_n = a + (n-1)d, where a is the first term",
      "The sum of first n terms is S_n = n/2[2a + (n-1)d]",
      "Alternative sum formula: S_n = n/2[a + l], where l is the last term",
      "If a, b, c are in AP, then b - a = c - b, or 2b = a + c (b is the arithmetic mean)",
      "Given any three of {a, d, n, a_n, S_n}, the other two can be determined"
