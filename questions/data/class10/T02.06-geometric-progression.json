    "text": "A Geometric Progression (GP) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio (r). The general term of a GP is given by a_n = a*r^(n-1), where 'a' is the first term, 'r' is the common ratio, and 'n' is the term number. The sum of the first n terms of a GP is S_n = a(r^n - 1)/(r-1) when r ≠ 1, and S_n = na when r = 1. These formulas are fundamental for solving problems involving geometric sequences, including finding specific terms, determining the common ratio, calculating sums, and solving real-world application problems involving exponential growth or decay.",

This is because when the common ratio (r) is 1, the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a GP simplifies to S_n = na, where 'a' is the first term. Plugging in the given values of a = 5 and S_n = 30, we can solve for n, which gives us 6 terms.",
