    "text": "A Geometric Progression (GP) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio (r). The general term of a GP is given by a_n = a*r^(n-1), where 'a' is the first term, 'r' is the common ratio, and 'n' is the term number. The sum of the first n terms of a GP is S_n = a(r^n - 1)/(r-1) when r ≠ 1, and S_n = na when r = 1. These formulas are fundamental for solving problems involving geometric sequences, including finding specific terms, determining the common ratio, calculating sums, and solving real-world application problems involving exponential growth or decay.",
    "rules": [
      "In a GP, the ratio of any term to its preceding term is constant (common ratio r)",
      "General term: a_n = a*r^(n-1) where a is the first term",
      "Sum of n terms: S_n = a(r^n - 1)/(r-1) when r > 1",
      "Sum of n terms: S_n = a(1 - r^n)/(1-r) when r < 1",
      "When r = 1, the GP becomes a constant sequence and S_n = na",
      "Three consecutive terms in GP satisfy: b^2 = ac (geometric mean property)",
      "If each term of a GP is multiplied or divided by a non-zero constant, the resulting sequence is also a GP",
      "Common ratio r = a_n/a_(n-1) for any consecutive terms"
