    "text": "A surd is an irrational number that cannot be expressed as a rational number. Surds involve roots (square roots, cube roots, etc.) that cannot be simplified to give a rational number. Like surds have the same irrational factor and can be added or subtracted. Operations on surds include addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Rationalisation is the process of eliminating surds from the denominator of a fraction. For binomial surd denominators of the form (a + √b), we multiply by the conjugate (a - √b) using the identity (a+b)(a-b) = a² - b². This process simplifies expressions and makes calculations easier.",
