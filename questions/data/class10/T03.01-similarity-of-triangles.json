    "text": "Two triangles are similar if their corresponding angles are equal and their corresponding sides are in proportion. The criteria for similarity are: (1) AA (Angle-Angle): If two angles of one triangle are equal to two angles of another triangle, the triangles are similar. (2) SAS (Side-Angle-Side): If one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of another triangle and the sides including these angles are proportional, the triangles are similar. (3) SSS (Side-Side-Side): If the corresponding sides of two triangles are proportional, the triangles are similar. Basic Proportionality Theorem (BPT/Thales' Theorem): If a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle intersecting the other two sides, it divides those sides in the same ratio. The converse is also true: if a line divides two sides of a triangle in the same ratio, it is parallel to the third side. For similar triangles, the ratio of their areas equals the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.",
