    "text": "Two triangles are similar if their corresponding angles are equal and their corresponding sides are in proportion. The criteria for similarity are: (1) AA (Angle-Angle): If two angles of one triangle are equal to two angles of another triangle, the triangles are similar. (2) SAS (Side-Angle-Side): If one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of another triangle and the sides including these angles are proportional, the triangles are similar. (3) SSS (Side-Side-Side): If the corresponding sides of two triangles are proportional, the triangles are similar. Basic Proportionality Theorem (BPT/Thales' Theorem): If a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle intersecting the other two sides, it divides those sides in the same ratio. The converse is also true: if a line divides two sides of a triangle in the same ratio, it is parallel to the third side. For similar triangles, the ratio of their areas equals the square of the ratio of their corresponding sides.",

      "explanation_correct": "When two triangles have all their corresponding angles equal, they are similar triangles. This is because the definition of similar triangles states that they must have equal corresponding angles, and their corresponding sides must be in proportion.",

This is one of the criteria for similarity of triangles, known as the Angle-Angle (AA) criterion. The other two criteria are Side-Angle-Side (SAS) and Side-Side-Side (SSS), which are not applicable in this case."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The triangles are not just similar, they are specifically similar by the SSS criterion. Option B) 'Triangles are similar' is incomplete, as it does not specify the similarity criterion.
