    "text": "Circles are fundamental geometric shapes with unique properties involving angles, tangents, chords, and secants. Key theorems include: (1) The angle in a semicircle is always 90°, (2) Angles subtended by the same arc in the same segment are equal, and the central angle is twice the inscribed angle, (3) Opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary (sum to 180°), (4) A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of contact, and tangents drawn from an external point to a circle are equal in length, (5) When two chords intersect inside a circle, the products of their segments are equal; when a secant and tangent are drawn from an external point, the square of the tangent equals the product of the secant and its external segment.",
