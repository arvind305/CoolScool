    "text": "Geometric constructions involve creating precise geometric figures using only a compass and straightedge (ruler without measurements). Key constructions for ICSE Class 10 include: (1) Construction of tangents to a circle from an external point - utilizing the property that a tangent is perpendicular to the radius at the point of contact; (2) Construction of a circumscribed circle (circumcircle) - the circle passing through all vertices of a polygon, found using perpendicular bisectors of sides that intersect at the circumcenter; (3) Construction of an inscribed circle (incircle) - the circle tangent to all sides of a polygon, found using angle bisectors that intersect at the incenter; (4) Combined constructions based on given conditions - requiring multiple construction techniques. All constructions must be performed using only a ruler and compass, following precise geometric principles.",
