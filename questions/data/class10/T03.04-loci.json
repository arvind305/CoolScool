    "text": "A locus is the set of all points that satisfy a given condition or set of conditions. The word 'locus' comes from Latin meaning 'place'. The plural of locus is 'loci'. In geometry, loci problems involve finding the path or region where all points satisfy specific geometric properties. Standard loci include: (1) The perpendicular bisector of a line segment - the locus of points equidistant from two fixed points; (2) The angle bisector - the locus of points equidistant from two intersecting lines; (3) A circle - the locus of points equidistant from a fixed point (center); (4) A pair of parallel lines - the locus of points equidistant from a fixed straight line. When two loci conditions are given, the solution consists of points that satisfy both conditions simultaneously, found at the intersection of the two loci.",
    "rules": [
      "The locus of points equidistant from two fixed points A and B is the perpendicular bisector of the line segment AB",
      "The locus of points equidistant from two intersecting lines is the pair of angle bisectors of the angles formed by the lines",
      "The locus of points at a fixed distance r from a fixed point O is a circle with center O and radius r",
      "The locus of points at a fixed distance d from a fixed line l is a pair of parallel lines on either side of l, each at distance d from l",
      "To find points satisfying two locus conditions, find the intersection of the two loci",
      "Construction problems involving loci require identifying the geometric condition and constructing the corresponding locus using compass and straightedge"
