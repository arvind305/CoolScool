    "text": "Surface area and volume calculations are fundamental in mensuration. For cylinders, the curved surface area is 2πrh and total surface area is 2πr(r+h), while volume is πr²h. For cones, curved surface area is πrl (where l is slant height), total surface area is πr(r+l), and volume is (1/3)πr²h. For spheres, surface area is 4πr² and volume is (4/3)πr³. For hemispheres, curved surface area is 2πr², total surface area is 3πr², and volume is (2/3)πr³. When solids are combined, total surface area excludes common surfaces while volume is the sum of individual volumes. In melting and recasting problems, volume remains constant. Capacity problems involve converting cubic units to litres (1 litre = 1000 cm³).",

      "Always identify the solid shape correctly before applying formulas",

      "Convert units consistently (1 m³ = 1000000 cm³, 1 litre = 1000 cm³)",

Since the volume remains constant when the sphere is melted and recast, the volume of the cylinder must be the same as the volume of the sphere.

Option B) 6160 litres is double the correct answer, while option C) 1540 litres is half the correct answer.
