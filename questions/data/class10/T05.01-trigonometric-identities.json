    "text": "Trigonometric identities are equations involving trigonometric ratios that are true for all values of the angles involved. The three fundamental Pythagorean identities form the foundation: (1) sin²θ + cos²θ = 1, (2) 1 + tan²θ = sec²θ, and (3) 1 + cot²θ = csc²θ. These identities are derived from the Pythagorean theorem applied to a unit circle. They are essential for simplifying trigonometric expressions, proving more complex identities, finding values of trigonometric ratios when one ratio is known, and eliminating trigonometric ratios from equations.",
    "rules": [
      "The identity sin²θ + cos²θ = 1 holds for all angles θ and can be rearranged to find sin²θ = 1 - cos²θ or cos²θ = 1 - sin²θ",
      "The identity 1 + tan²θ = sec²θ is derived by dividing sin²θ + cos²θ = 1 by cos²θ",
      "The identity 1 + cot²θ = csc²θ is derived by dividing sin²θ + cos²θ = 1 by sin²θ",
      "When proving identities, work on the more complex side to transform it into the simpler side, or transform both sides independently to arrive at the same expression",
      "Common techniques include: factoring, combining fractions, substituting identities, and converting all ratios to sine and cosine",
      "When one trigonometric ratio is given, use the fundamental identities to find other ratios, being careful about the quadrant to determine signs"
