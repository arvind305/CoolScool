    "text": "Complementary angles are two angles whose sum is 90 degrees. In trigonometry, complementary angle relations establish fundamental relationships between trigonometric ratios. The six complementary relations are: sin(90°-θ) = cos(θ), cos(90°-θ) = sin(θ), tan(90°-θ) = cot(θ), cot(90°-θ) = tan(θ), sec(90°-θ) = cosec(θ), and cosec(90°-θ) = sec(θ). These relations are derived from the fact that in a right-angled triangle, the two acute angles are complementary. These identities are powerful tools for simplifying trigonometric expressions and evaluating expressions using standard angles (0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°).",
