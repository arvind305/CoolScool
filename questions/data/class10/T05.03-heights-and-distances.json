    "text": "Heights and Distances is an application of trigonometry to solve real-world problems involving vertical and horizontal distances. The angle of elevation is the angle formed between the horizontal line and the line of sight when looking upward at an object. The angle of depression is the angle formed between the horizontal line and the line of sight when looking downward at an object. These problems typically involve right-angled triangles where we use trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent) to find unknown heights or distances. Problems may involve a single right triangle or multiple right triangles requiring multi-step solutions. Standard angle values (0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°) are commonly used for exact solutions.",

      "Angle of elevation is measured upward from the horizontal",
      "Angle of depression is measured downward from the horizontal",
      "In a right triangle, tan(θ) = opposite/adjacent = height/distance",
      "In a right triangle, sin(θ) = opposite/hypotenuse",

      "The angle of elevation from point A to B equals the angle of depression from point B to A",

      "Common angles: cos(30°) = √3/2, cos(45°) = 1/√2, cos(60°) = 1/2",
