    "text": "Heights and Distances is an application of trigonometry to solve real-world problems involving vertical and horizontal distances. The angle of elevation is the angle formed between the horizontal line and the line of sight when looking upward at an object. The angle of depression is the angle formed between the horizontal line and the line of sight when looking downward at an object. These problems typically involve right-angled triangles where we use trigonometric ratios (sine, cosine, tangent) to find unknown heights or distances. Problems may involve a single right triangle or multiple right triangles requiring multi-step solutions. Standard angle values (0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°) are commonly used for exact solutions.",

      "correct_answer": "C",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect options are not correct because they do not represent the actual height the ladder reaches on the wall. Option A) 6√2 m is incorrect because it does not take into account the angle of the ladder. Option B) 7.5√3 m is incorrect because it does not correctly apply the trigonometric ratio for the 30° angle. Option D) 5√3 m is incorrect because it is not the correct value for the height of the ladder on the wall."

This is because in a right-angled triangle with one angle at 45°, the side opposite the 45° angle is equal to the adjacent side multiplied by √2. Since the ladder is 12 m long and at a 45° angle, the height it reaches on the wall is 6√2 m.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect options are not correct because they do not correctly apply the trigonometric ratios for a 45° angle. Option A) 5√3 m is incorrect because 5√3 is not the height reached by a 12 m ladder at a 45° angle. Option B) 10 m is incorrect because the height reached is less than the full length of the ladder. Option C) 7.5√3 m is incorrect because it does not use the correct trigonometric ratio for a 45° angle."

This is because the ladder is at 60° to the ground, and in a right triangle with a 60° angle, the opposite side (the height reached on the wall) is half the length of the hypotenuse (the 15m ladder). Therefore, the height reached on the wall is 7.5√3 m.",
