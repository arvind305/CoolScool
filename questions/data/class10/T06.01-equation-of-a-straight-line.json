    "text": "A straight line in a coordinate plane can be represented by various forms of equations. The slope (m) measures the steepness of a line and is calculated as the ratio of vertical change to horizontal change between any two points. The y-intercept (c) is the point where the line crosses the y-axis. The slope-intercept form y = mx + c is the most common representation. Other important forms include the point-slope form y - y₁ = m(x - x₁) and the two-point form. Parallel lines have equal slopes (m₁ = m₂), while perpendicular lines have slopes whose product is -1 (m₁ × m₂ = -1).",

      "explanation_correct": "The equation of the line passing through the points (2, 0) and (0, 4) is y = -2x + 4. This is because the slope of the line is calculated as the change in y-coordinates divided by the change in x-coordinates, which is (4 - 0) / (0 - 2) = -2. The y-intercept is then found by substituting the slope and one of the given points into the slope-intercept form y = mx + c, resulting in y = -2x + 4.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A (y = 2x + 3) is incorrect because the slope of the line is -2, not 2. Option B (y = 4x - 3) is incorrect because the y-intercept should be 4, not -3. Option C (y = 2x + 4) is incorrect because the slope of the line is -2, not 2. The correct equation of the line is y = -2x + 4, as it has the correct slope of -2 and the correct y-intercept of 4."
