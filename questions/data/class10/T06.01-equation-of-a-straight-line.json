    "text": "A straight line in a coordinate plane can be represented by various forms of equations. The slope (m) measures the steepness of a line and is calculated as the ratio of vertical change to horizontal change between any two points. The y-intercept (c) is the point where the line crosses the y-axis. The slope-intercept form y = mx + c is the most common representation. Other important forms include the point-slope form y - y₁ = m(x - x₁) and the two-point form. Parallel lines have equal slopes (m₁ = m₂), while perpendicular lines have slopes whose product is -1 (m₁ × m₂ = -1).",

      "Slope formula: m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁) for points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂)",
      "Slope-intercept form: y = mx + c, where m is slope and c is y-intercept",
      "Point-slope form: y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)",
      "Two-point form: (y - y₁)/(y₂ - y₁) = (x - x₁)/(x₂ - x₁)",
