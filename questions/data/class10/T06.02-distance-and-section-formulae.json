    "text": "The Distance and Section Formulae are fundamental tools in coordinate geometry. The Distance Formula calculates the distance between two points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) as d = √[(x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²]. The Section Formula determines the coordinates of a point dividing a line segment joining two points in a given ratio. For internal division in the ratio m:n, the point is ((mx₂+nx₁)/(m+n), (my₂+ny₁)/(m+n)). The Mid-point Formula is a special case where the ratio is 1:1, giving the midpoint as ((x₁+x₂)/2, (y₁+y₂)/2). These formulae are extensively used to solve problems involving distances, division of line segments, proving geometric properties, and finding unknown coordinates.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The midpoint formula ((x₁+x₂)/2, (y₁+y₂)/2) gives the coordinates of the midpoint of a line segment, not the point that divides the median in a 2:1 ratio. The perpendicular distance formula is used to find the perpendicular distance between a point and a line, not to find the coordinates of a point dividing a line segment. The formula ((x₁+x₂+x₃)/3, (y₁+y₂+y₃)/3) gives the coordinates of the centroid of a triangle, not the point dividing the median in a 2:1 ratio."

Option A is the formula for the centroid of a triangle, Option C is the section formula to find a point on a line segment, and Option D is the formula for the midpoint of a line segment. None of these represent the formula to find the perpendicular distance from a vertex to the opposite side."
