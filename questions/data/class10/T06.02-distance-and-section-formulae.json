    "text": "The Distance and Section Formulae are fundamental tools in coordinate geometry. The Distance Formula calculates the distance between two points (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) as d = √[(x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²]. The Section Formula determines the coordinates of a point dividing a line segment joining two points in a given ratio. For internal division in the ratio m:n, the point is ((mx₂+nx₁)/(m+n), (my₂+ny₁)/(m+n)). The Mid-point Formula is a special case where the ratio is 1:1, giving the midpoint as ((x₁+x₂)/2, (y₁+y₂)/2). These formulae are extensively used to solve problems involving distances, division of line segments, proving geometric properties, and finding unknown coordinates.",
