  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Reflection is a transformation that produces a mirror image of a geometric figure across a line called the line of reflection. In coordinate geometry, reflections follow specific rules: (1) Reflection in the x-axis transforms (x,y) to (x,-y), (2) Reflection in the y-axis transforms (x,y) to (-x,y), (3) Reflection in the origin transforms (x,y) to (-x,-y), and (4) Reflection in the line y=x transforms (x,y) to (y,x). An invariant point is a point that remains unchanged after reflection, which occurs when the point lies on the line of reflection. Reflections preserve distances and angles, making them isometric transformations. Multiple reflections can be combined to create other transformations.",
    "rules": [
      "Reflection in x-axis: (x,y) → (x,-y)",
      "Reflection in y-axis: (x,y) → (-x,y)",
      "Reflection in origin: (x,y) → (-x,-y)",
      "Reflection in line y=x: (x,y) → (y,x)",
      "Points on the line of reflection are invariant points",
      "Reflections preserve distances between points",
      "Reflections preserve angles and shapes",
      "Two successive reflections in perpendicular axes through the origin equals reflection in the origin"
