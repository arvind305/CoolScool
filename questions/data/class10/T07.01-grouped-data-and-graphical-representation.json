  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Grouped Data and Graphical Representation is a fundamental topic in statistics that deals with organizing, presenting, and interpreting large sets of data. When data is grouped into class intervals, it becomes easier to analyze and visualize patterns. A frequency distribution table organizes data into classes with their corresponding frequencies. Class intervals can be continuous (no gaps) or discontinuous (with gaps). The class mark is the midpoint of a class interval, calculated as (lower limit + upper limit)/2. Cumulative frequency is the sum of all frequencies up to a particular class, used to create cumulative frequency tables. Graphical representations include histograms (bar graphs with no gaps showing frequency distribution), frequency polygons (line graphs connecting midpoints of class intervals), and ogives (cumulative frequency curves). Histograms use class intervals on the x-axis and frequency on the y-axis. Frequency polygons are formed by joining the midpoints of the tops of histogram bars. Ogives are smooth curves plotting cumulative frequency against upper class boundaries (for less than type) or lower class boundaries (for more than type). These graphical methods help in finding median, quartiles, and understanding data distribution patterns.",
    "rules": [
      "Class intervals should be mutually exclusive and exhaustive",
      "For continuous data, there are no gaps between class intervals",
      "For discontinuous data, adjustment is needed to make it continuous before drawing histograms",
      "Class mark = (Lower limit + Upper limit) / 2",
      "Class size = Upper limit - Lower limit",
      "Cumulative frequency is always non-decreasing",
      "In a histogram, area of bars is proportional to frequency",
      "Frequency polygon can be drawn by joining midpoints of histogram bars",
      "Ogive always has an S-shaped curve for grouped data",
      "Less than ogive is drawn using upper class boundaries",
      "More than ogive is drawn using lower class boundaries",
      "Median can be found from the intersection of less than and more than ogives",
      "The total area under a frequency polygon equals the total frequency times class width"
