  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Measures of central tendency for grouped data include mean, median, and mode. The mean can be calculated using three methods: (1) Direct method: Mean = Σ(f×x)/Σf where x is the class mark and f is frequency, (2) Assumed-mean method: Mean = A + Σ(f×d)/Σf where A is assumed mean and d = x - A, (3) Step-deviation method: Mean = A + [Σ(f×u)/Σf] × h where u = (x-A)/h and h is class width. The median is the middle value when data is arranged in order, calculated using the formula: Median = L + [(N/2 - cf)/f] × h, where L is lower boundary of median class, N is total frequency, cf is cumulative frequency before median class, f is frequency of median class, and h is class width. It can also be found graphically using an ogive (cumulative frequency curve). The mode is the most frequently occurring value, calculated using the formula: Mode = L + [(f₁ - f₀)/(2f₁ - f₀ - f₂)] × h, where L is lower boundary of modal class, f₁ is frequency of modal class, f₀ is frequency of class before modal class, f₂ is frequency of class after modal class, and h is class width. Mode can also be determined from a histogram by drawing lines from the tops of the modal class to the adjacent bars.",
    "rules": [
      "For mean calculations, class mark x = (lower limit + upper limit)/2",
      "Choose assumed mean A preferably as the class mark of the middle class for easier calculations",
      "Step-deviation method is most efficient when class widths are equal and frequencies are large numbers",
      "Median class is the class where cumulative frequency first exceeds or equals N/2",
      "Modal class is the class with the highest frequency",
      "In an ogive, median corresponds to the x-value at y = N/2",
      "Less than ogive uses upper class boundaries; greater than ogive uses lower class boundaries",
      "For interpretation, consider context: mean is affected by extreme values, median is positional, mode shows most common value",
      "Always verify that Σf equals the total number of observations",
      "Class width h must be consistent in step-deviation and median/mode formulas"
