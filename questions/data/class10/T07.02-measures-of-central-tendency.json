    "text": "Measures of central tendency for grouped data include mean, median, and mode. The mean can be calculated using three methods: (1) Direct method: Mean = Σ(f×x)/Σf where x is the class mark and f is frequency, (2) Assumed-mean method: Mean = A + Σ(f×d)/Σf where A is assumed mean and d = x - A, (3) Step-deviation method: Mean = A + [Σ(f×u)/Σf] × h where u = (x-A)/h and h is class width. The median is the middle value when data is arranged in order, calculated using the formula: Median = L + [(N/2 - cf)/f] × h, where L is lower boundary of median class, N is total frequency, cf is cumulative frequency before median class, f is frequency of median class, and h is class width. It can also be found graphically using an ogive (cumulative frequency curve). The mode is the most frequently occurring value, calculated using the formula: Mode = L + [(f₁ - f₀)/(2f₁ - f₀ - f₂)] × h, where L is lower boundary of modal class, f₁ is frequency of modal class, f₀ is frequency of class before modal class, f₂ is frequency of class after modal class, and h is class width. Mode can also be determined from a histogram by drawing lines from the tops of the modal class to the adjacent bars.",
    "rules": [
      "For mean calculations, class mark x = (lower limit + upper limit)/2",
      "Choose assumed mean A preferably as the class mark of the middle class for easier calculations",
      "Step-deviation method is most efficient when class widths are equal and frequencies are large numbers",
      "Median class is the class where cumulative frequency first exceeds or equals N/2",
      "Modal class is the class with the highest frequency",
      "In an ogive, median corresponds to the x-value at y = N/2",
      "Less than ogive uses upper class boundaries; greater than ogive uses lower class boundaries",
      "For interpretation, consider context: mean is affected by extreme values, median is positional, mode shows most common value",
      "Always verify that Σf equals the total number of observations",
      "Class width h must be consistent in step-deviation and median/mode formulas"

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation_correct": "The correct answer is A) Lines drawn from wrong corners of modal bar. This is because the mode is determined by drawing lines from the tops of the modal class to the adjacent bars on a histogram. If these lines are not drawn correctly from the right corners of the modal bar, it will result in the wrong mode being identified.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answers B, C, and D are not the primary causes of a wrong mode from a histogram. Computational errors in Σf or class boundaries, incorrect class marks, and issues with calculating cumulative frequency can affect the accuracy of other measures of central tendency like the mean and median, but they do not directly lead to an incorrect mode. The mode is visually determined from the histogram, so the main issue would be incorrectly drawing the lines from the modal bar to the adjacent bars."

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation_correct": "Computational errors in calculating the total frequency (Σf) or in determining the class boundaries can lead to inconsistent results across the different methods of calculating the mean. This is because the mean formula directly depends on these values, so any mistakes will impact the final result.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The other options, while related to the central tendency calculations, are not the primary causes of inconsistent results across the different methods. Incorrect calculation of cumulative frequency or class marks, or drawing lines from the wrong corners of the modal bar, can introduce errors, but computational errors in Σf or the class boundaries are the main factors that lead to inconsistent results across the mean, median, and mode calculations."
