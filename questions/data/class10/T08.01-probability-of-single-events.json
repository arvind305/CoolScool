    "text": "Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. In a random experiment, the sample space (S) is the set of all possible outcomes. An event (E) is a subset of the sample space. The probability of an event E is given by P(E) = n(E)/n(S), where n(E) is the number of favorable outcomes and n(S) is the total number of possible outcomes. The probability of any event lies between 0 and 1 inclusive. A sure event has probability 1, while an impossible event has probability 0. For complementary events, P(E) + P(not E) = 1. Common experiments include tossing coins, rolling dice, drawing cards from a standard 52-card deck, and selecting balls from a bag.",
    "rules": [
      "The probability of any event E is: P(E) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes",
