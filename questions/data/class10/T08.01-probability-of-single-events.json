    "text": "Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event occurring. In a random experiment, the sample space (S) is the set of all possible outcomes. An event (E) is a subset of the sample space. The probability of an event E is given by P(E) = n(E)/n(S), where n(E) is the number of favorable outcomes and n(S) is the total number of possible outcomes. The probability of any event lies between 0 and 1 inclusive. A sure event has probability 1, while an impossible event has probability 0. For complementary events, P(E) + P(not E) = 1. Common experiments include tossing coins, rolling dice, drawing cards from a standard 52-card deck, and selecting balls from a bag.",
    "rules": [
      "The probability of any event E is: P(E) = Number of favorable outcomes / Total number of possible outcomes",
      "Probability values range from 0 to 1: 0 ≤ P(E) ≤ 1",
      "For complementary events: P(E) + P(E') = 1, where E' is the complement of E",
      "P(sure event) = 1 and P(impossible event) = 0",
      "A standard deck has 52 cards: 13 cards each of 4 suits (Hearts, Diamonds, Clubs, Spades)",
      "Each suit has: Ace, 2-10, Jack, Queen, King (13 cards)",
      "Face cards are Jack, Queen, King (12 in total)",
      "A fair die has 6 equally likely outcomes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6",
      "A fair coin has 2 equally likely outcomes: Head and Tail"
