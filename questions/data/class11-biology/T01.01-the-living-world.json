    "text": "The living world encompasses the incredible diversity of life on Earth and the characteristics that distinguish living organisms from non-living matter. Living organisms exhibit defining properties such as growth, reproduction, metabolism, cellular organisation, and consciousness (or the ability to sense and respond to stimuli). Classification is a systematic method of organising this vast biodiversity into hierarchical taxonomic categories: species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, kingdom, and domain. Binomial nomenclature, introduced by Carolus Linnaeus, provides each organism with a unique two-part scientific name. Taxonomical aids such as herbaria, botanical gardens, museums, zoological parks, and taxonomic keys assist scientists in identifying and cataloguing organisms.",

This is known as intrinsic growth. In contrast, non-living objects typically grow by the accumulation of material on their surface, which is a different process.",

A genus can consist of only one species if that species is sufficiently different from other organisms to warrant its own distinct genus.

Metabolism is the term used to describe all the chemical reactions that take place in the body of an organism to keep it alive and functioning.
