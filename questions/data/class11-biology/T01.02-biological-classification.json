    "text": "Biological classification is the scientific arrangement of organisms into groups based on shared characteristics. R.H. Whittaker proposed the five-kingdom classification system in 1969, dividing all organisms into Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia based on cell structure, body organisation, mode of nutrition, reproduction, and phylogenetic relationships. Kingdom Monera includes prokaryotes such as Archaebacteria (extremophiles) and Eubacteria. Kingdom Protista comprises unicellular eukaryotes. Kingdom Fungi includes heterotrophic organisms that absorb nutrients through a network of hyphae. Viruses, viroids, prions, and lichens occupy special positions outside the five kingdoms.",

      "Whittaker's five-kingdom classification is based on cell structure, body organisation, mode of nutrition, reproduction, and phylogenetic relationships.",
      "Monera are prokaryotic; Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia are eukaryotic.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "The five-kingdom classification system was proposed by R.H. Whittaker in 1969, as he recognized that the previous two-kingdom (plants and animals) or three-kingdom (plants, animals, and fungi) systems were insufficient to accurately represent the diversity of life. Whittaker's five kingdoms - Monera, Protista, Fungi, Plantae, and Animalia - were based on key differences in cell structure, body organization, mode of nutrition, and evolutionary relationships.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The five-kingdom classification system was not proposed by Carl Linnaeus, Ernst Haeckel, or Carl Woese. Linnaeus developed the binomial nomenclature system and a two-kingdom classification (plants and animals). Haeckel proposed a three-kingdom system (Protista, Plantae, and Animalia). Woese later discovered the third domain of life, Archaea, which was not part of Whittaker's original five-kingdom system."
