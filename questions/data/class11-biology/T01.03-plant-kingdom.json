    "text": "The plant kingdom encompasses a vast diversity of organisms classified into algae, bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. Algae are simple, thalloid, autotrophic organisms primarily found in aquatic habitats, classified into Chlorophyceae (green algae), Phaeophyceae (brown algae), and Rhodophyceae (red algae). Bryophytes are the simplest land plants (amphibians of the plant kingdom) including liverworts and mosses. Pteridophytes are the first vascular plants with xylem and phloem. Gymnosperms bear naked seeds, while angiosperms produce seeds enclosed within fruits. Plants exhibit alternation of generations with haploid gametophytic and diploid sporophytic phases, manifesting as haplontic, diplontic, or haplo-diplontic life cycles.",
    "rules": [
      "Algae are classified based on pigments, stored food, and cell wall composition into Chlorophyceae, Phaeophyceae, and Rhodophyceae.",
      "Bryophytes require water for fertilisation and the dominant phase is the gametophyte.",
      "Alternation of generations involves haploid gametophyte and diploid sporophyte phases alternating in the life cycle."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Leafy gametophyte, Spore, Sporophyte (capsule), Protonema. This is wrong because the life cycle of a moss starts with the spore, which germinates into the protonema. The protonema then develops into the leafy gametophyte, which produces the sporophyte that forms the capsule containing the spores."

This is because algae are the simplest, with a thalloid body, followed by bryophytes which are the first land plants, then pteridophytes which have vascular tissues, and finally angiosperms which are the most complex with flowers, fruits, and highly differentiated tissues.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Angiosperms, Bryophytes, Algae, Pteridophytes. This is not correct because angiosperms are the most complex with flowers and fruits, not the simplest. Algae are the simplest organisms, followed by bryophytes, then pteridophytes, and finally angiosperms as the most complex in the plant kingdom."
