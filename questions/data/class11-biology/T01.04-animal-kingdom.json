    "text": "The animal kingdom is classified based on several fundamental features including levels of organisation (cellular, tissue, organ, organ-system), body symmetry (asymmetrical, radial, bilateral), germ layers (diploblastic, triploblastic), coelom (acoelomate, pseudocoelomate, coelomate), segmentation, and presence or absence of a notochord. Non-chordate phyla range from the simplest Porifera (sponges) through Cnidaria, Ctenophora, Platyhelminthes, Aschelminthes, Annelida, Arthropoda, Mollusca, to Echinodermata. Phylum Chordata is characterised by the presence of a notochord, dorsal hollow nerve cord, and pharyngeal gill slits. Vertebrate classes include Cyclostomata, Chondrichthyes, Osteichthyes, Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves, and Mammalia.",
    "rules": [
      "Animals are classified based on symmetry (radial/bilateral), germ layers (diploblastic/triploblastic), coelom type, segmentation, and presence of notochord.",
      "Diploblastic animals have two germ layers (ectoderm and endoderm); triploblastic animals have three (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm).",
      "Chordates possess a notochord, dorsal hollow nerve cord, and pharyngeal gill slits at some stage of their life."
