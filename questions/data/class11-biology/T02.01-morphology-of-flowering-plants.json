  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Morphology of flowering plants deals with the external form and structure of various plant organs. The root system anchors the plant and absorbs water and minerals, with tap roots in dicots and fibrous roots in monocots. Stems support leaves, flowers, and fruits, and may be modified for storage, support, or vegetative propagation. Leaves are the primary photosynthetic organs, showing various arrangements (phyllotaxy) and modifications. Flowers are reproductive organs with whorls: calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium. Inflorescence types, aestivation patterns, and placentation are important morphological features. Fruits develop from ovaries after fertilisation. Three important families studied are Fabaceae (pea family), Solanaceae (potato family), and Liliaceae (lily family).",
    "rules": [
      "Dicots typically have tap roots; monocots have fibrous roots.",
      "A flower consists of four whorls: calyx (sepals), corolla (petals), androecium (stamens), and gynoecium (carpels).",
      "Floral formulae use symbols to represent the symmetry, sex, number and fusion of floral parts."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Tap root systems are characteristic of dicotyledonous plants, where the primary root grows downwards and gives rise to lateral or secondary roots. This is in contrast to the fibrous root system found in monocots, where many thin roots emerge from the base of the stem.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Tap root systems are not found in monocotyledonous plants, which have a fibrous root system with many thin, thread-like roots emerging from the base of the stem. Tap roots are a feature of dicotyledonous plants, where a single primary root grows downwards and gives rise to lateral roots. Tap root systems are not found in all flowering plants, as monocots have a different root structure."
