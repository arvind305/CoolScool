  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Morphology of flowering plants deals with the external form and structure of various plant organs. The root system anchors the plant and absorbs water and minerals, with tap roots in dicots and fibrous roots in monocots. Stems support leaves, flowers, and fruits, and may be modified for storage, support, or vegetative propagation. Leaves are the primary photosynthetic organs, showing various arrangements (phyllotaxy) and modifications. Flowers are reproductive organs with whorls: calyx, corolla, androecium, and gynoecium. Inflorescence types, aestivation patterns, and placentation are important morphological features. Fruits develop from ovaries after fertilisation. Three important families studied are Fabaceae (pea family), Solanaceae (potato family), and Liliaceae (lily family).",
    "rules": [
      "Dicots typically have tap roots; monocots have fibrous roots.",
      "A flower consists of four whorls: calyx (sepals), corolla (petals), androecium (stamens), and gynoecium (carpels).",
      "Floral formulae use symbols to represent the symmetry, sex, number and fusion of floral parts."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Tap root systems are characteristic of dicotyledonous plants, where the primary root grows downwards and gives rise to lateral or secondary roots. This is in contrast to the fibrous root system found in monocots, where many thin roots emerge from the base of the stem.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Tap root systems are not found in monocotyledonous plants, which have a fibrous root system with many thin, thread-like roots emerging from the base of the stem. Tap roots are a feature of dicotyledonous plants, where a single primary root grows downwards and gives rise to lateral roots. Tap root systems are not found in all flowering plants, as monocots have a different root structure."

In free central placentation, the ovules are also on a central axis but the septa are absent, leaving the ovary as a single chamber, as seen in Dianthus and Primula. The key difference lies in the presence or absence of septa dividing the ovary.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Axile placentation does not involve ovules on the ovary wall (that describes parietal placentation) and is not basal. Free central placentation is not apical. The two types of placentation are not identical. The critical distinction is that axile placentation has septa dividing the ovary into locules, whereas free central placentation lacks septa even though ovules are borne on a central column in both."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Since the sepals, petals, and stamens all arise from below the ovary, the ovary is in a superior position (hypogynous flower). The ovules being attached to the margins of a single carpel indicates marginal placentation, which is characteristic of monocarpellary ovaries as seen in the family Fabaceae. Together, these features identify a hypogynous flower with marginal placentation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The ovary is not inferior because all other floral parts arise from below it, not above it; an inferior ovary would have floral parts appearing to arise from above. Parietal placentation involves ovules on the inner walls of a multicarpellary ovary, not on the margins of a single carpel. Free central placentation has ovules on a central axis without septa. Axile placentation involves a central axis with septa. The described arrangement of a single carpel with ovules at its margins is marginal placentation."

Onion, tulip, and lily all characteristically produce bulbs as their underground storage organs.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Allium cepa (onion) is a classic bulb-forming member of Liliaceae. Tulipa (tulip) produces a tunicate bulb. Lilium (lily) forms a scaly bulb.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "In cacti, the spines arise from leaf primordia at the nodes of the stem, occupying the exact position where leaves would normally develop. The leaves are modified into spines to reduce the surface area for transpiration (water loss) in arid environments. Meanwhile, the fleshy green stem (phylloclade) takes over the function of photosynthesis. This developmental origin from leaf primordia is why cactus spines are classified as modified leaves.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Spines of cactus are not superficial outgrowths from the epidermis; those would be prickles (like in roses), which are neither leaf nor stem modifications. Cactus spines do have vascular tissue but it is derived from the leaf vascular bundle, not the root. They are not simply dead tissue but are living, developmentally programmed structures. The key reason for their classification as leaf modifications is their origin from leaf primordia at nodes."

      "explanation_correct": "A spike is a type of racemose inflorescence in which the flowers are sessile (lacking individual stalks or pedicels) and are directly attached to the main axis (peduncle) in an acropetal succession. A raceme, by contrast, has flowers borne on distinct pedicels along the main axis. In wheat, the spikelets are sessile on the rachis, which is the defining criterion that makes it a spike rather than a raceme.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "If flowers were on long pedicels, the inflorescence would be a raceme, not a spike. Wheat does not produce a single terminal flower; it has many sessile flowers arranged along the axis. The main axis of wheat does not terminate in a flower; it is a racemose (indeterminate) type where the axis continues to grow. The classification as a spike rests specifically on the sessile nature of the flowers on the peduncle."

In tomato, the pericarp is uniformly fleshy throughout, and the fruit contains numerous seeds embedded in the pulp. A drupe, by contrast, has a hard, stony endocarp surrounding a single seed (as in mango or peach). Since tomato lacks a stony endocarp and has multiple seeds, it is classified as a berry.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Tomato does not have a single seed with a hard stony endocarp; that describes a drupe like mango. Tomato develops from a superior ovary, not an inferior one. It is not dry or dehiscent; it is fleshy and indehiscent. The distinguishing reason for classifying tomato as a berry is the entirely fleshy pericarp without a stony endocarp, combined with the presence of multiple seeds."
