  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "The internal structure of flowering plants is built from tissues that are classified as meristematic (actively dividing) and permanent (differentiated). Meristematic tissues include apical, lateral, and intercalary meristems. Permanent tissues are simple (parenchyma, collenchyma, sclerenchyma) or complex (xylem and phloem). The tissue system includes the epidermal, ground, and vascular tissue systems. Dicot and monocot roots, stems, and leaves differ in their internal anatomy, particularly in vascular bundle arrangement and the presence or absence of a cambium. Secondary growth in dicots involves the vascular cambium producing secondary xylem and phloem, and the cork cambium producing the periderm, leading to increase in girth and formation of annual rings.",
    "rules": [
      "Meristematic tissues are undifferentiated, actively dividing cells found at growing regions.",
      "Xylem transports water and minerals; phloem transports organic food (sucrose).",
      "Secondary growth occurs in dicots through the activity of vascular cambium and cork cambium, producing secondary tissues."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "The apical meristem is responsible for the increase in length of a plant. This is because the apical meristem is located at the tips of roots and shoots, and it continuously divides to add new cells, leading to the elongation of the plant.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The lateral meristem, located along the sides of the plant, is responsible for the increase in the diameter or girth of the plant, not the length. The intercalary meristem is found in the nodes of monocot plants and is responsible for the elongation of the internodes, not the overall length of the plant. The cork cambium is responsible for the formation of the protective periderm layer, not the increase in length."

Monocot leaves have isobilateral symmetry, meaning the upper and lower surfaces are symmetrical, because the mesophyll is not differentiated into distinct palisade and spongy layers.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 'radial'. The xylem and phloem bundles in a dicot root are not arranged in a concentric or scattered pattern, but rather in a radial arrangement, with the xylem at the center and the phloem surrounding it.

These annual rings are visible in the cross-section of a tree trunk and provide a record of the tree's age.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'annual rings'. The annual rings are the concentric circles visible on the cross-section of a tree trunk, which indicate the age of the tree. Each ring represents one year of growth, with the oldest rings being towards the center and the newest rings towards the outside of the trunk.
