    "text": "Animal tissues are classified into four basic types: epithelial, connective, muscular, and neural. Epithelial tissues cover body surfaces and line cavities, and include squamous, cuboidal, columnar, and glandular types. Connective tissues provide support and include loose connective tissue, dense connective tissue, cartilage, bone, and blood. Muscular tissue enables movement and includes skeletal (striated voluntary), smooth (unstriated involuntary), and cardiac muscle. Neural tissue consists of neurons and neuroglial cells that transmit nerve impulses. The morphology and anatomy of three model organisms â€” earthworm (Pheretima), cockroach (Periplaneta), and frog (Rana) â€” illustrate how organ systems work together.",
    "rules": [
      "Epithelial tissues form protective coverings and linings; they are avascular and rest on a basement membrane.",
      "Connective tissue has cells dispersed in an extracellular matrix consisting of fibres and ground substance.",
      "Neurons are the structural and functional units of the nervous system, consisting of dendrites, cell body, and axon."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'spiracles'.

This is because these disc-like structures connect the end of one cardiac muscle cell to the next, creating a continuous network that facilitates the rapid spread of electrical signals throughout the heart.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'intercalated discs'. This refers to the specialised cell-cell junctions found in cardiac muscle tissue that allow for the rapid transmission of impulses between cells.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 'poikilothermic (cold-blooded)'.
