    "text": "The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of all living organisms. Cell theory, proposed by Schleiden and Schwann and later extended by Virchow, states that all living organisms are composed of cells and that new cells arise from pre-existing cells. Cells are broadly classified as prokaryotic (lacking a membrane-bound nucleus, e.g. bacteria) and eukaryotic (with a well-defined nucleus, e.g. plant and animal cells). Eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound organelles including the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, chloroplasts (in plants), lysosomes, and ribosomes. The cell membrane follows the fluid mosaic model, consisting of a lipid bilayer with embedded proteins, facilitating selective permeability and transport.",
