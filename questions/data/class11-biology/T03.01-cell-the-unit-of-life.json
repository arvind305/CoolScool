    "text": "The cell is the fundamental structural and functional unit of all living organisms. Cell theory, proposed by Schleiden and Schwann and later extended by Virchow, states that all living organisms are composed of cells and that new cells arise from pre-existing cells. Cells are broadly classified as prokaryotic (lacking a membrane-bound nucleus, e.g. bacteria) and eukaryotic (with a well-defined nucleus, e.g. plant and animal cells). Eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound organelles including the nucleus, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, chloroplasts (in plants), lysosomes, and ribosomes. The cell membrane follows the fluid mosaic model, consisting of a lipid bilayer with embedded proteins, facilitating selective permeability and transport.",

      "explanation_correct": "Meera's model demonstrates the lateral mobility of membrane proteins within the fluid lipid bilayer, a key feature of the fluid mosaic model proposed by Singer and Nicolson (1972). In this model, the lipid bilayer behaves as a two-dimensional fluid in which both lipid molecules and proteins can move laterally. The plastic beads drifting through the oil layer mimic how integral and peripheral proteins can diffuse laterally within the phospholipid bilayer, giving the membrane its dynamic, mosaic character.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because the model demonstrates fluidity, not rigidity — the beads moved freely, showing the membrane is not rigid. Option C is incorrect because the model does not demonstrate active transport; no energy source was used to move molecules against a gradient. Option D is incorrect because the cell membrane does not synthesise proteins — protein synthesis occurs on ribosomes."

The cell theory states that all living organisms are composed of cells, that the cell is the basic structural and functional unit of life, and that all cells arise from pre-existing cells. Viruses violate these principles because they are acellular (not made of cells), they cannot carry out metabolic activities on their own, and they can only reproduce by hijacking the cellular machinery of a host cell. They are considered to be at the borderline of living and non-living.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because bacteria, though prokaryotic, are still cellular organisms and fully comply with cell theory. Option C is incorrect because plant cells are cellular and follow cell theory — having a cell wall does not make them an exception. Option D is a common misconception: mature mammalian RBCs lack a nucleus, but they still arise from nucleated precursor cells (erythroblasts), so they do not violate the cell theory."

Every prokaryote has a cell membrane that encloses the cytoplasm, 70S ribosomes for protein synthesis, and DNA as genetic material.

Option C is incorrect because mitochondria and chloroplasts as membrane-bound organelles are found only in eukaryotes, not in prokaryotes.

      "explanation_correct": "The cell membrane is described as selectively permeable because its phospholipid bilayer creates a hydrophobic barrier that prevents most polar, charged, and large molecules from freely crossing. Small nonpolar molecules (like O2, CO2) and small uncharged polar molecules (like water, to some extent) can pass through, but ions, glucose, amino acids, and other large or charged molecules require specific channel proteins, carrier proteins, or active transport mechanisms to cross. This selectivity allows the cell to maintain a distinct internal environment, regulate metabolic processes, and control the exchange of materials with the extracellular environment.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A describes a freely permeable membrane, which the cell membrane is not. Option B is incorrect because the membrane is primarily composed of phospholipids, not entirely proteins, and it does not block all substances.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "The inner mitochondrial membrane is folded into cristae to increase the surface area available for the electron transport chain (ETC) complexes (Complexes I-IV) and ATP synthase (Complex V). Since oxidative phosphorylation — the major ATP-producing process in aerobic respiration — occurs on the inner membrane, a larger surface area means more ETC complexes and ATP synthase molecules can be accommodated, resulting in greater ATP yield. Cells with high energy demands (such as cardiac muscle cells) have mitochondria with more numerous and densely packed cristae.",

Option C is incorrect because DNA is stored in the mitochondrial matrix, and the folding of the inner membrane does not create more space for DNA storage.
