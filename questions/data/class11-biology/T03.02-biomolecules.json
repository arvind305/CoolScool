    "text": "Biomolecules are the organic compounds essential for life, classified into carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Carbohydrates serve as energy sources and structural components, ranging from monosaccharides to polysaccharides. Lipids include fats, phospholipids, and steroids, functioning in energy storage and membrane structure. Proteins are polymers of amino acids linked by peptide bonds, with four levels of structural organisation (primary, secondary, tertiary, quaternary). Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) store and transmit genetic information. Enzymes are biological catalysts (mostly proteins) that lower activation energy, following the lock-and-key or induced fit models, and are affected by temperature, pH, substrate concentration, and inhibitors.",
    "rules": [
      "Carbohydrates are classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides based on the number of sugar units.",
      "Proteins have four levels of structure: primary (amino acid sequence), secondary (alpha-helix/beta-sheet), tertiary (3D folding), quaternary (multiple polypeptide assembly).",
      "Enzymes are highly specific biological catalysts whose activity depends on temperature, pH, and substrate concentration."

Starch and cellulose are both polysaccharides, which are large molecules made up of many monosaccharide units. Glucose is the correct answer as it is a monosaccharide, the simplest form of carbohydrates."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 'tertiary'. The tertiary structure is not the primary, secondary, or quaternary structure of a protein. The primary structure is the sequence of amino acids, the secondary structure refers to local folding patterns like alpha helices and beta sheets, and the quaternary structure involves the arrangement of multiple polypeptide chains in a complete protein.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'apoenzyme'. The 'apo-' prefix means 'without', so the apoenzyme is the enzyme protein itself, without the cofactor that is usually required for the enzyme to function properly.

The alpha-helix is a secondary structure of proteins where the polypeptide chain coils into a spiral shape, stabilized by hydrogen bonds.
