    "text": "The cell cycle is the sequence of events that occur in a cell from one division to the next. It consists of interphase (G1, S, and G2 phases) and the M phase (mitosis and cytokinesis). During G1, the cell grows; during S phase, DNA replication occurs; during G2, the cell prepares for division. Mitosis produces two genetically identical daughter cells through prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, followed by cytokinesis. Meiosis is a reductional division producing four haploid cells from one diploid cell, occurring in two successive divisions (meiosis I and meiosis II). Crossing over during prophase I of meiosis leads to genetic recombination, which is vital for genetic diversity in sexually reproducing organisms.",

This is an important step in meiosis that helps separate the homologous chromosomes during the subsequent anaphase I.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is diakinesis. Terminalization of chiasmata does not occur during pachytene, zygotene, or leptotene, which are the other sub-stages of prophase I. In pachytene, the homologous chromosomes pair up and genetic recombination occurs. In zygotene, the homologous chromosomes start pairing up. In leptotene, the chromosomes condense and become visible."
