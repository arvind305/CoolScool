    "text": "The cell cycle is the sequence of events that occur in a cell from one division to the next. It consists of interphase (G1, S, and G2 phases) and the M phase (mitosis and cytokinesis). During G1, the cell grows; during S phase, DNA replication occurs; during G2, the cell prepares for division. Mitosis produces two genetically identical daughter cells through prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, followed by cytokinesis. Meiosis is a reductional division producing four haploid cells from one diploid cell, occurring in two successive divisions (meiosis I and meiosis II). Crossing over during prophase I of meiosis leads to genetic recombination, which is vital for genetic diversity in sexually reproducing organisms.",

This is an important step in meiosis that helps separate the homologous chromosomes during the subsequent anaphase I.",

In leptotene, the chromosomes condense and become visible."

In reality, mitosis can occur in haploid cells as well — for example, in fungi and some algae, haploid cells divide by mitosis during vegetative growth. Mitosis simply maintains the chromosome number of the parent cell, whether that number is haploid or diploid.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A, while generally true, does not address a common misconception in the same way. Option C is the misconception itself — mitosis is not restricted to diploid cells. Option D is wrong because higher plant cells lack centrioles entirely yet still form functional spindle fibres using other microtubule organising centres."

This recombination creates new allelic combinations on chromosomes that did not exist in the parent, thereby significantly increasing genetic diversity among the gametes produced. This variation is essential for natural selection and evolution.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because crossing over involves genetic material exchange, not cytoplasm distribution. Option C is wrong because crossing over and non-disjunction are separate events; crossing over does not prevent non-disjunction.

Each daughter cell receives an identical complement of chromosomes — if the parent cell is 2n, each daughter cell is also 2n. The term 'equational' specifically refers to the maintenance of chromosome number, not to physical equality of cell size.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because mitosis does not produce gametes; that is the role of meiosis. Option C is wrong because the duration of mitosis and meiosis are unrelated to the term 'equational.' Option D is wrong because cytokinesis does not always divide the cytoplasm into perfectly equal halves, and the term 'equational' refers to chromosome number, not cytoplasmic volume."

These specialisations mean that re-entering the cell cycle and dividing would disrupt their function. Additionally, uncontrolled division of such cells could lead to pathological conditions. Therefore, they exit the cell cycle and remain in G0 permanently.",

Option C is wrong because these cells actively synthesise proteins needed for their specialised functions. Option D is wrong because G0 cells are metabolically active and perform essential roles — they are not dead."
