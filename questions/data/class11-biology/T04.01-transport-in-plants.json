    "text": "Transport in plants involves the movement of water, minerals, and food through different mechanisms. Diffusion is the passive movement of substances from higher to lower concentration. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane. Water potential determines the direction of water movement â€” water moves from higher water potential to lower water potential. Roots absorb water through osmosis via the apoplast (cell wall pathway) and symplast (cytoplasmic pathway). The ascent of sap is explained by the cohesion-tension (transpiration pull) theory. Transpiration, the loss of water vapour through stomata, creates the driving force for water movement. Translocation of food in phloem follows the pressure flow (mass flow) hypothesis.",
    "rules": [
      "Water potential (Î¨w) = Solute potential (Î¨s) + Pressure potential (Î¨p); water moves from higher to lower water potential.",
      "The cohesion-tension theory explains the ascent of sap â€” transpiration pull creates negative pressure that pulls water upward through xylem.",
      "The pressure flow hypothesis explains phloem transport â€” sucrose loading creates high osmotic pressure at the source, driving mass flow to the sink."

This happens to balance the water concentration on both sides of the membrane.",
