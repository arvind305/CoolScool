    "text": "Transport in plants involves the movement of water, minerals, and food through different mechanisms. Diffusion is the passive movement of substances from higher to lower concentration. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane. Water potential determines the direction of water movement â€” water moves from higher water potential to lower water potential. Roots absorb water through osmosis via the apoplast (cell wall pathway) and symplast (cytoplasmic pathway). The ascent of sap is explained by the cohesion-tension (transpiration pull) theory. Transpiration, the loss of water vapour through stomata, creates the driving force for water movement. Translocation of food in phloem follows the pressure flow (mass flow) hypothesis.",
    "rules": [
      "Water potential (Î¨w) = Solute potential (Î¨s) + Pressure potential (Î¨p); water moves from higher to lower water potential.",
      "The cohesion-tension theory explains the ascent of sap â€” transpiration pull creates negative pressure that pulls water upward through xylem.",
      "The pressure flow hypothesis explains phloem transport â€” sucrose loading creates high osmotic pressure at the source, driving mass flow to the sink."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Pure water > Cell sap of root hair > Soil water > Xylem sap. This is wrong because the cell sap of root hairs has a lower water potential than soil water, as the root cells actively pump out solutes to create a lower water potential to absorb water from the soil. Xylem sap has the lowest water potential as it transports water and dissolved minerals upwards in the plant."

Water moving via the apoplast is forced to cross the plasma membrane of the endodermal cells, effectively switching to the symplast route.

Phloem transport, however, is bidirectional because food (primarily sucrose) is translocated from any source (e.g., photosynthesising leaves) to any sink (e.g., roots, developing fruits, growing tips), and the direction depends on the metabolic demands of the plant at a given time.",

      "explanation_correct": "Root pressure is a positive hydrostatic pressure generated in the xylem of roots when ions are actively absorbed, lowering the water potential in root xylem and causing water to enter by osmosis. However, root pressure can only push water up to a few metres and is most evident at night or early morning (as seen in guttation). Transpiration pull, by contrast, creates a strong negative tension (up to -2 MPa or more) in the xylem due to evaporation from mesophyll cells, and this tension is transmitted through the continuous water column held together by cohesion, allowing water to ascend over 100 metres in tall trees.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "It is incorrect to say root pressure is sufficient for tall trees or that transpiration pull only works in herbs.

This high pressure drives the mass flow of phloem sap towards regions of lower pressure (sinks).",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Wind increases the rate of transpiration by removing the thin layer of saturated (humid) air that normally accumulates around the leaf surface (the boundary layer). When this layer is swept away by the fan, the difference in water vapour concentration between the substomatal air spaces and the surrounding atmosphere increases, steepening the diffusion gradient and accelerating water loss. This increased transpiration results in greater water uptake, moving the air bubble further in the potometer.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Root pressure is not affected by wind blowing over the shoot. Cooling of water in the potometer tube would not cause a unidirectional bubble movement comparable to transpiration. Stomatal aperture is primarily regulated by light, CO2 concentration, and turgor of guard cells, not directly by wind. The correct explanation centres on the removal of the boundary layer of humid air."

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Mangrove root cells actively transport and accumulate high concentrations of solutes (ions and compatible organic solutes), which makes the solute potential of their cell sap highly negative. This lowers the water potential inside the root cells to a value more negative than the surrounding saline soil. Consequently, water moves from the soil into the root by osmosis along the water potential gradient. Additionally, some mangroves have ultrafiltration mechanisms at the root membranes to exclude excess salt.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Passive diffusion alone cannot generate the very negative water potentials needed to absorb water from saline soil. Mangroves do possess a Casparian strip, and free entry of salt water would be toxic. Lenticels facilitate gas exchange, not significant water absorption from soil. The key adaptation is the active accumulation of solutes in root cells to create a sufficiently negative water potential."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "High atmospheric humidity actually decreases the rate of transpiration because it reduces the water vapour concentration gradient between the leaf's substomatal air spaces and the surrounding atmosphere. With less of a gradient, there is less driving force for water vapour to diffuse out of the stomata. In contrast, high light intensity opens stomata, high temperature increases evaporation rates, and high wind removes the humid boundary layer, all of which increase transpiration.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Students often assume that any 'high' environmental factor would increase transpiration. However, high humidity saturates the air around the leaf, reducing the vapour pressure deficit. This is the opposite effect of the other three factors listed, which all promote faster water loss from the leaf surface."

It is wholly insufficient to account for the ascent of sap in tall trees exceeding 20 metres, where heights can reach over 100 metres. The cohesion-tension (transpiration pull) theory is the accepted primary mechanism for the ascent of sap in tall trees. The other statements are correct: root pressure arises from active ion absorption, is demonstrated by guttation, and is most noticeable when transpiration is minimal.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Students commonly overestimate the contribution of root pressure. While root pressure plays a supplementary role and is important for re-establishing xylem water columns in spring (especially in deciduous trees), it cannot drive water to the heights required in tall trees. Transpiration pull, not root pressure, is the dominant force."

      "explanation_incorrect": "A common misconception is that because facilitated diffusion uses proteins, it must be able to move substances against the gradient like active transport.

This lowers the chemical potential (free energy) of the water compared to pure water, which is assigned a water potential of zero. Since the addition of any solute can only reduce the free energy of water below that reference point of zero, solute potential is always negative or zero (for pure water with no solutes).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Dissolved solutes do not increase the free energy of water; they reduce it. Solute potential is not related to physical pressure on the cell wall (that is pressure potential). The acidity of solutes is irrelevant to the thermodynamic basis of solute potential.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Sucrose is a non-reducing disaccharide because its glycosidic bond links the anomeric carbons of both glucose and fructose, leaving no free aldehyde or ketone group. This makes sucrose chemically less reactive than reducing sugars like glucose during transit through the phloem. If a reducing sugar were transported, it could participate in unwanted reactions (such as with amino acids in Maillard-type reactions or be metabolised by sieve tube elements), leading to loss of transported carbon. Sucrose therefore provides a stable, energy-efficient form of carbon for long-distance translocation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Sucrose (a disaccharide, MW 342) is actually larger than glucose (MW 180), so size is not the reason. Glucose is readily soluble in water and is abundant in the cytoplasm, so insolubility is not an issue. Glucose is used in many metabolic pathways, not exclusively in cell wall synthesis.

No membranes need to be crossed. In contrast, the symplast pathway requires water to move through the living cytoplasm and pass through plasmodesmata, which are narrow cytoplasmic channels (typically 20-50 nm in diameter). These narrow passages and the need to traverse or interact with membranes offer greater resistance to water movement, making the symplast route comparatively slower in the cortex.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Aquaporins are present in cell membranes (symplast), not in the non-living apoplast. The apoplast is a passive pathway and does not use ATP.
