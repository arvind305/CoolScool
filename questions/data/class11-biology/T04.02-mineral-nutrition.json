    "text": "Mineral nutrition encompasses the study of essential elements required by plants for their growth and development. Essential elements are classified as macronutrients (required in larger amounts, e.g. N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S) and micronutrients (required in trace amounts, e.g. Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Mo, B, Cl, Ni). The criteria of essentiality state that an element must be indispensable for normal growth, its role must not be replaceable by another element, and it must be directly involved in plant metabolism. Deficiency of essential elements leads to characteristic symptoms like chlorosis, necrosis, and stunted growth. Nitrogen metabolism involves the nitrogen cycle, including nitrogen fixation by Rhizobium (symbiotic) and free-living bacteria, nitrification, and denitrification.",
    "rules": [
      "An essential element must satisfy three criteria: it is absolutely necessary, its role cannot be replaced, and it is directly involved in metabolism.",
      "Macronutrients are needed in concentrations above 10 mmol/kg dry weight; micronutrients below 10 mmol/kg.",
      "Biological nitrogen fixation converts atmospheric N2 to NH3 using the nitrogenase enzyme, which requires anaerobic conditions."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The deficiency symptoms described do not match those of nitrogen, phosphorus, or sulfur. Nitrogen deficiency leads to general chlorosis and stunted growth, phosphorus deficiency causes dark green leaves and poor root growth, and sulfur deficiency results in overall yellowing of the plant. Die-back of shoot tips is specifically a symptom of copper deficiency."
