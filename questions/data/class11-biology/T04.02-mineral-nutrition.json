    "text": "Mineral nutrition encompasses the study of essential elements required by plants for their growth and development. Essential elements are classified as macronutrients (required in larger amounts, e.g. N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S) and micronutrients (required in trace amounts, e.g. Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Mo, B, Cl, Ni). The criteria of essentiality state that an element must be indispensable for normal growth, its role must not be replaceable by another element, and it must be directly involved in plant metabolism. Deficiency of essential elements leads to characteristic symptoms like chlorosis, necrosis, and stunted growth. Nitrogen metabolism involves the nitrogen cycle, including nitrogen fixation by Rhizobium (symbiotic) and free-living bacteria, nitrification, and denitrification.",
    "rules": [
      "An essential element must satisfy three criteria: it is absolutely necessary, its role cannot be replaced, and it is directly involved in metabolism.",
      "Macronutrients are needed in concentrations above 10 mmol/kg dry weight; micronutrients below 10 mmol/kg.",
      "Biological nitrogen fixation converts atmospheric N2 to NH3 using the nitrogenase enzyme, which requires anaerobic conditions."

Calcium is a macronutrient that plays a crucial structural role as calcium pectate in the middle lamella of cell walls and is important for membrane stability. Its deficiency leads to distorted growth, necrosis, and poor root development.",

Option B (magnesium) is wrong because magnesium is the central atom in chlorophyll and its deficiency causes interveinal chlorosis, not the described structural symptoms. Option D (iron) is incorrect because iron is a micronutrient (not macronutrient) and its deficiency causes interveinal chlorosis in young leaves."

This is frequently confused with iron deficiency, which also causes interveinal chlorosis but in younger leaves. The key distinction is leaf age: magnesium is mobile (symptoms in older leaves), whereas iron is immobile (symptoms in younger leaves). Since magnesium is a macronutrient, this symptom is actually a macronutrient deficiency problem.",

Eukaryotic organisms never evolved or acquired these genes. This is why all biological nitrogen fixation is exclusively carried out by prokaryotes. The extreme oxygen sensitivity of nitrogenase and the high energy demand (16 ATP per N2 molecule) further constrain this ability to specialised prokaryotes with appropriate protective mechanisms.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because eukaryotes do have ribosomes and can synthesise complex enzymes. Option B is incorrect because ATP abundance is not the reason — in fact, nitrogen fixation requires a large amount of ATP (16 ATP per N2 reduced), which is energetically costly. Option D is wrong because no organism can directly absorb atmospheric N2 through membranes without enzymatic conversion."

Molybdenum satisfies all three criteria — it is a critical cofactor for the enzymes nitrate reductase (needed for nitrogen assimilation) and nitrogenase (needed for nitrogen fixation). Without molybdenum, plants cannot effectively utilise nitrate, leading to nitrogen deficiency symptoms and conditions like whiptail disease.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because the criteria of essentiality specifically require that the element's role cannot be replaced by another element. Option C is incorrect because soil abundance does not determine essentiality — essentiality depends on the element's direct role in plant metabolism. Option D is wrong because molybdenum deficiency does produce visible symptoms, such as whiptail disease in cauliflower."

      "explanation_correct": "When manganese is present in excess (toxic) concentrations, it competes with other divalent cations — iron (Fe2+), magnesium (Mg2+), and calcium (Ca2+) — for the same transport proteins and absorption sites on root cell membranes. This competitive inhibition reduces the uptake of these essential elements, leading to their deficiency symptoms even when they are present in adequate amounts in the soil. This phenomenon demonstrates how mineral toxicity can cause secondary deficiencies.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because manganese does not chemically destroy other elements in the soil. Option C is incorrect because minerals do not get converted to gaseous forms by manganese. Option D is wrong because manganese toxicity inhibits rather than stimulates growth, and the mechanism of induced deficiency is competitive absorption, not excessive utilisation."
