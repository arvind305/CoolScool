    "text": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants convert light energy into chemical energy, synthesising organic molecules from CO2 and water. It occurs in chloroplasts and involves light reactions (in thylakoid membranes) and the Calvin cycle (in stroma). Light reactions include Photosystem II and Photosystem I, which drive electron transport, producing ATP (photophosphorylation) and NADPH. The Calvin cycle (C3 pathway) fixes CO2 into three-carbon compounds using RuBisCO. C4 plants have an additional Hatch-Slack pathway with Kranz anatomy to concentrate CO2. Photorespiration is a wasteful process occurring in C3 plants when RuBisCO fixes O2 instead of CO2. Factors affecting photosynthesis include light intensity, CO2 concentration, temperature, and water availability.",
    "rules": [
      "Light reactions occur in thylakoids: PS II splits water (photolysis), and electron transport produces ATP and NADPH.",
      "The Calvin cycle fixes CO2 using RuBisCO through three stages: carboxylation, reduction, and regeneration of RuBP.",
      "C4 plants avoid photorespiration by initially fixing CO2 into a 4-carbon compound (OAA) in mesophyll cells using PEP carboxylase."

In fact, it is a wasteful process that occurs when RuBisCO fixes oxygen instead of CO2, releasing CO2 without any gain in ATP or NADPH.

RuBP is the CO2 acceptor molecule that is consumed (not produced) in the carboxylation step, so fresh RuBP would not carry the 14C label initially.

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "At high temperatures (above 40 degrees C), the solubility of CO2 decreases relative to O2, and RuBisCO's oxygenase activity increases significantly in C3 plants like wheat, leading to high rates of photorespiration and reduced net CO2 fixation. Maize, being a C4 plant, uses PEP carboxylase for initial CO2 fixation, which has no oxygenase activity. The CO2 is then concentrated in bundle sheath cells, ensuring RuBisCO operates efficiently. Thus Priya would find that maize maintains a much higher net CO2 fixation rate under hot conditions.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because C3 and C4 plants respond differently to high temperatures due to differences in photorespiration rates. Option B reverses the reality -- C3 plants like wheat suffer more from photorespiration at high temperatures. Option D is incorrect because both plants can still photosynthesise at 40 degrees C, although the C3 plant's net fixation drops substantially due to photorespiration."

      "explanation_correct": "According to Blackman's law of limiting factors, when one factor (light intensity) is increased beyond the point where another factor becomes limiting, the rate of photosynthesis plateaus. In Rohan's experiment, once light intensity is no longer limiting, the dissolved CO2 concentration in the water becomes the factor present in the least favourable amount, limiting the rate of photosynthesis. The bubble rate (O2 release) stops increasing because the Calvin cycle cannot fix CO2 any faster due to insufficient CO2 supply.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because light is no longer the limiting factor once the plateau is reached -- Blackman's law states that the factor in least favourable supply determines the rate. Option C is irrelevant as beaker colour does not affect dissolved CO2 availability at high light. Option D is incorrect because water volume does not directly limit the photosynthetic rate in this context."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "When CO2 supply is removed, the carboxylation step (RuBisCO combining CO2 with RuBP to form 3-PGA) stops. However, the reduction and regeneration phases of the Calvin cycle continue as long as ATP and NADPH from the ongoing light reactions are available. This means existing 3-PGA continues to be reduced to G3P and then regenerated back to RuBP, but no new 3-PGA is formed. As a result, RuBP accumulates because it is being regenerated but not consumed, while 3-PGA levels drop because it is being used up but not replenished.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because 3-PGA cannot increase without CO2 fixation producing new molecules. Option C reverses the actual outcome -- RuBP rises because regeneration continues while carboxylation stops. Option D is incorrect because the cessation of one step while others continue will shift the concentrations of intermediates."

In reality, the Calvin cycle does not directly require light photons, but it is entirely dependent on ATP and NADPH, which are produced by the light reactions. Since ATP and NADPH are generated only when light is available, the Calvin cycle operates primarily during the daytime. At night, without fresh ATP and NADPH supply, the Calvin cycle slows down and stops.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "The misconception arises because students focus on the additional Hatch-Slack (C4) pathway and assume it replaces the Calvin cycle. In reality, C4 plants perform both pathways. The C4 pathway in mesophyll cells is only the initial CO2-concentrating mechanism. The fixed carbon (as malate or aspartate) is transported to bundle sheath cells, where CO2 is released and enters the Calvin cycle catalysed by RuBisCO. The Calvin cycle is essential in C4 plants for the actual synthesis of sugars.",

Additionally, NADP+ reduction on the stroma side consumes H+ from the stroma. Together, these processes create the proton motive force that drives ATP synthase.",
