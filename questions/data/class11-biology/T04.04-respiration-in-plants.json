    "text": "Cellular respiration is the process by which plants break down organic molecules to release energy as ATP. It involves glycolysis (in cytoplasm), the TCA/Krebs cycle (in mitochondrial matrix), and oxidative phosphorylation via the electron transport system (on inner mitochondrial membrane). Glycolysis converts glucose into two molecules of pyruvate, yielding a net gain of 2 ATP and 2 NADH. Under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate undergoes fermentation (alcoholic or lactic acid). The Krebs cycle completely oxidises acetyl-CoA, producing CO2, NADH, FADH2, and GTP. The ETS transfers electrons from NADH and FADH2 to O2 via a series of carriers, creating a proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis (chemiosmosis). The respiratory quotient (RQ) varies depending on the substrate oxidised. Respiration pathways are amphibolic, serving both catabolic and anabolic functions.",
    "rules": [
      "Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm and produces 2 pyruvate, 2 ATP (net), and 2 NADH per glucose molecule.",
      "The complete oxidation of one glucose molecule through aerobic respiration theoretically yields 36-38 ATP.",
      "The respiratory quotient (RQ) = CO2 evolved / O2 consumed; RQ is 1 for carbohydrates, less than 1 for fats, and greater than 1 for organic acids."

Glycolysis and the Krebs cycle are earlier stages of cellular respiration, while fermentation is an anaerobic process that occurs in the absence of oxygen. Cyanide's primary mode of toxicity is by inhibiting the electron transport chain, specifically the cytochrome c oxidase enzyme, which is essential for the final step of oxidative phosphorylation."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct order from highest to lowest ATP yield per glucose is: Aerobic respiration, Lactic acid fermentation, Alcoholic fermentation. Aerobic respiration has the highest ATP yield because it completely oxidizes glucose through the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain, yielding around 36-38 ATP.

Carbohydrates have an RQ of 1 because they already contain oxygen in their structure, requiring equal volumes of O2 consumed and CO2 produced.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The RQ value reflects the chemical composition of the substrate being oxidized. Fats do not produce more CO2 per oxygen consumed; rather, they consume more oxygen relative to CO2 production because of their highly reduced state.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Cytochrome c oxidase (Complex IV) is the final enzyme in the electron transport chain that transfers electrons to oxygen. Blocking it would prevent the entire electron transport chain from functioning, stopping the proton gradient formation and thus halting oxidative phosphorylation. However, glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm and does not require the electron transport chain, so it could continue producing its 2 ATP per glucose through substrate-level phosphorylation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Blocking a crucial step in the electron transport chain cannot increase ATP production. The Krebs cycle would eventually slow down as NADH and FADH2 accumulate with nowhere to transfer their electrons, but the immediate effect is on the ETS and oxidative phosphorylation. This scenario demonstrates the critical dependence of aerobic ATP production on an intact electron transport chain."

        }
      ],
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation_correct": "Initially, more sugar provides more substrate for the yeast, potentially increasing fermentation rate. However, as fermentation proceeds, ethanol accumulates. High ethanol concentrations (typically above 12-15%) become toxic to yeast cells, inhibiting their enzymes and eventually killing them. This is why naturally fermented beverages have alcohol content limits. Additionally, very high sugar concentrations can create osmotic stress on yeast cells.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Doubling sugar would not immediately stop fermentation or switch the pathway from alcoholic to lactic acid fermentation - yeast exclusively performs alcoholic fermentation. While fermentation releases some energy as heat, the temperature increase would not be dramatic, especially in an open system. The key consideration is the self-limiting nature of alcoholic fermentation due to ethanol toxicity."

All other options - Krebs cycle, acetyl CoA oxidation, and pyruvate conversion - genuinely occur in the mitochondrial matrix.",

All other options correctly describe fermentation - it is anaerobic, produces 2 ATP, and importantly regenerates NAD+ so glycolysis can continue.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Many students incorrectly assume fermentation requires mitochondria because it is part of cellular energy metabolism. However, fermentation evolved before mitochondria existed and occurs entirely in the cytoplasm.

When oxidized, they produce more CO2 relative to O2 consumed. This is a common misconception - students may think all acids have low RQ values. Fatty acids, triglycerides, and oil-rich seeds all have RQ values less than 1 (around 0.7) due to their highly reduced state.",

Each carrier in the chain undergoes oxidation (loses electrons) while simultaneously the next carrier undergoes reduction (gains electrons). This coupling of redox reactions allows stepwise energy release, which is used to pump protons across the membrane. The term 'electron transport' can be misleading - it is the sequential redox chemistry that makes energy extraction possible.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The ETS involves both oxidation and reduction reactions, not just one or the other. Its location in mitochondria does not define its chemical nature. ATP is produced indirectly through the proton gradient, not directly in the ETS.

While the primary function is catabolic (breaking down glucose for energy), key intermediates can be diverted for anabolic purposes. For example, alpha-ketoglutarate can be used to synthesize glutamate and other amino acids, oxaloacetate can form aspartate, and acetyl CoA can be used for fatty acid synthesis. This dual nature - serving both degradation and biosynthesis - is precisely what 'amphibolic' means.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Producing both ATP and NADH does not make a pathway amphibolic - that just means it captures energy. Location is irrelevant to the amphibolic nature.

      "explanation_correct": "The fundamental reason for lower ATP yield in anaerobic respiration is incomplete oxidation. In fermentation, glucose is only broken down to lactate or ethanol, which still contain significant chemical energy in their bonds. Without oxygen to accept electrons, the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain cannot operate, preventing the extraction of the majority of the energy. Aerobic respiration completely oxidizes glucose to CO2 and H2O, releasing nearly all the available energy (36-38 ATP vs. 2 ATP).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "While anaerobic respiration does occur in the cytoplasm and produces byproducts, these are not the fundamental reasons for low ATP yield. Different enzymes are involved, but that alone does not explain the energy difference.
