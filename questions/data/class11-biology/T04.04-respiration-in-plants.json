    "text": "Cellular respiration is the process by which plants break down organic molecules to release energy as ATP. It involves glycolysis (in cytoplasm), the TCA/Krebs cycle (in mitochondrial matrix), and oxidative phosphorylation via the electron transport system (on inner mitochondrial membrane). Glycolysis converts glucose into two molecules of pyruvate, yielding a net gain of 2 ATP and 2 NADH. Under anaerobic conditions, pyruvate undergoes fermentation (alcoholic or lactic acid). The Krebs cycle completely oxidises acetyl-CoA, producing CO2, NADH, FADH2, and GTP. The ETS transfers electrons from NADH and FADH2 to O2 via a series of carriers, creating a proton gradient that drives ATP synthesis (chemiosmosis). The respiratory quotient (RQ) varies depending on the substrate oxidised. Respiration pathways are amphibolic, serving both catabolic and anabolic functions.",
    "rules": [
      "Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm and produces 2 pyruvate, 2 ATP (net), and 2 NADH per glucose molecule.",
      "The complete oxidation of one glucose molecule through aerobic respiration theoretically yields 36-38 ATP.",
      "The respiratory quotient (RQ) = CO2 evolved / O2 consumed; RQ is 1 for carbohydrates, less than 1 for fats, and greater than 1 for organic acids."

Glycolysis and the Krebs cycle are earlier stages of cellular respiration, while fermentation is an anaerobic process that occurs in the absence of oxygen. Cyanide's primary mode of toxicity is by inhibiting the electron transport chain, specifically the cytochrome c oxidase enzyme, which is essential for the final step of oxidative phosphorylation."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order of electron carriers in the electron transport system is Complex I (NADH dehydrogenase), Complex III (cytochrome bc1), Cytochrome c, and Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase). This is because the electrons flow from Complex I to III to Cytochrome c and finally to Complex IV, where they are passed to oxygen to form water.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Cytochrome c, Complex I (NADH dehydrogenase), Complex III (cytochrome bc1), and Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase). This is wrong because the electrons flow from Complex I to Complex III, then to Cytochrome c, and finally to Complex IV. The order of the complexes is important to maintain the correct sequence of electron transfer in the electron transport system."

      ],
      "explanation_correct": "Aerobic respiration has the highest ATP yield per glucose at 36-38 ATP, followed by lactic acid fermentation at 2 ATP, and alcoholic fermentation at 2 ATP. This is because aerobic respiration completely oxidizes glucose through the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain, while fermentation pathways only partially oxidize glucose and produce much less ATP.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct order from highest to lowest ATP yield per glucose is: Aerobic respiration, Lactic acid fermentation, Alcoholic fermentation. Aerobic respiration has the highest ATP yield because it completely oxidizes glucose through the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain, yielding around 36-38 ATP. Lactic acid fermentation and alcoholic fermentation both only partially oxidize glucose, producing 2 ATP each, which is much less than aerobic respiration."
