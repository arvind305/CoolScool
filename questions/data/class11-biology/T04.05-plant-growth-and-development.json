    "text": "Plant growth is an irreversible permanent increase in size, involving cell division, cell elongation, and cell differentiation. Growth occurs in three phases: meristematic (cell division), elongation (cell enlargement), and maturation (differentiation). Growth rate can be arithmetic (constant increment) or geometric (exponential). Plant growth regulators (PGRs) are small organic molecules that influence growth. The five major classes are: auxins (promote cell elongation, apical dominance), gibberellins (promote stem elongation, seed germination), cytokinins (promote cell division, delay senescence), ethylene (fruit ripening, abscission), and abscisic acid (ABA â€” stress hormone, induces dormancy). Photoperiodism is the response of plants to the relative length of day and night, classifying plants as short-day, long-day, or day-neutral. Vernalisation is the requirement of cold treatment to induce flowering.",
    "rules": [
      "Growth in plants is open and indeterminate due to the presence of meristems.",
      "Auxins, gibberellins, and cytokinins are growth promoters; ABA is a growth inhibitor; ethylene promotes fruit ripening and senescence.",
      "Photoperiodism depends on the duration of the dark period (critical night length) rather than the light period."

      "explanation_correct": "Growth in plants is indeterminate and open due to the presence of meristems, which are regions of actively dividing cells that allow the plant to continuously grow and develop new tissues. This is in contrast to a determinate and closed growth pattern, where growth is limited and the size is fixed.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Growth in plants is not limited to the embryonic stage, as plants continue to grow and develop throughout their lifetime. Additionally, growth is not only in the dark, as plants require light for photosynthesis and other essential processes that support growth and development."

The term 'stress hormone' captures its role as a signal for stress adaptation, not merely growth inhibition.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because ABA acts on all plant organs at various developmental stages, not just seeds. Option C is wrong because ABA inhibits cell elongation, it does not promote it. Option D is incorrect because ABA is a terpenoid compound with no chemical similarity to cortisol, a steroid.

      "explanation_correct": "Plant growth is described as 'open' because new organs (leaves, branches, roots) can be added throughout life, and 'indeterminate' because growth continues indefinitely without a fixed final body plan. This is possible because plants retain meristems — regions of permanently embryonic, undifferentiated cells — at their root tips, shoot apices, and in lateral positions (vascular cambium, cork cambium). These meristems can continuously produce new cells, unlike most animal tissues where growth is determinate and ceases at maturity.",

      "explanation_correct": "Vernalisation is classified as a developmental response because it involves a specific, quantitative requirement for prolonged cold exposure (typically 0-5 degrees Celsius for several weeks) that triggers epigenetic modifications in flowering genes such as FLC (FLOWERING LOCUS C). These changes enable the plant to become competent to flower in the subsequent warm season. This is a genetically programmed developmental switch, not a random stress response or damage repair. Plants that require vernalisation (e.g., winter wheat, biennials like carrots and beets) have evolved this mechanism to synchronise flowering with favourable spring conditions.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because vernalisation temperatures (0-5 degrees Celsius) do not damage the plant; they provide a developmental signal. Option C is wrong because vernalisation is characteristic of temperate plants, not tropical ones. Option D contradicts the definition of vernalisation, which specifically involves cold treatment.
