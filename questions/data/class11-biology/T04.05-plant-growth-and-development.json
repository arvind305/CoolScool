    "text": "Plant growth is an irreversible permanent increase in size, involving cell division, cell elongation, and cell differentiation. Growth occurs in three phases: meristematic (cell division), elongation (cell enlargement), and maturation (differentiation). Growth rate can be arithmetic (constant increment) or geometric (exponential). Plant growth regulators (PGRs) are small organic molecules that influence growth. The five major classes are: auxins (promote cell elongation, apical dominance), gibberellins (promote stem elongation, seed germination), cytokinins (promote cell division, delay senescence), ethylene (fruit ripening, abscission), and abscisic acid (ABA â€” stress hormone, induces dormancy). Photoperiodism is the response of plants to the relative length of day and night, classifying plants as short-day, long-day, or day-neutral. Vernalisation is the requirement of cold treatment to induce flowering.",
    "rules": [
      "Growth in plants is open and indeterminate due to the presence of meristems.",
      "Auxins, gibberellins, and cytokinins are growth promoters; ABA is a growth inhibitor; ethylene promotes fruit ripening and senescence.",
      "Photoperiodism depends on the duration of the dark period (critical night length) rather than the light period."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Growth in plants is indeterminate and open due to the presence of meristems, which are regions of actively dividing cells that allow the plant to continuously grow and develop new tissues. This is in contrast to a determinate and closed growth pattern, where growth is limited and the size is fixed.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Growth in plants is not limited to the embryonic stage, as plants continue to grow and develop throughout their lifetime. Additionally, growth is not only in the dark, as plants require light for photosynthesis and other essential processes that support growth and development."

      "explanation_correct": "Wheat is a long-day plant, meaning it requires a longer duration of daylight (more than 12 hours) to flower and set seed. This makes option B the correct answer, as long-day plants like wheat induce flowering during the longer days of spring and summer.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Wheat is not a short-day plant, as it does not require fewer than 12 hours of daylight to flower. Wheat is also not a day-neutral plant, as its flowering is influenced by the length of daylight. Additionally, wheat is not a CAM (Crassulacean Acid Metabolism) plant, which is a type of plant adapted to hot, dry environments. Wheat is instead a long-day plant, requiring longer periods of daylight to induce flowering."
