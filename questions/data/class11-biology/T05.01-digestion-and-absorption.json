    "text": "Digestion is the process of breaking down complex food molecules into simpler absorbable forms. The human alimentary canal extends from the mouth to the anus and includes the oral cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum), large intestine, and rectum. Digestive glands include salivary glands, gastric glands, liver, pancreas, and intestinal glands. Salivary amylase begins starch digestion in the mouth. Pepsin digests proteins in the acidic stomach. The pancreas secretes trypsin, lipase, and amylase into the duodenum. Bile from the liver emulsifies fats. Absorption of digested food occurs mainly through the villi and microvilli of the small intestine via diffusion, osmosis, and active transport.",
    "rules": [
      "Digestion involves mechanical (chewing, churning) and chemical (enzymatic) breakdown of food.",
      "The small intestine is the primary site of digestion and absorption, with its large surface area enhanced by villi and microvilli.",
      "Each digestive enzyme has an optimal pH: salivary amylase (pH ~6.8), pepsin (pH ~2), trypsin (pH ~8)."

      "explanation_correct": "The stomach produces highly acidic HCl (pH 1.5-2.5) and the proteolytic enzyme pepsin, both of which could damage the stomach wall itself. The thick alkaline mucus lining acts as a protective barrier, preventing autodigestion of the gastric mucosa. Damage to this mucus barrier can lead to gastric ulcers.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The mucus lining is not primarily for increasing absorption surface area (that is the role of villi in the small intestine), slowing food movement, or aiding enzyme secretion. Its critical function is to protect the stomach wall from the corrosive effects of its own acidic and enzymatic secretions."
