    "text": "Digestion is the process of breaking down complex food molecules into simpler absorbable forms. The human alimentary canal extends from the mouth to the anus and includes the oral cavity, pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum), large intestine, and rectum. Digestive glands include salivary glands, gastric glands, liver, pancreas, and intestinal glands. Salivary amylase begins starch digestion in the mouth. Pepsin digests proteins in the acidic stomach. The pancreas secretes trypsin, lipase, and amylase into the duodenum. Bile from the liver emulsifies fats. Absorption of digested food occurs mainly through the villi and microvilli of the small intestine via diffusion, osmosis, and active transport.",
    "rules": [
      "Digestion involves mechanical (chewing, churning) and chemical (enzymatic) breakdown of food.",
      "The small intestine is the primary site of digestion and absorption, with its large surface area enhanced by villi and microvilli.",
      "Each digestive enzyme has an optimal pH: salivary amylase (pH ~6.8), pepsin (pH ~2), trypsin (pH ~8)."
