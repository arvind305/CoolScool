    "text": "The human respiratory system includes the nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli in the lungs. Breathing involves inspiration (inhalation) and expiration (exhalation), driven by the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. Lung volumes and capacities include tidal volume, inspiratory reserve volume, expiratory reserve volume, residual volume, vital capacity, and total lung capacity. Gas exchange occurs at the alveolar surface by diffusion. Oxygen is transported primarily bound to haemoglobin (as oxyhaemoglobin), while CO2 is transported as bicarbonate ions (~70%), carbamino compounds (~23%), and dissolved in plasma (~7%). The oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve is sigmoidal. Respiration is regulated by the respiratory centre in the medulla oblongata.",
    "rules": [
      "Gas exchange at the alveolar surface occurs by diffusion, driven by partial pressure gradients of O2 and CO2.",
      "Haemoglobin can bind up to four O2 molecules; binding is cooperative, producing a sigmoidal dissociation curve.",
      "CO2 is mainly transported as bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) formed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase in RBCs."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The Bohr effect does not increase haemoglobin's affinity for oxygen. In fact, it has the opposite effect - increased CO2 or decreased pH causes haemoglobin to release oxygen more easily to the tissues that need it.

This is because the respiratory centre in the brain monitors CO2 levels, and higher CO2 indicates a need for more efficient gas exchange to remove excess CO2 and take in more oxygen.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 'carbonic anhydrase'. This enzyme is crucial for the transport of carbon dioxide in the body.

Emphysema is a lung disease that damages the alveoli, which are the tiny air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange occurs. This leads to a decreased surface area for oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange, making breathing more difficult.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'emphysema'. Emphysema is a chronic lung disease where the alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs are damaged and destroyed, usually due to long-term exposure to irritants like cigarette smoke.

The vital capacity is not the same as the tidal volume, which is the normal volume of air inhaled and exhaled during each breathing cycle.
