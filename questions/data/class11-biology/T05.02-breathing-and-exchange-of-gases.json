    "text": "The human respiratory system includes the nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli in the lungs. Breathing involves inspiration (inhalation) and expiration (exhalation), driven by the diaphragm and intercostal muscles. Lung volumes and capacities include tidal volume, inspiratory reserve volume, expiratory reserve volume, residual volume, vital capacity, and total lung capacity. Gas exchange occurs at the alveolar surface by diffusion. Oxygen is transported primarily bound to haemoglobin (as oxyhaemoglobin), while CO2 is transported as bicarbonate ions (~70%), carbamino compounds (~23%), and dissolved in plasma (~7%). The oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve is sigmoidal. Respiration is regulated by the respiratory centre in the medulla oblongata.",
    "rules": [
      "Gas exchange at the alveolar surface occurs by diffusion, driven by partial pressure gradients of O2 and CO2.",
      "Haemoglobin can bind up to four O2 molecules; binding is cooperative, producing a sigmoidal dissociation curve.",
      "CO2 is mainly transported as bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) formed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase in RBCs."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The Bohr effect does not increase haemoglobin's affinity for oxygen. In fact, it has the opposite effect - increased CO2 or decreased pH causes haemoglobin to release oxygen more easily to the tissues that need it.

This is because the respiratory centre in the brain monitors CO2 levels, and higher CO2 indicates a need for more efficient gas exchange to remove excess CO2 and take in more oxygen.

Emphysema is a lung disease that damages the alveoli, which are the tiny air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange occurs.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'emphysema'. Emphysema is a chronic lung disease where the alveoli (air sacs) in the lungs are damaged and destroyed, usually due to long-term exposure to irritants like cigarette smoke.

        {"id": "A", "text": "Because O2 is not present in the blood at all"},
        {"id": "B", "text": "Because even small increases in blood CO2 cause significant pH changes that are detected by chemoreceptors, providing a more sensitive and rapid feedback mechanism than O2 levels"},

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "CO2 is the primary stimulus because small changes in blood CO2 levels cause significant changes in blood pH (via carbonic acid formation). Chemoreceptors in the medulla and in the aortic and carotid bodies are highly sensitive to these pH changes. O2 levels remain relatively stable until severely depleted, making CO2/pH a much more sensitive and responsive regulatory signal.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "O2 is present in blood and its levels do change, but chemoreceptors are much more sensitive to CO2/pH changes. The respiratory centre can detect O2 levels through peripheral chemoreceptors, but this is a secondary mechanism. CO2's rapid effect on blood pH makes it the more effective and primary regulatory signal."
