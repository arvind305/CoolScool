    "text": "Body fluids include blood and lymph. Blood consists of plasma (55%) and formed elements (45%): RBCs (erythrocytes), WBCs (leucocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes). Blood groups are classified as ABO (based on antigens A and B) and Rh (based on Rh factor). Blood coagulation involves a cascade of reactions leading to fibrin clot formation. The human heart is a four-chambered organ with two atria and two ventricles. The cardiac cycle consists of atrial systole, ventricular systole, and joint diastole. The SA node (pacemaker) initiates the heartbeat. Double circulation includes pulmonary (heart to lungs and back) and systemic (heart to body and back) circuits. The ECG records electrical activity with P, QRS, and T waves.",
    "rules": [
      "The ABO blood group system has four groups (A, B, AB, O) based on the presence of antigens A and B on RBCs.",
      "The cardiac cycle lasts approximately 0.8 seconds: atrial systole (0.1s), ventricular systole (0.3s), and joint diastole (0.4s).",
      "In the ECG, the P wave represents atrial depolarisation, the QRS complex represents ventricular depolarisation, and the T wave represents ventricular repolarisation."

Option A) 25% is too low, as plasma makes up a larger portion of blood.

      "explanation_correct": "Arteries have thicker walls compared to veins because they contain more smooth muscle and elastic tissue in their tunica media. This structural adaptation allows arteries to withstand the high pressure generated by ventricular contraction as blood is pumped away from the heart. Veins, by contrast, operate under much lower pressure and have thinner walls with valves to prevent backflow.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because arteries have thicker, not thinner, walls than veins. Option C is wrong because arteries and veins differ markedly in wall thickness due to the different pressures they experience. Option D is incorrect because the thickness of a vessel wall is related to the pressure it withstands, not whether the blood is oxygenated or deoxygenated."

      "explanation_correct": "Atrial systole lasts approximately 0.1 seconds and its function is to contract the atria, pushing blood through the AV valves into the ventricles. Ventricular systole lasts approximately 0.3 seconds and involves contraction of the ventricles, pumping blood into the pulmonary trunk (from the right ventricle) and the aorta (from the left ventricle). The longer duration of ventricular systole reflects the greater force needed to push blood into the arterial circulation.",

      "explanation_correct": "The sinoatrial (SA) node is the natural pacemaker of the heart, located in the right atrium. It generates spontaneous electrical impulses at a rate of 70-75 per minute, setting the rhythm for the entire heart. When the SA node becomes dysfunctional (e.g., in sick sinus syndrome), the heart may beat too slowly or irregularly, and an artificial pacemaker is implanted to take over the function of generating rhythmic impulses to maintain a normal heart rate.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because the AV node serves as a relay station that delays the impulse briefly before passing it to the ventricles; its failure would cause a heart block, not necessarily require the same type of pacemaker replacement. Option C is wrong because the bundle of His conducts impulses down the interventricular septum. Option D is incorrect because Purkinje fibres are the terminal conducting fibres in the ventricular walls."

A common misconception is that O stands for 'both' antigens, but it actually stands for the absence of both.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is a true statement -- mature mammalian RBCs lose their nucleus during development, which provides more space for haemoglobin.

The AV node is an essential relay point in this pathway. A common student misconception is that Purkinje fibres connect directly to the SA node, but they are actually the terminal component of the conduction system, receiving impulses via the bundle branches.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is correct -- the SA node has the highest intrinsic rate of depolarisation (about 70-75 impulses/min) among all cardiac conduction tissues, making it the primary pacemaker. Option B is correct because the AV nodal delay (~0.1 s) ensures atrial contraction is complete before the ventricles contract.

The right ventricle only needs to pump deoxygenated blood to the nearby lungs through the shorter, lower-resistance pulmonary circuit. This difference in workload necessitates a thicker, more muscular left ventricular wall.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because both ventricles receive approximately the same volume of blood per beat. Option C is wrong because the ventricles do not produce oxygenated or deoxygenated blood; they pump the blood they receive.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "During the first pregnancy, an Rh-negative mother is exposed to Rh-positive foetal blood mainly during delivery (or late pregnancy), when small amounts of foetal blood may cross the placenta. This triggers the mother's immune system to begin producing anti-Rh antibodies (IgM initially, then IgG). However, the first exposure produces a relatively slow primary immune response, so significant levels of IgG anti-Rh antibodies are not built up in time to cause damage to the first foetus. In subsequent pregnancies with an Rh-positive foetus, the secondary (anamnestic) immune response is rapid and produces high levels of IgG antibodies that can cross the placenta and attack foetal RBCs.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because small amounts of foetal blood can enter the maternal circulation, especially during delivery; the placenta is not a perfect barrier. Option C is wrong because the Rh status of the foetus depends on the father's genotype and can be Rh-positive in the first pregnancy. Option D is incorrect because the maternal immune system is not completely suppressed during pregnancy -- it can still mount immune responses."

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Veins carry blood back to the heart under low pressure. Especially in the limbs, venous blood must flow against gravity, making it susceptible to backflow. Semilunar (pocket) valves at intervals along veins prevent this retrograde flow, ensuring unidirectional movement of blood towards the heart. Arteries, on the other hand, receive blood directly from the powerful contractions of the ventricles, so the sustained high arterial pressure is sufficient to maintain forward flow without the need for internal valves.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because the presence of valves is related to blood pressure, not oxygen content -- and veins carry both oxygenated (pulmonary veins) and deoxygenated blood. Option C is wrong because veins are not necessarily closer to the heart; many veins (such as those in the legs) are far from it. Option D is partially misleading -- while semilunar valves exist at the base of the aorta and pulmonary trunk, these are at the heart-artery junction, and the reason arteries lack internal valves is the high pressure, not the presence of those junctional valves."
