    "text": "Body fluids include blood and lymph. Blood consists of plasma (55%) and formed elements (45%): RBCs (erythrocytes), WBCs (leucocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes). Blood groups are classified as ABO (based on antigens A and B) and Rh (based on Rh factor). Blood coagulation involves a cascade of reactions leading to fibrin clot formation. The human heart is a four-chambered organ with two atria and two ventricles. The cardiac cycle consists of atrial systole, ventricular systole, and joint diastole. The SA node (pacemaker) initiates the heartbeat. Double circulation includes pulmonary (heart to lungs and back) and systemic (heart to body and back) circuits. The ECG records electrical activity with P, QRS, and T waves.",
    "rules": [
      "The ABO blood group system has four groups (A, B, AB, O) based on the presence of antigens A and B on RBCs.",
      "The cardiac cycle lasts approximately 0.8 seconds: atrial systole (0.1s), ventricular systole (0.3s), and joint diastole (0.4s).",
      "In the ECG, the P wave represents atrial depolarisation, the QRS complex represents ventricular depolarisation, and the T wave represents ventricular repolarisation."

Option A) 25% is too low, as plasma makes up a larger portion of blood.

      "explanation_correct": "The lifespan of a mature human red blood cell (RBC) is approximately 120 days. This is because RBCs are produced in the bone marrow and circulate in the bloodstream until they are broken down and removed by the spleen, liver, and bone marrow after about 120 days.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The lifespan of a mature human RBC is not 7 days, 365 days, or 30 days. RBCs have a lifespan of around 120 days before they are removed from circulation. This is because RBCs are continuously produced in the bone marrow and have a finite lifetime before they are broken down and replaced by new cells."

It actually involves three main phases: atrial systole, ventricular systole, and joint diastole. The total duration of the cardiac cycle is around 0.8 seconds, not just a single systole and diastole.
