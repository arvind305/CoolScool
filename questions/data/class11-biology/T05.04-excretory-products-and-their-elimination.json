    "text": "The human excretory system consists of a pair of kidneys, ureters, urinary bladder, and urethra. Each kidney contains about one million nephrons, the functional units of the kidney. Nephrons are of two types: cortical and juxtamedullary. Urine formation involves three main processes: glomerular filtration (ultrafiltration in Bowman's capsule), tubular reabsorption (selective reabsorption in PCT, loop of Henle, and DCT), and tubular secretion (active secretion of ions and urea in DCT and collecting duct). The counter-current mechanism in the loop of Henle and vasa recta helps concentrate urine. Kidney function is regulated by ADH (antidiuretic hormone) from the posterior pituitary, which increases water reabsorption, and aldosterone from the adrenal cortex, which promotes sodium reabsorption. The juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) regulates GFR through the renin-angiotensin mechanism. Common disorders include uraemia, renal failure, renal calculi, and nephritis. Dialysis and kidney transplant are treatments for renal failure.",
    "rules": [
      "The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in a healthy adult is approximately 125 mL/min or about 180 litres per day, of which 99% is reabsorbed.",
      "The counter-current mechanism operates between the loop of Henle and vasa recta, maintaining an osmotic gradient in the renal medulla for urine concentration.",
      "ADH (vasopressin) increases the permeability of the collecting duct to water, promoting water reabsorption and producing concentrated urine."

Each kidney contains about one million nephrons, which are the basic structural and functional units that carry out these vital kidney functions.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The ureter, glomerulus, and renal pelvis are not the functional units of the kidney. The ureter is a tube that transports urine from the kidney to the bladder, the glomerulus is a capillary network within the nephron where filtration occurs, and the renal pelvis is the funnel-shaped part of the kidney that collects the urine before it enters the ureter. The functional unit of the kidney is the nephron, which performs the essential tasks of filtration, reabsorption, and secretion to form urine."

The process of ultrafiltration occurs in the glomerulus, where blood pressure forces water, small molecules, and waste products to pass through the capillary walls and into the Bowman's capsule, the first part of the nephron.

This is an important part of the kidney's function to retain essential nutrients, water, and other substances while eliminating waste products.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is a number, and the correct answer is 99%. This is because the nephrons in the human kidney reabsorb around 99% of the glomerular filtrate back into the bloodstream during urine formation. Only about 1% of the initial filtrate ends up as the final urine that is excreted from the body.
