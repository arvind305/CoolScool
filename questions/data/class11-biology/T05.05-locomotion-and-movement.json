    "text": "Movement is one of the significant features of living organisms. Three types of movement occur at the cellular level: amoeboid (by pseudopodia), ciliary (by cilia), and muscular (by muscles). The human skeletal system consists of the axial skeleton (skull, vertebral column, ribs, sternum) with 80 bones, and the appendicular skeleton (limb bones and girdles) with 126 bones, totalling 206 bones. Joints are classified as fibrous (immovable), cartilaginous (slightly movable), and synovial (freely movable). Skeletal muscles are composed of muscle fibres containing myofibrils made of sarcomeres, the functional units of contraction. Each sarcomere contains actin (thin filaments) and myosin (thick filaments). Muscle contraction occurs by the sliding filament mechanism: calcium ions released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum bind to troponin, exposing active sites on actin; myosin heads form cross-bridges with actin and pull the thin filaments towards the centre of the sarcomere, shortening it. Disorders include myasthenia gravis, muscular dystrophy, tetany, arthritis, osteoporosis, and gout.",
    "rules": [
      "The sarcomere, bounded by Z-lines, is the functional unit of muscle contraction; during contraction, the I-band and H-zone shorten while the A-band remains constant.",
      "The sliding filament theory states that muscle contraction occurs by the sliding of thin (actin) filaments over thick (myosin) filaments using energy from ATP hydrolysis.",
      "The human skeleton has 206 bones: 80 in the axial skeleton (skull, vertebral column, ribs, sternum) and 126 in the appendicular skeleton (limbs and girdles)."

The sarcomere, which is the functional unit of a muscle fibre, contains two main types of filaments - the thin actin filaments and the thick myosin filaments.
