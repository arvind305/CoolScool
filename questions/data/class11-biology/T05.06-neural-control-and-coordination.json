    "text": "The neural system coordinates and integrates body functions through electrical impulses. The basic unit of the neural system is the neuron, which has a cell body (soma), dendrites (receiving impulses), and an axon (transmitting impulses). Neurons can be myelinated or non-myelinated. Nerve impulse conduction involves the generation of an action potential: at rest, the neuron is polarised (resting potential of about -70 mV); upon stimulation, sodium ions rush in causing depolarisation, followed by repolarisation as potassium ions flow out. Impulses travel along myelinated axons via saltatory conduction. Synaptic transmission occurs when neurotransmitters (e.g., acetylcholine) are released from the presynaptic terminal into the synaptic cleft and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. The central nervous system (CNS) includes the brain and spinal cord. The brain has three major parts: the forebrain (cerebrum, thalamus, hypothalamus), midbrain, and hindbrain (pons, cerebellum, medulla oblongata). A reflex arc is the neural pathway for a reflex action, involving a receptor, sensory neuron, integration centre, motor neuron, and effector. The eye and ear are important sensory organs for vision and hearing/balance respectively.",
    "rules": [
      "The resting potential of a neuron is approximately -70 mV; during an action potential, depolarisation occurs as Na+ rushes in, and repolarisation occurs as K+ flows out.",
      "A reflex arc consists of five components: receptor, sensory (afferent) neuron, integration centre (CNS), motor (efferent) neuron, and effector.",
      "The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain and is responsible for higher functions such as thinking, memory, reasoning, and voluntary actions."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format for this fill-in-the-blank question is 'blind spot'. This is the correct answer because the optic nerve exits the eye at a specific point on the retina, and this region lacks photoreceptor cells. Therefore, it appears as a blind spot in our vision.
