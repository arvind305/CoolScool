    "text": "The neural system coordinates and integrates body functions through electrical impulses. The basic unit of the neural system is the neuron, which has a cell body (soma), dendrites (receiving impulses), and an axon (transmitting impulses). Neurons can be myelinated or non-myelinated. Nerve impulse conduction involves the generation of an action potential: at rest, the neuron is polarised (resting potential of about -70 mV); upon stimulation, sodium ions rush in causing depolarisation, followed by repolarisation as potassium ions flow out. Impulses travel along myelinated axons via saltatory conduction. Synaptic transmission occurs when neurotransmitters (e.g., acetylcholine) are released from the presynaptic terminal into the synaptic cleft and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. The central nervous system (CNS) includes the brain and spinal cord. The brain has three major parts: the forebrain (cerebrum, thalamus, hypothalamus), midbrain, and hindbrain (pons, cerebellum, medulla oblongata). A reflex arc is the neural pathway for a reflex action, involving a receptor, sensory neuron, integration centre, motor neuron, and effector. The eye and ear are important sensory organs for vision and hearing/balance respectively.",
    "rules": [
      "The resting potential of a neuron is approximately -70 mV; during an action potential, depolarisation occurs as Na+ rushes in, and repolarisation occurs as K+ flows out.",
      "A reflex arc consists of five components: receptor, sensory (afferent) neuron, integration centre (CNS), motor (efferent) neuron, and effector.",
      "The cerebrum is the largest part of the human brain and is responsible for higher functions such as thinking, memory, reasoning, and voluntary actions."

      "explanation_correct": "Saltatory conduction in myelinated fibres is much faster (up to 120 m/s) than continuous conduction in non-myelinated fibres (about 0.5-2 m/s). In saltatory conduction, the action potential 'jumps' between nodes of Ranvier, where voltage-gated channels are concentrated, bypassing the myelinated segments. This greatly increases the speed and efficiency of impulse transmission.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Saltatory conduction is not slower; it is significantly faster than continuous conduction. The myelin sheath acts as an insulator that forces the impulse to jump between nodes, which paradoxically makes transmission faster, not slower."

        {"id": "A", "text": "Because reflex actions use thicker neurons"},
        {"id": "B", "text": "Because reflex arcs are mediated through the spinal cord with a shorter neural pathway, bypassing the brain's complex processing centres, allowing a rapid automatic response"},
        {"id": "C", "text": "Because reflex actions do not involve any neurons"},
        {"id": "D", "text": "Because voluntary responses use non-myelinated neurons while reflexes use myelinated neurons"}
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Reflex actions are faster because the reflex arc has a short neural pathway that is processed at the level of the spinal cord (or brainstem), without needing to send signals to the cerebral cortex for conscious processing and decision-making. The fewer synapses and shorter pathway in a reflex arc result in a much faster response time, which is essential for protective responses.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Reflex actions do involve neurons (sensory, interneurons, motor). The speed advantage is not about neuron thickness or myelination differences. The key reason is the shorter, more direct neural pathway through the spinal cord rather than the longer route to the brain for conscious processing."

        {"id": "A", "text": "Because it contains the highest density of rod cells for maximum light sensitivity"},
        {"id": "B", "text": "Because it has the highest concentration of cone cells with a one-to-one ratio with ganglion cells, providing maximum visual acuity"},
        {"id": "C", "text": "Because it is where the optic nerve exits the eye"},
        {"id": "D", "text": "Because it has the thickest layer of retinal neurons blocking light"}
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "The fovea centralis has the highest concentration of cone cells and, crucially, each cone in the fovea connects to a single ganglion cell (one-to-one ratio). This means each cone's signal is transmitted individually to the brain, providing the finest spatial resolution and sharpest visual acuity. Additionally, overlying retinal layers are displaced at the fovea, allowing light to reach cones directly.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The fovea contains mostly cones, not rods. The optic nerve exit point is the blind spot, not the fovea. The retinal layers are actually thinner (displaced) at the fovea, not thicker. The sharpest vision comes from the high cone density and one-to-one cone-to-ganglion cell connectivity."
