    "text": "The endocrine system consists of ductless glands that secrete hormones directly into the blood. The major endocrine glands include the hypothalamus (releasing and inhibiting hormones), pituitary (anterior: GH, TSH, ACTH, FSH, LH, prolactin; posterior: ADH, oxytocin), thyroid (T3, T4, calcitonin), parathyroid (PTH), adrenal (cortex: mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, sex hormones; medulla: adrenaline, noradrenaline), pancreas (insulin from beta cells, glucagon from alpha cells), and gonads (testes: testosterone; ovaries: oestrogen, progesterone). Hormones act through two mechanisms: peptide hormones bind to membrane receptors and activate second messengers (e.g., cAMP), while steroid hormones enter the cell and bind to intracellular receptors to directly affect gene expression. Hormonal secretion is regulated by feedback mechanisms (mostly negative feedback). Disorders result from hyposecretion or hypersecretion: dwarfism (low GH in childhood), acromegaly (excess GH in adults), goitre (iodine deficiency/thyroid dysfunction), diabetes mellitus (insulin deficiency/resistance), Addison's disease (low adrenal cortex hormones), and Cushing's syndrome (excess cortisol).",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is that endocrine glands secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream without ducts. This is because endocrine glands are ductless - they do not have tubes or ducts that carry their secretions to the outside of the body. Instead, the hormones are released straight into the blood circulation to reach their target tissues."

This central role in coordinating the endocrine system is why the pituitary is known as the 'master gland'.",
