    "text": "The endocrine system consists of ductless glands that secrete hormones directly into the blood. The major endocrine glands include the hypothalamus (releasing and inhibiting hormones), pituitary (anterior: GH, TSH, ACTH, FSH, LH, prolactin; posterior: ADH, oxytocin), thyroid (T3, T4, calcitonin), parathyroid (PTH), adrenal (cortex: mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, sex hormones; medulla: adrenaline, noradrenaline), pancreas (insulin from beta cells, glucagon from alpha cells), and gonads (testes: testosterone; ovaries: oestrogen, progesterone). Hormones act through two mechanisms: peptide hormones bind to membrane receptors and activate second messengers (e.g., cAMP), while steroid hormones enter the cell and bind to intracellular receptors to directly affect gene expression. Hormonal secretion is regulated by feedback mechanisms (mostly negative feedback). Disorders result from hyposecretion or hypersecretion: dwarfism (low GH in childhood), acromegaly (excess GH in adults), goitre (iodine deficiency/thyroid dysfunction), diabetes mellitus (insulin deficiency/resistance), Addison's disease (low adrenal cortex hormones), and Cushing's syndrome (excess cortisol).",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is that endocrine glands secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream without ducts. This is because endocrine glands are ductless - they do not have tubes or ducts that carry their secretions to the outside of the body. Instead, the hormones are released straight into the blood circulation to reach their target tissues."

      "explanation_correct": "Meera's visible neck swelling in the context of living in a mountainous region with limited iodine-rich foods indicates goitre caused by iodine deficiency. The thyroid gland requires iodine to synthesize thyroid hormones (T3 and T4). When dietary iodine is insufficient, the thyroid gland enlarges in a compensatory attempt to produce adequate hormones, resulting in a visible goitre. This condition is endemic in certain geographical regions, particularly mountainous areas far from the sea where soil and water have low iodine content.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Diabetes mellitus (option A) affects blood glucose regulation, not thyroid size. Acromegaly (option C) results from excess growth hormone in adults, causing enlarged extremities, not neck swelling. Cushing's syndrome (option D) causes moon face and truncal obesity from excess cortisol, not thyroid enlargement. The geographical context and neck swelling specifically indicate iodine deficiency goitre."

      "explanation_correct": "Adrenaline (epinephrine) is secreted by the adrenal medulla, not the adrenal cortex. This is a common misconception because both are parts of the adrenal gland. The adrenal gland has two functionally distinct regions: the outer cortex produces steroid hormones including glucocorticoids (cortisol), mineralocorticoids (aldosterone), and androgens (sex hormones). The inner medulla, which is essentially modified neural tissue, produces catecholamines—adrenaline and noradrenaline—in response to sympathetic nervous system stimulation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Cortisol (option A), aldosterone (option B), and androgens (option D) are all steroid hormones produced by different zones of the adrenal cortex. Students often mistakenly think all adrenal hormones come from the same part, but the adrenal medulla specifically produces adrenaline and noradrenaline, while the cortex produces the steroid hormones."

The thymus produces thymosin and is crucial for T-lymphocyte development and immune system maturation during early life. By adulthood, the thymus is largely replaced by adipose and connective tissue, though some residual function remains. In contrast, the thyroid, adrenal glands, and pancreas maintain active endocrine function throughout adult life.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Students often think all endocrine glands function equally throughout life. The thyroid gland (option A) continues producing thyroid hormones for metabolism regulation. The adrenal glands (option B) continuously produce cortisol, aldosterone, and adrenaline. The pancreas (option D) maintains insulin and glucagon production. Only the thymus undergoes significant involution after puberty, making it the exception."

This is a common misconception because students may confuse hyperthyroidism with hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease) results from excess thyroid hormones, which increase metabolic rate, cause weight loss despite increased appetite, lead to exophthalmos (protruding eyes), cause heat intolerance, nervousness, tremors, and tachycardia. Bradycardia is actually a symptom of hypothyroidism, where reduced thyroid hormones slow metabolism and heart rate.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Weight loss (option A), exophthalmos (option B), and increased metabolic rate (option D) are all characteristic features of hyperthyroidism caused by excess thyroid hormones. Students sometimes think thyroid disorders cause uniform symptoms, but hyperthyroidism accelerates body processes (including heart rate), while hypothyroidism slows them down. Bradycardia occurs in hypothyroidism, not hyperthyroidism."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "The hypothalamus is classified as the neuroendocrine link because it integrates both neural and endocrine functions. As part of the brain (nervous system), it receives neural inputs from various parts of the body about temperature, osmolarity, stress, and other conditions. In response to these neural signals, its neurosecretory cells produce and secrete hormones—both releasing hormones (like TRH, CRH, GnRH) and inhibiting hormones (like somatostatin)—that control anterior pituitary secretions. It also produces ADH and oxytocin (released via posterior pituitary). This dual function makes it the critical interface between neural and hormonal regulation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because the hypothalamus does produce hormones, not just neural signals. Option C is wrong because brain location doesn't prevent hormone secretion—the hypothalamus actively secretes hormones. Option D is incorrect because the hypothalamus produces peptide hormones (releasing/inhibiting factors, ADH, oxytocin), not steroid hormones. Only option B correctly explains its neuroendocrine bridge function."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Negative feedback regulation is essential because it maintains hormone concentrations within narrow, optimal physiological ranges necessary for health. When hormone levels rise sufficiently to achieve the desired effect, the elevated hormone (or its downstream products) signals back to inhibit further secretion by the gland or its controlling factors. Without negative feedback, hormones would accumulate to pathological levels, causing disorders like hyperthyroidism, Cushing's syndrome, or acromegaly. This self-regulating mechanism ensures dynamic equilibrium—hormones are secreted when needed and suppressed when adequate, maintaining homeostasis.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A, while energy conservation may occur, is not the primary reason for feedback regulation. Option C is incorrect because feedback controls hormone levels, not their speed of action. Option D is wrong because glands can function without feedback, but the lack of regulation would lead to dangerous hormone imbalances. Option B correctly identifies the critical homeostatic function of preventing pathological hormone accumulation."

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Growth hormone deficiency affects height only during childhood because longitudinal bone growth occurs at the epiphyseal plates (growth plates) at the ends of long bones. These cartilaginous plates allow bones to lengthen during childhood and adolescence in response to growth hormone. After puberty, rising sex hormone levels cause the epiphyseal plates to ossify (harden into bone) and close permanently. Once closed, no further longitudinal growth can occur regardless of growth hormone levels. In adults, GH deficiency causes metabolic effects (reduced muscle mass, increased fat) but cannot affect height because the growth plates are fused.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because adults do produce growth hormone, though at lower levels. Option C is wrong because growth hormone functions in adults for metabolism and tissue maintenance. Option D is incorrect because hormones aren't stored long-term; they're produced as needed. Only option B correctly explains the anatomical basis—closed epiphyseal plates prevent further height increase in adults."
