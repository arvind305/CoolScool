    "text": "Chemistry begins with understanding the fundamental laws governing chemical combination: the law of conservation of mass, law of definite proportions, and law of multiple proportions. Dalton's atomic theory provides the foundation for these laws. The mole concept relates the macroscopic world to the atomic world through Avogadro's number (6.022 × 10²³). Molar mass, percentage composition, empirical and molecular formulae, and stoichiometric calculations form the quantitative backbone of chemistry. Concentration terms such as molarity, molality, mole fraction, and parts per million allow precise description of solutions. Limiting reagent analysis determines the theoretical yield of reactions.",
    "rules": [
      "The law of conservation of mass states that mass is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction.",
      "One mole of any substance contains exactly 6.022 × 10²³ particles (Avogadro's number).",
      "The empirical formula gives the simplest whole-number ratio of atoms; the molecular formula gives the actual number of atoms in one molecule.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The law of definite proportions was not proposed by Dalton, Lavoisier, or Avogadro. Dalton proposed the atomic theory, Lavoisier made significant contributions to the understanding of combustion and the law of conservation of mass, and Avogadro developed the concept of Avogadro's number, which relates the mole to the number of particles in a substance. However, the law of definite proportions was specifically proposed by Joseph Proust."
