    "text": "Chemistry begins with understanding the fundamental laws governing chemical combination: the law of conservation of mass, law of definite proportions, and law of multiple proportions. Dalton's atomic theory provides the foundation for these laws. The mole concept relates the macroscopic world to the atomic world through Avogadro's number (6.022 × 10²³). Molar mass, percentage composition, empirical and molecular formulae, and stoichiometric calculations form the quantitative backbone of chemistry. Concentration terms such as molarity, molality, mole fraction, and parts per million allow precise description of solutions. Limiting reagent analysis determines the theoretical yield of reactions.",
    "rules": [
      "The law of conservation of mass states that mass is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction.",
      "One mole of any substance contains exactly 6.022 × 10²³ particles (Avogadro's number).",
      "The empirical formula gives the simplest whole-number ratio of atoms; the molecular formula gives the actual number of atoms in one molecule.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The law of definite proportions was not proposed by Dalton, Lavoisier, or Avogadro. Dalton proposed the atomic theory, Lavoisier made significant contributions to the understanding of combustion and the law of conservation of mass, and Avogadro developed the concept of Avogadro's number, which relates the mole to the number of particles in a substance. However, the law of definite proportions was specifically proposed by Joseph Proust."

      "correct_answer": "N₂O₄",
      "explanation_correct": "The molecular formula of a compound is the simplest whole number ratio of its constituent atoms. Given the empirical formula NO₂ and the molar mass of 92 g/mol, the molecular formula must be N₂O₄ to account for the higher molar mass.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be N₂O₂. While this would have the same empirical formula as NO₂, it does not match the given molar mass of 92 g/mol. The correct molecular formula N₂O₄ has a molar mass of 92 g/mol, which satisfies the information provided in the question."

      "correct_answer": "55.5",
      "explanation_correct": "The molarity of pure water is approximately 55.5 M because the density of water is 1 g/mL and the molar mass of water is 18 g/mol. Molarity is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution, so for pure water, the molarity is the number of moles of water per liter of solution, which is around 55.5 mol/L.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format for this question is a single decimal value, which should be 55.5 M. The incorrect answer might be due to a mistake in the calculation or a misunderstanding of the concept of molarity. Molarity is defined as the number of moles of solute per liter of solution, and for pure water, the molarity is determined by the density and molar mass of water."

      "correct_answer": "1.12",
      "explanation_correct": "The volume of H₂ gas evolved at STP is 1.12 L because the balanced chemical equation shows that 2 moles of Na react with 2 moles of H₂O to produce 1 mole of H₂ gas. Using the molar mass of Na (23 g/mol) and the given amount of 2.3 g, we can calculate the number of moles of Na (2.3 g / 23 g/mol = 0.1 mol) and use Avogadro's number to find the volume of H₂ (0.1 mol × 22.4 L/mol = 2.24 L).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be 2.24 L. This is because the student may have incorrectly assumed that the 2 moles of Na would produce 2 moles of H₂ gas, rather than 1 mole. The correct answer is 1.12 L, which is calculated by using the balanced chemical equation and the given mass of sodium."

      "explanation_correct": "The law of multiple proportions was proposed by John Dalton as part of his atomic theory. Dalton observed that when two elements form more than one compound, the masses of one element that combine with a fixed mass of the other element are in simple whole number ratios. This law helped explain the formation and composition of chemical compounds.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The law of multiple proportions was not proposed by Avogadro. Avogadro's contribution was the concept of Avogadro's number, which relates the macroscopic and atomic scales. The law of multiple proportions was in fact proposed by John Dalton, as part of his atomic theory, to explain the fixed ratios of elements in chemical compounds."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is 8 g CH₄, 44 g CO₂, 28 g N₂, 36 g H₂O. This is because the number of moles is inversely proportional to the molar mass of the substance. Methane (CH₄) has the lowest molar mass, so 8 g of it has the highest number of moles. Carbon dioxide (CO₂) has a higher molar mass, followed by nitrogen (N₂) and water (H₂O).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to arrange the substances based on their masses instead of the number of moles. This is wrong because the same mass of different substances can have different numbers of moles due to their varying molar masses. The correct approach is to convert the given masses to the corresponding number of moles using the molar mass of each substance, and then arrange them in increasing order of the number of moles."
