    "text": "The atom's structure evolved from Thomson's plum-pudding model through Rutherford's nuclear model to Bohr's quantized orbits for hydrogen. Modern quantum mechanics describes electrons using four quantum numbers (n, l, ml, ms) and probability-based orbitals rather than fixed paths. The shapes of s, p, and d orbitals reflect the spatial probability distribution of electrons. Electron configurations are determined by the Aufbau principle (fill lowest energy first), Pauli exclusion principle (no two electrons share all four quantum numbers), and Hund's rule (maximize unpaired electrons in degenerate orbitals). The dual nature of matter (de Broglie) and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle set fundamental limits on simultaneous measurement of position and momentum.",
