    "text": "The atom's structure evolved from Thomson's plum-pudding model through Rutherford's nuclear model to Bohr's quantized orbits for hydrogen. Modern quantum mechanics describes electrons using four quantum numbers (n, l, ml, ms) and probability-based orbitals rather than fixed paths. The shapes of s, p, and d orbitals reflect the spatial probability distribution of electrons. Electron configurations are determined by the Aufbau principle (fill lowest energy first), Pauli exclusion principle (no two electrons share all four quantum numbers), and Hund's rule (maximize unpaired electrons in degenerate orbitals). The dual nature of matter (de Broglie) and the Heisenberg uncertainty principle set fundamental limits on simultaneous measurement of position and momentum.",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p. This is because the energy levels increase as the principal quantum number (n) increases, and for the same n, the order of energy levels is s < p < d. Therefore, the 3p subshell has the lowest energy, followed by the 4s, 3d, and 4p subshells.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be 4s, 3p, 3d, 4p. This is because the energy levels are determined by the principal quantum number (n) first, and then the angular momentum quantum number (l). However, for the same n, the order of energy levels is s < p < d, not the other way around. Therefore, the correct order is 3p, 4s, 3d, 4p."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to place the quantum mechanical model before Bohr's model. The quantum mechanical model, which describes electrons as probability distributions rather than fixed orbits, was proposed later than Bohr's model, which introduced the idea of quantized electron orbits. The correct order is important to understand the historical development of our understanding of atomic structure."
