    "text": "The modern periodic table arranges elements in order of increasing atomic number, reflecting repeating (periodic) patterns in electronic configuration and chemical properties. Elements are classified into s, p, d, and f blocks based on the subshell being filled. Key periodic trends include: atomic and ionic radii decrease across a period (increasing nuclear charge) and increase down a group (additional shells); ionization enthalpy generally increases across a period and decreases down a group; electron gain enthalpy becomes more negative across a period (with exceptions); and electronegativity increases across a period and decreases down a group. Anomalous behaviours of first-row elements (Li, Be) lead to diagonal relationships (Li-Mg, Be-Al).",

      "Modern periodic law: Properties of elements are periodic functions of their atomic numbers.",
      "Atomic radius decreases across a period due to increasing effective nuclear charge and increases down a group due to addition of new shells.",
      "Ionization enthalpy increases across a period and decreases down a group; exceptions occur due to half-filled and fully-filled stability.",

      "explanation_correct": "The modern periodic law states that the properties of elements are periodic functions of their atomic number, which is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. This is because the atomic number determines the element's electronic configuration, which in turn determines its chemical properties.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The modern periodic law does not depend on the atomic mass, number of neutrons, or mass number of an element. These properties can vary for a given element (different isotopes), but the periodic trends are based on the atomic number, which is the same for all isotopes of an element. The atomic number is the key factor that determines the element's position in the periodic table and its chemical properties."
