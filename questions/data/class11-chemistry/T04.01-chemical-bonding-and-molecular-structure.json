    "text": "Chemical bonding explains how atoms combine to form molecules and compounds. Ionic bonds form by electron transfer between metals and nonmetals, while covalent bonds involve electron sharing. Lewis structures help visualize bonding and lone pairs; formal charge analysis identifies the most stable structure. VSEPR theory predicts molecular geometry based on electron-pair repulsion around the central atom. Hybridization (sp, sp², sp³, sp³d, sp³d²) explains the observed geometries through orbital mixing. Molecular orbital theory describes bonding as constructive and destructive interference of atomic orbitals, producing bonding and antibonding MOs. Bond order = (bonding electrons - antibonding electrons)/2 determines bond stability.",
    "rules": [
      "Formal charge = valence electrons - lone pair electrons - ½(bonding electrons).",
      "VSEPR: electron pairs around a central atom arrange to minimize repulsion; lone pair-lone pair > lone pair-bond pair > bond pair-bond pair repulsion.",

      "explanation_correct": "Ionic bonds form between a metal and a nonmetal. Metals have loosely held valence electrons that can be donated, while nonmetals have high electron affinity and can accept these electrons to achieve a stable full outer shell. This electron transfer creates oppositely charged ions that are attracted to each other, forming the ionic bond.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Ionic bonds do not form between two nonmetals, as neither has the ability to easily donate or accept electrons. Two metals would also not form an ionic bond, as both would have valence electrons that they would be reluctant to lose. Noble gases have a full outer shell of electrons and are extremely unreactive, so they cannot participate in ionic bonding either."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The carbon-carbon triple bond does not involve sp³ hybridization, as this would result in a tetrahedral geometry with 109.5° bond angles, which is not observed in acetylene. Similarly, sp² hybridization, with its trigonal planar geometry, would also not be able to accommodate the linear 180° bond angles of the triple bond.

      "explanation_correct": "The order of increasing bond order is O₂²⁻, O₂⁻, O₂, O₂⁺. As the number of bonding electrons increases and the number of antibonding electrons decreases, the bond order increases, making the bond stronger.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be O₂⁺, O₂, O₂⁻, O₂²⁻. This is because as the number of electrons in the molecule increases, the bond order decreases. However, the correct order considers the balance between bonding and antibonding electrons to determine the overall bond order."

      "explanation_correct": "The bond angles increase in the order H-O-H (104.5°) < H-N-H (107.8°) < H-C-H (109.5°) < F-B-F (120°). This is because the number of electron pairs around the central atom increases, from 2 in H₂O, to 3 in NH₃, to 4 in CH₄, to 3 in BF₃. More electron pairs lead to greater electron-pair repulsion, resulting in larger bond angles.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be H-O-H, H-C-H, H-N-H, F-B-F. This is wrong because the bond angle is not solely determined by the number of atoms bonded to the central atom. The VSEPR theory predicts that the bond angle depends on the number of electron pairs around the central atom, not just the number of atoms. The correct order reflects the increasing number of electron pairs, which experience greater repulsion and lead to larger bond angles."
