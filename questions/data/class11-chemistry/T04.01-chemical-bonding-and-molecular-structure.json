    "text": "Chemical bonding explains how atoms combine to form molecules and compounds. Ionic bonds form by electron transfer between metals and nonmetals, while covalent bonds involve electron sharing. Lewis structures help visualize bonding and lone pairs; formal charge analysis identifies the most stable structure. VSEPR theory predicts molecular geometry based on electron-pair repulsion around the central atom. Hybridization (sp, sp², sp³, sp³d, sp³d²) explains the observed geometries through orbital mixing. Molecular orbital theory describes bonding as constructive and destructive interference of atomic orbitals, producing bonding and antibonding MOs. Bond order = (bonding electrons - antibonding electrons)/2 determines bond stability.",
    "rules": [
      "Formal charge = valence electrons - lone pair electrons - ½(bonding electrons).",
      "VSEPR: electron pairs around a central atom arrange to minimize repulsion; lone pair-lone pair > lone pair-bond pair > bond pair-bond pair repulsion.",

      "explanation_correct": "Ionic bonds form between a metal and a nonmetal. Metals have loosely held valence electrons that can be donated, while nonmetals have high electron affinity and can accept these electrons to achieve a stable full outer shell. This electron transfer creates oppositely charged ions that are attracted to each other, forming the ionic bond.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Ionic bonds do not form between two nonmetals, as neither has the ability to easily donate or accept electrons. Two metals would also not form an ionic bond, as both would have valence electrons that they would be reluctant to lose. Noble gases have a full outer shell of electrons and are extremely unreactive, so they cannot participate in ionic bonding either."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The carbon-carbon triple bond does not involve sp³ hybridization, as this would result in a tetrahedral geometry with 109.5° bond angles, which is not observed in acetylene. Similarly, sp² hybridization, with its trigonal planar geometry, would also not be able to accommodate the linear 180° bond angles of the triple bond.

      "explanation_correct": "In benzene, each carbon atom forms 3 sigma bonds, which requires 3 hybrid orbitals. This is achieved through sp² hybridization, where one s orbital mixes with two p orbitals to form three sp² hybrid orbitals arranged in a trigonal planar geometry with 120° angles. The remaining unhybridized p orbital on each carbon is perpendicular to the ring plane and participates in the delocalized pi bonding system that gives benzene its aromatic stability.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "sp³ hybridization would form 4 sigma bonds (tetrahedral), not 3. sp hybridization would form only 2 sigma bonds (linear), not 3. sp³d hybridization involves 5 bonding regions and d orbitals, which are not used in simple organic molecules like benzene. The number of sigma bonds formed by a carbon atom determines its hybridization state."

When one electron is removed to form N₂⁺, there are 9 electrons total. The electron is removed from the highest energy orbital (σ₂p bonding orbital). The bond order calculation is (8 bonding electrons - 1 antibonding electron)/2 = Wait, let me recalculate properly: N₂ MO filling is σ1s² σ*1s² σ2s² σ*2s² π2p⁴ σ2p². Removing one electron from σ2p gives σ1s² σ*1s² σ2s² σ*2s² π2p⁴ σ2p¹. Bond order = (8 bonding - 3 antibonding)/2 = Actually, for second period: bonding orbitals have 8 electrons, antibonding have 1. No wait. Core electrons cancel. For N₂: 8 bonding, 2 antibonding in valence = BO 3. For N₂⁺: removing from σ2p → 7 bonding, 2 antibonding = (7-2)/2 = 2.5.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "N₂ has bond order 3, but when an electron is removed, the bond order decreases. Bond order 3.5 would require more bonding electrons than N₂ has. Bond order 2.0 would result from removing two electrons. The calculation must use the formula (bonding electrons - antibonding electrons)/2 with the correct electron count of 9 for N₂⁺."

The oxygen atom has 4 electron pairs (2 bonding and 2 lone pairs) arranged tetrahedrally, which would give 109.5° in ideal tetrahedral geometry. However, the two lone pairs on oxygen exert greater repulsion than bonding pairs, compressing the H-O-H bond angle from the ideal tetrahedral angle to about 104.5°. This is a classic example of lone pair repulsion affecting molecular geometry.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "109.5° is the ideal tetrahedral angle without considering lone pair effects. 120° is for trigonal planar geometry with no lone pairs. 180° is for linear geometry. The actual bond angle in water is compressed below the tetrahedral ideal due to lone pair-bonding pair repulsion being greater than bonding pair-bonding pair repulsion, as predicted by VSEPR theory."

This is a common misconception: students often confuse electron geometry with molecular geometry. While the electron geometry is tetrahedral (4 electron pairs), the molecular geometry (considering only bonded atoms) is bent because 2 of the 4 positions are occupied by lone pairs. CH₄, CF₄, and SiH₄ all have 4 bonding pairs and 0 lone pairs, giving tetrahedral molecular geometry.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Many students believe sp³ hybridization always produces tetrahedral molecular shape. However, hybridization describes electron pair arrangement (electron geometry), while molecular shape describes atom positions only.

This is a famous exception that demonstrates the power of MO theory over Lewis structures. Most students expect that a molecule with a double bond (bond order 2) should have all electrons paired, but O₂'s MO configuration shows π2p⁴ π*2p² with the two electrons in π* orbitals following Hund's rule and remaining unpaired. C₂ has bond order 2 and is diamagnetic, while F₂ has bond order 1 and N₂ has bond order 3.",

The two lone pairs occupy opposite positions (trans to each other) in the octahedral arrangement to minimize lone pair-lone pair repulsion, which is the strongest type of electron pair repulsion. This leaves the 4 fluorine atoms in the remaining four positions forming a square planar molecular geometry. The reason is the presence and positioning of lone pairs, not the bonding pairs alone.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Xenon forms various geometries depending on the number of bonding pairs, not always square planar.

To form 2 sigma bonds, carbon needs exactly 2 hybrid orbitals, which is achieved through sp hybridization (mixing one s and one p orbital). The two remaining unhybridized p orbitals on carbon are perpendicular to each other and to the molecular axis, forming two pi bonds (one pi bond with each oxygen). The number of sigma bonds determines hybridization, not the presence of double bonds per se.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Not all double bonds require sp hybridization; it depends on total sigma bonds. Ethene (C₂H₄) has a double bond but uses sp² hybridization because each carbon forms 3 sigma bonds. Electronegativity affects bond polarity, not hybridization state. While CO₂ is linear, linearity is the result of sp hybridization (2 bonding regions), not the cause.

      "explanation_incorrect": "Once formed, coordinate bonds have the same strength and properties as regular covalent bonds; the distinction is only in how the bond forms.
