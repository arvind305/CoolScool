    "text": "The gaseous state is described by gas laws: Boyle's law (P inversely proportional to V at constant T), Charles's law (V proportional to T at constant P), and Avogadro's law (V proportional to n at constant T and P). These combine into the ideal gas equation PV = nRT. Dalton's law of partial pressures and Graham's law of diffusion describe gas mixtures and movement. The kinetic molecular theory explains macroscopic gas properties through molecular motion, defining rms, average, and most probable speeds. Real gases deviate from ideal behavior at high pressure and low temperature; the van der Waals equation (P + a/V²)(V - b) = RT accounts for intermolecular forces (a) and molecular volume (b). The critical temperature marks the highest temperature at which a gas can be liquefied by pressure alone.",

This is because at the critical temperature, the gas and liquid phases become indistinguishable, and the gas cannot be liquefied no matter how much pressure is applied.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'critical' temperature. The critical temperature is the highest temperature at which a gas can be liquefied by pressure alone. If the temperature is above the critical temperature, the gas cannot be liquefied even by applying very high pressure.
