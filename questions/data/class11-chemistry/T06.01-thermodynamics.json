    "text": "Chemical thermodynamics deals with the energy changes accompanying chemical reactions and physical transformations. The first law of thermodynamics (ΔU = q + w) establishes energy conservation, where internal energy change equals heat absorbed plus work done on the system. Enthalpy (H = U + PV) is the heat exchanged at constant pressure. Hess's law states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is independent of the path taken. Standard enthalpies of formation, combustion, and bond dissociation allow calculation of reaction enthalpies. The second law introduces entropy (S) as a measure of disorder; for a spontaneous process at constant T and P, the Gibbs free energy change ΔG = ΔH - TΔS must be negative. The third law states that the entropy of a perfect crystal at 0 K is zero.",

      "question_text": "In an isothermal reversible expansion of an ideal gas, the work done by the gas is w = -nRT ln(V₂/V₁). The heat absorbed q equals ___ (in terms of w).",
      "correct_answer": "-w",
      "explanation_correct": "The work done by the gas in an isothermal reversible expansion of an ideal gas is given by the formula w = -nRT ln(V₂/V₁). Since the first law of thermodynamics states that ΔU = q + w, and for an isothermal process the internal energy change ΔU is zero, the heat absorbed q must be equal to -w.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to think that the heat absorbed q is not related to the work done w. However, this is not correct. The first law of thermodynamics states that the change in internal energy ΔU is equal to the heat absorbed q plus the work done w. Since ΔU = 0 for an isothermal process, q must be equal to -w."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is H₂O(s) < H₂O(l) < H₂O(g) < H₂(g) + ½O₂(g) because as the system goes from a more ordered (solid) to a more disordered (gas) state, the entropy increases. This is because the particles have more freedom to move around in the gas phase compared to the solid and liquid phases.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be H₂O(s) < H₂O(l) < H₂(g) + ½O₂(g) < H₂O(g). This is wrong because the entropy of the gas mixture H₂(g) + ½O₂(g) is higher than the entropy of the water vapor H₂O(g). The gas mixture has a more disordered arrangement of particles compared to the water vapor, so it has a higher entropy."

This is incorrect because an open system has the highest ability to exchange with the surroundings, as it can exchange both energy and matter.
