    "text": "Chemical thermodynamics deals with the energy changes accompanying chemical reactions and physical transformations. The first law of thermodynamics (ΔU = q + w) establishes energy conservation, where internal energy change equals heat absorbed plus work done on the system. Enthalpy (H = U + PV) is the heat exchanged at constant pressure. Hess's law states that the enthalpy change for a reaction is independent of the path taken. Standard enthalpies of formation, combustion, and bond dissociation allow calculation of reaction enthalpies. The second law introduces entropy (S) as a measure of disorder; for a spontaneous process at constant T and P, the Gibbs free energy change ΔG = ΔH - TΔS must be negative. The third law states that the entropy of a perfect crystal at 0 K is zero.",

The conversion requires breaking and reforming many C-C bonds, which involves an extremely high activation energy barrier. At room temperature, virtually no carbon atoms have enough energy to overcome this barrier, so the rate is negligibly slow despite being thermodynamically favourable.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "ΔG is indeed negative for this conversion, making it thermodynamically spontaneous. However, spontaneity does not imply speed. The key distinction is between thermodynamic favourability and kinetic feasibility. The enormous activation energy barrier prevents the conversion at room temperature."
