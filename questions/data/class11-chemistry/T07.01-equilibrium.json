    "text": "Chemical equilibrium is a dynamic state where the rate of forward reaction equals the rate of reverse reaction, and concentrations of reactants and products remain constant. The equilibrium constant Kc (in terms of concentrations) and Kp (in terms of partial pressures) are related by Kp = Kc(RT)^Δn. Le Chatelier's principle predicts that a system at equilibrium shifts to counteract any imposed change (concentration, pressure, temperature). Ionic equilibrium covers acid-base theory (Arrhenius, Bronsted-Lowry, Lewis), pH calculations, ionization constants Ka and Kb, buffer solutions described by the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, and solubility equilibria governed by Ksp and the common ion effect.",

      "correct_answer": "14",
      "explanation_correct": "The sum of pH and pOH for any aqueous solution at 25°C is always 14. This is because the product of the concentrations of hydrogen ions (H+) and hydroxide ions (OH-) in water is constant at 1 × 10^-14 at 25°C. Therefore, the sum of the negative logarithms of these concentrations, which are pH and pOH, must always add up to 14.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is a single numeric value of 14. However, the sum of pH and pOH for an aqueous solution is not always a constant value of 14. The sum of pH and pOH depends on the concentrations of H+ and OH- ions in the solution, which can vary. At 25°C, the product of [H+] and [OH-] is 1 × 10^-14, but the individual values of pH and pOH can change depending on the acidity or basicity of the solution."

      "question_text": "Meera measured the pH of her school's swimming pool water and found it to be 8.5. She knows that the pool should be maintained between pH 7.2 and 7.8. What should be added to lower the pH to the desired range?",

        {"id": "D", "text": "Sodium chloride (NaCl) to make the water neutral"}
      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "Since the pool pH is 8.5 (too basic), acid must be added to lower the pH to the desired range (7.2-7.8). Adding HCl or another acid would neutralise excess OH⁻ ions and increase [H⁺], thereby lowering the pH. In practice, dilute HCl or sodium bisulphate is commonly used for pool pH adjustment.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Adding NaOH (a base) would increase pH further. Simply adding water would only slightly dilute and may not bring pH into the desired range. NaCl is a neutral salt and would not significantly change pH. Adding acid is the correct approach to lower pH."

      "explanation_correct": "A catalyst does NOT shift the equilibrium position. It increases both the forward and reverse reaction rates equally, helping the system reach equilibrium faster without changing the equilibrium concentrations or the value of Kc/Kp. Changing concentration, temperature, or pressure (when Δn ≠ 0) all shift the equilibrium position.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Students often mistakenly believe catalysts shift equilibrium toward products. A catalyst affects only the rate, not the position of equilibrium. Concentration changes, temperature changes, and pressure changes (for reactions with Δn ≠ 0) are all genuine equilibrium-shifting factors."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Students may think any acid-base combination forms a conjugate pair. However, conjugate pairs must differ by exactly one H⁺. NaCl and NaOH differ by replacing Cl⁻ with OH⁻, not by a proton transfer, so they are not a conjugate pair."

The common ion effect requires the added ion to be one that is produced by the dissolution of the sparingly soluble salt.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Addition of a common ion and increasing common ion concentration both decrease solubility through the common ion effect. Temperature decrease can reduce solubility for exothermically dissolving salts. Adding a non-common ion salt does not provide common ions to shift the dissolution equilibrium."

Kc is related to ΔG° by ΔG° = -RTlnKc, showing its dependence on temperature.",

When C decreases (dilution), α must increase to maintain the constant Ka value. This is Ostwald's dilution law: at infinite dilution, α approaches 1 (complete ionisation). The equilibrium shifts to produce more ions to maintain Ka.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Ka is a constant at a given temperature and does not change with dilution. Water does not catalyse ionisation. The additional water from dilution does not significantly add H⁺. The key reason is that α must increase to compensate for the decreased C in maintaining the Ka ratio."

According to Le Chatelier's principle, the dissolution equilibrium shifts to the left (toward the solid), causing precipitation of the salt until Q returns to Ksp. The net effect is a reduction in the solubility of the sparingly soluble salt because one of its ions is already present in excess.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The common ion does not chemically react with the salt or change the Ksp value (which depends only on temperature). It does not remove water molecules. The mechanism is purely equilibrium-based: the excess common ion pushes the dissolution equilibrium backward, reducing solubility."
