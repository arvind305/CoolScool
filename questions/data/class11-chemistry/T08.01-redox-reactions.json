    "text": "Redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons between species. Oxidation is loss of electrons (increase in oxidation number) and reduction is gain of electrons (decrease in oxidation number). Oxidation numbers are assigned following standard rules: free elements are 0, monoatomic ions equal their charge, oxygen is usually -2, hydrogen is usually +1. Redox equations can be balanced using the oxidation number method or the half-reaction (ion-electron) method in acidic or basic media. Types of redox reactions include combination, decomposition, displacement, and disproportionation (where the same element is simultaneously oxidized and reduced).",
    "rules": [
      "Oxidation = loss of electrons = increase in oxidation number; Reduction = gain of electrons = decrease in oxidation number.",
      "In any redox reaction, the total increase in oxidation number must equal the total decrease.",
      "Rules for oxidation numbers: free element = 0; O = -2 (except in peroxides -1); H = +1 (except in metal hydrides -1); sum of oxidation numbers in a compound = 0; in an ion = charge of the ion.",
