    "text": "Hydrogen occupies a unique position in the periodic table due to its electronic configuration (1s¹) resembling both alkali metals (ns¹) and halogens (one electron short of noble gas). It exists as three isotopes: protium (¹H), deuterium (²H or D), and tritium (³H or T). Dihydrogen (H₂) is prepared industrially and in the laboratory through various methods and is used as a fuel and reducing agent. Hydrides are classified as ionic (formed with electropositive metals), covalent (with nonmetals), and interstitial (with transition metals). Water has unique properties due to extensive hydrogen bonding, existing in hard and soft forms. Heavy water (D₂O) has higher boiling point and density than ordinary water. Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) is a powerful oxidizing agent with a non-planar open-book structure.",

      "Hydrogen has three isotopes: protium (mass 1), deuterium (mass 2), and tritium (mass 3, radioactive).",
      "Hydrides are ionic (NaH, CaH₂), covalent (H₂O, NH₃, CH₄), or interstitial (TiH, PdH).",
      "Water has anomalous properties: high boiling point, high specific heat, maximum density at 4°C, all due to hydrogen bonding.",
      "H₂O₂ acts as both an oxidizing and reducing agent; its structure is non-planar with an O-O bond."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct bond angle in the water molecule is approximately 104.5°, not 90°, 109.5°, or 120°. The 104.5° bond angle is due to the tetrahedral arrangement of the two bonding pairs and two lone pairs of electrons around the central oxygen atom. The 90° option is incorrect because it does not match the actual bond angle, while 109.5° and 120° are the bond angles of other molecular geometries, such as those of methane (CH4) and benzene (C6H6), respectively, which do not apply to the water molecule."

In fact, hydrogen is a very light gas, with a much lower density than other fuels like kerosene. The green color when burned is also not a relevant property for its use as a rocket fuel. The key reason is its high calorific value per unit mass, which provides the necessary energy to propel rockets and spacecraft."

The higher bond strength of H-H makes it more stable and requires more energy to break compared to the F-F bond.",

This is because fluorine is a highly electronegative element, and the F-F bond requires less energy to break compared to the strong covalent bond in hydrogen.

The dihedral angle in the non-planar structure of hydrogen peroxide is not 90 degrees or 180 degrees, as those would correspond to a planar structure.

This is because the 1s electron in hydrogen is held very tightly by the nucleus with no inner-shell shielding, whereas alkali metals have inner electron shells that shield the outermost electron from the nuclear charge.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Hydrogen does not have a lower or identical ionization enthalpy compared to alkali metals. Despite sharing the ns¹ configuration, hydrogen's single electron experiences no shielding from inner shells and is held much more tightly by the nucleus. This is precisely why hydrogen does not exhibit the typical metallic character of alkali metals under ordinary conditions."

Although hydrogen resembles halogens in needing one electron to complete its shell, halogens have much stronger electron-attracting tendencies due to their higher nuclear charges and smaller atomic radii.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Hydrogen is not more electronegative than halogens, nor does it match fluorine's electronegativity. While hydrogen shares the property of needing one electron to achieve a stable configuration (like halogens), its electronegativity value of 2.1 is lower than even iodine (2.5), the least electronegative halogen.

      "explanation_correct": "H₂O reaches maximum density at 4°C, whereas D₂O reaches maximum density at 11.6°C. The higher temperature for D₂O is because the heavier deuterium atoms result in stronger hydrogen bonds (due to lower zero-point vibrational energy), requiring more thermal energy to overcome the open hydrogen-bonded network that makes the liquid less dense.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The temperature of maximum density is different for H₂O and D₂O. They do not share the same temperature of maximum density at 4°C.

Covalent hydrides like H₂O and NH₃ consist of neutral molecules held by intermolecular forces and lack free ions, so they do not conduct electricity in the molten state.",

      "explanation_correct": "In the gaseous phase, the dihedral angle of H₂O₂ is approximately 111.5°, but in the solid crystalline phase, it decreases to approximately 90°. This change occurs because of extensive intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the crystal lattice, which constrains the molecule and forces the dihedral angle to a smaller value.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The dihedral angle of H₂O₂ is not the same in both phases and does not increase in the solid phase. In the gaseous phase, the molecule has a dihedral angle of about 111.5° due to repulsion between lone pairs. In the solid phase, intermolecular hydrogen bonding in the crystal lattice compresses the dihedral angle to about 90°. The molecule does not become planar in any condensed phase."

Permanent hardness cannot be removed by boiling.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Permanent hardness is caused by chlorides and sulphates of Ca and Mg, which do not decompose on boiling and therefore cannot be removed this way.

The evidence is: (1) unboiled water does not lather with soap (hard water), (2) boiling removes the hardness and produces lather, and (3) a white residue (CaCO₃) forms inside the kettle. On heating, Ca(HCO₃)₂ decomposes: Ca(HCO₃)₂ → CaCO₃↓ + H₂O + CO₂↑. The insoluble CaCO₃ is the white residue.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "CaSO₄ and MgCl₂ cause permanent hardness, which cannot be removed by boiling. If these were present, the water would still not lather after boiling. NaCl does not cause water hardness at all. Only Ca(HCO₃)₂ explains all three observations: hard water before boiling, soft water after boiling, and white CaCO₃ residue in the kettle."

      "explanation_correct": "H₂O₂ undergoes decomposition when exposed to light and heat: 2H₂O₂ → 2H₂O + O₂↑. The bubbles Amit observed were oxygen gas being released, and the decrease in volume is because the H₂O₂ decomposed into water (which partly evaporated) and oxygen gas. This is why H₂O₂ is stored in dark-coloured bottles away from sunlight and in wax-lined or plastic containers to minimise catalytic decomposition.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "H₂O₂ does not simply evaporate like water; its decomposition is a chemical reaction producing O₂ gas (the bubbles). H₂O₂ does not react with atmospheric nitrogen under these conditions, nor does it polymerise. The correct explanation is photocatalytic decomposition of H₂O₂ into water and oxygen, which is why proper storage conditions (dark, cool, smooth-surfaced containers) are essential."

      "explanation_incorrect": "In options A, B, and D, H₂O₂ acts as an oxidising agent — it oxidises I⁻ to I₂, S²⁻ to SO₄²⁻, and Fe²⁺ to Fe³⁺ respectively, while itself being reduced. Only in option C, when reacting with the powerful oxidising agent KMnO₄, does H₂O₂ switch roles and act as a reducing agent, getting oxidised to O₂.

Each water molecule can form up to four hydrogen bonds, creating a robust network. H₂S cannot form hydrogen bonds because sulphur is not electronegative enough (2.5) and is too large, so H₂S molecules are held together only by weaker van der Waals forces.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option B is incorrect — the O-H bond is actually shorter than the S-H bond, not longer. Option C is wrong because H₂O (18 g/mol) is lighter than H₂S (34 g/mol), not heavier. Option D is incorrect because water has a bent geometry (bond angle 104.5°), not linear.

A structure with 2 BH₃ units sharing all bonds normally would require 14 electrons.

B₂H₆ does not have surplus electrons — it has fewer electrons than needed for conventional bonding. The boron atoms do not carry a permanent negative charge.
