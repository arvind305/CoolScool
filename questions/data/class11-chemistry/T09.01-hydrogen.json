    "text": "Hydrogen occupies a unique position in the periodic table due to its electronic configuration (1s¹) resembling both alkali metals (ns¹) and halogens (one electron short of noble gas). It exists as three isotopes: protium (¹H), deuterium (²H or D), and tritium (³H or T). Dihydrogen (H₂) is prepared industrially and in the laboratory through various methods and is used as a fuel and reducing agent. Hydrides are classified as ionic (formed with electropositive metals), covalent (with nonmetals), and interstitial (with transition metals). Water has unique properties due to extensive hydrogen bonding, existing in hard and soft forms. Heavy water (D₂O) has higher boiling point and density than ordinary water. Hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) is a powerful oxidizing agent with a non-planar open-book structure.",

      "Hydrogen has three isotopes: protium (mass 1), deuterium (mass 2), and tritium (mass 3, radioactive).",
      "Hydrides are ionic (NaH, CaH₂), covalent (H₂O, NH₃, CH₄), or interstitial (TiH, PdH).",
      "Water has anomalous properties: high boiling point, high specific heat, maximum density at 4°C, all due to hydrogen bonding.",
      "H₂O₂ acts as both an oxidizing and reducing agent; its structure is non-planar with an O-O bond."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct bond angle in the water molecule is approximately 104.5°, not 90°, 109.5°, or 120°. The 104.5° bond angle is due to the tetrahedral arrangement of the two bonding pairs and two lone pairs of electrons around the central oxygen atom. The 90° option is incorrect because it does not match the actual bond angle, while 109.5° and 120° are the bond angles of other molecular geometries, such as those of methane (CH4) and benzene (C6H6), respectively, which do not apply to the water molecule."

In fact, hydrogen is a very light gas, with a much lower density than other fuels like kerosene. The green color when burned is also not a relevant property for its use as a rocket fuel. The key reason is its high calorific value per unit mass, which provides the necessary energy to propel rockets and spacecraft."

The dihedral angle in the non-planar structure of hydrogen peroxide is not 90 degrees or 180 degrees, as those would correspond to a planar structure.

Clark's method and adding washing soda are also effective, but less so than boiling. Ion exchange is the least effective of the given methods for removing temporary hardness.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct order of effectiveness for removing temporary hardness is: Boiling, Clark's method, Adding washing soda, Ion exchange. Boiling is the most effective as it causes the dissolved minerals to precipitate out. Clark's method and adding washing soda are also effective, but less so than boiling. Ion exchange is the least effective as it does not actually remove the dissolved minerals, but rather exchanges them for other ions."
