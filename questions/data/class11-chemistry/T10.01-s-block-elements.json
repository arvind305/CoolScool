    "text": "The s-block elements comprise Group 1 (alkali metals: Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Fr) and Group 2 (alkaline earth metals: Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Ra). They have ns¹ and ns² configurations respectively. Alkali metals are the most reactive metals: soft, low melting, and form strongly basic hydroxides. Alkaline earth metals are harder, have higher melting points, and show +2 oxidation state. Both groups show regular trends in properties down the group. Lithium and beryllium show anomalous behavior due to small size and high charge density, leading to diagonal relationships (Li-Mg, Be-Al). Important compounds include NaOH (caustic soda), Na₂CO₃ (washing soda), NaHCO₃ (baking soda), CaO (quicklime), Ca(OH)₂ (slaked lime), and CaSO₄·½H₂O (Plaster of Paris).",
    "rules": [
      "Alkali metals have the lowest ionization enthalpies in their respective periods and are the strongest reducing agents.",
      "Down Group 1 and 2: atomic radius increases, ionization enthalpy decreases, reactivity increases.",
      "Lithium shows diagonal relationship with magnesium: both form nitrides, covalent organometallic compounds, and their carbonates decompose on heating.",
      "NaOH is prepared by the Castner-Kellner process (electrolysis of brine); Na₂CO₃ by the Solvay process."

The smaller Li atoms pack more closely together, leading to stronger electrostatic attraction between the metal cations and the delocalized electron cloud.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is A. Sodium actually has a lower melting point than lithium. This is because as you move down Group 1, the atomic size increases, which weakens the metallic bonding due to increased distance between the nucleus and the delocalized electrons. Lithium's compact structure and smaller size create stronger metallic bonds, resulting in a higher melting point."

The high charge-to-radius ratio of Be²⁺ allows it to attract water molecules very strongly, resulting in greater energy release during hydration. Ba²⁺, being much larger, has lower charge density and weaker ion-dipole interactions with water.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is A. Although both ions have a +2 charge, the size difference is crucial. Be²⁺ is extremely small with a very high charge density, which creates strong electrostatic attraction with the polar water molecules, releasing more energy during hydration. Ba²⁺, being a much larger ion, has its charge spread over a larger volume, resulting in lower charge density and consequently lower hydration enthalpy."

This is because the increase in atomic volume (due to additional electron shell) is proportionally greater than the increase in atomic mass. The larger atomic radius of potassium leads to more space between atoms, reducing overall density despite higher atomic mass.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is A. Although potassium has a higher atomic mass than sodium, it is actually less dense. This anomaly occurs because potassium's atomic radius is significantly larger due to an additional electron shell, and this volume increase outweighs the mass increase. The atoms are more spread out in potassium, resulting in lower density despite greater mass."

      "explanation_correct": "BeCl₂ exhibits significant covalent character while BaCl₂ is predominantly ionic. This is explained by Fajans' rules: Be²⁺ is a small cation with very high charge density, giving it strong polarizing power. This allows Be²⁺ to distort the electron cloud of the Cl⁻ anion, leading to orbital overlap and covalent character. Ba²⁺, being much larger, has low charge density and weak polarizing power, resulting in mainly ionic bonding.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is A. BeCl₂ is actually covalent in nature, not ionic. The tiny Be²⁺ ion with its high charge density can polarize (distort) the electron cloud of chloride ions, leading to sharing of electrons and covalent bonding.

      "explanation_correct": "NaHCO₃ (sodium bicarbonate) decomposes at a much lower temperature (around 50-100°C) compared to Na₂CO₃ (sodium carbonate), which requires temperatures above 850°C. This is because bicarbonates are thermally less stable than carbonates. The presence of the hydrogen in the bicarbonate makes it easier to decompose to carbonate, releasing CO₂ and H₂O. Sodium carbonate, being already in the carbonate form with strong Na⁺-CO₃²⁻ ionic bonding, is very stable and resistant to thermal decomposition.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is A. NaHCO₃ readily decomposes on moderate heating (even during baking), which is why it's used as baking soda. It breaks down to form Na₂CO₃, CO₂, and H₂O. However, Na₂CO₃ is thermally very stable due to the large size and low charge density of Na⁺, which cannot polarize the carbonate ion effectively.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation_correct": "The correct identification is X = Na (sodium), Y = Li (lithium), Z = K (potassium). Sodium produces a characteristic golden yellow flame due to electronic transitions at 589 nm. Lithium gives a crimson red flame. Potassium produces a violet (lilac) flame, but since sodium's intense yellow can mask potassium's violet, cobalt glass (which filters out yellow light) is used to observe potassium's violet flame clearly. These flame colors are due to excitation of valence electrons and their subsequent emission of characteristic wavelengths.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is A (Na, Li, K). The flame colors are diagnostic: golden yellow is uniquely sodium, crimson red is lithium, and violet (especially when viewed through cobalt glass to eliminate sodium contamination) is potassium. The use of cobalt glass is a key technique in qualitative analysis to distinguish potassium from sodium in flame tests, as the yellow of sodium is very intense and can overpower other colors. This is an important practical skill in ISC/JEE chemistry practicals."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "Lithium carbonate (Li₂CO₃) is the exception. Unlike other alkali metal carbonates which are thermally very stable, Li₂CO₃ decomposes on heating to form Li₂O and CO₂: Li₂CO₃ → Li₂O + CO₂. This anomalous behavior is due to lithium's very small ionic size and high charge density, which gives Li⁺ high polarizing power. This makes lithium behave more like magnesium (diagonal relationship) rather than other alkali metals. The strong polarization destabilizes the carbonate ion, making decomposition feasible.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is C (Li₂CO₃). While Na₂CO₃, K₂CO₃, and Cs₂CO₃ require extremely high temperatures (above 850°C) and do not decompose under normal laboratory heating, Li₂CO₃ readily decomposes around 1300°C, which is relatively low for carbonates. This is a classic example of lithium's anomalous behavior in Group 1, caused by its exceptionally small size and high charge density. Students often incorrectly assume all alkali metal carbonates are equally stable."

This amphoteric nature is due to beryllium's very small size, high charge density, and high polarizing power, which gives its compounds significant covalent character rather than purely ionic nature.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is C (Be(OH)₂). Students commonly mistake all Group 2 hydroxides as purely basic, but beryllium hydroxide is amphoteric like aluminium hydroxide. This is another example of beryllium's anomalous behavior and its diagonal relationship with aluminium.

This paramagnetic superoxide ion can undergo electronic transitions, giving the compound its characteristic orange-yellow color.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is B (KO₂). NaCl, Li₂CO₃, and NaOH are all white/colorless compounds.

Transition metals are defined by having partially filled d-orbitals in their ground state or common oxidation states. Although Mg has two valence electrons like some transition metals (e.g., Zn), these electrons are in s-orbitals, not d-orbitals.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation_correct": "Although lithium has the highest ionization enthalpy among alkali metals (which would work against it being a reducing agent), it is the strongest reducing agent in aqueous solution. This is because reducing power in solution depends on the overall energy change, which includes ionization enthalpy, sublimation enthalpy, and hydration enthalpy. Li⁺ is extremely small and has very high hydration enthalpy (energy released when Li⁺ is surrounded by water molecules). This large negative hydration enthalpy more than compensates for the high ionization enthalpy, making the overall process of Li → Li⁺(aq) + e⁻ most favorable energetically.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is A. This is a subtle concept that students often get wrong. In the gaseous phase, cesium would be the best reducing agent (lowest ionization enthalpy). However, in solution, we must consider the hydration energy. The tiny Li⁺ ion creates such a strong electric field that water molecules are very strongly attracted to it, releasing enormous energy during hydration. This energy release is larger than the extra energy needed for ionization, making lithium the best reducing agent in solution despite its high ionization enthalpy. Options B, C, and D do not explain this apparent paradox."

These hydroxide ions increase the pH of the solution above 7, making it basic. The Arrhenius definition of a base is a substance that produces OH⁻ ions in aqueous solution. While Ca(OH)₂ does 'donate' OH⁻ in a sense, this release of OH⁻ is what makes it basic, not acidic. Acids, on the other hand, produce H⁺ ions in solution.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is A. While options B and D contain some truth, they are not the fundamental reason for classification. Option B is superficial - containing a metal doesn't define a base. Option D (neutralizes acids) is a consequence of being a base, not the defining reason. Option C is irrelevant to acid-base classification. The key is understanding that acids produce H⁺ ions while bases produce OH⁻ ions in solution according to Arrhenius theory. Ca(OH)₂ releases OH⁻ ions, thereby increasing pH and fitting the definition of a base."
