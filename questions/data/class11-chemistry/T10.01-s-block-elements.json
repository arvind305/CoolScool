    "text": "The s-block elements comprise Group 1 (alkali metals: Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Fr) and Group 2 (alkaline earth metals: Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba, Ra). They have ns¹ and ns² configurations respectively. Alkali metals are the most reactive metals: soft, low melting, and form strongly basic hydroxides. Alkaline earth metals are harder, have higher melting points, and show +2 oxidation state. Both groups show regular trends in properties down the group. Lithium and beryllium show anomalous behavior due to small size and high charge density, leading to diagonal relationships (Li-Mg, Be-Al). Important compounds include NaOH (caustic soda), Na₂CO₃ (washing soda), NaHCO₃ (baking soda), CaO (quicklime), Ca(OH)₂ (slaked lime), and CaSO₄·½H₂O (Plaster of Paris).",
    "rules": [
      "Alkali metals have the lowest ionization enthalpies in their respective periods and are the strongest reducing agents.",
      "Down Group 1 and 2: atomic radius increases, ionization enthalpy decreases, reactivity increases.",
      "Lithium shows diagonal relationship with magnesium: both form nitrides, covalent organometallic compounds, and their carbonates decompose on heating.",
      "NaOH is prepared by the Castner-Kellner process (electrolysis of brine); Na₂CO₃ by the Solvay process."

Beryllium sulfate (BeSO₄) is soluble in water, while barium sulfate (BaSO₄) is insoluble. This trend is due to the increasing size and decreasing charge density of the cations down the group, which affects the strength of the ionic bonds with the sulfate anion.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement is true, not false. As you move down Group 2 (alkaline earth metals), the size of the cations increases, and their charge density decreases.

This is due to the small size and high charge density of lithium, which makes it behave more like the alkaline earth metal magnesium rather than the other alkali metals.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is magnesium. Lithium has a diagonal relationship with magnesium because they have similar atomic sizes and charge densities, despite being in different groups.
