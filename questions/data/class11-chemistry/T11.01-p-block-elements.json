    "text": "For Class 11, p-block elements covers Groups 13 (boron family) and 14 (carbon family). Group 13 elements (B, Al, Ga, In, Tl) have ns²np¹ configuration with +3 as the common oxidation state, though the inert pair effect makes +1 stable for heavier elements like Tl. Boron is a metalloid; aluminium is amphoteric. Important boron compounds include borax (Na₂B₄O₇·10H₂O), boric acid (H₃BO₃), and diborane (B₂H₆) with its unique three-centre two-electron bonds. Group 14 elements (C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) have ns²np² configuration; carbon shows catenation (forming long chains) and exists as allotropes (diamond, graphite, fullerenes). Silicon forms silicones (organosilicon polymers), silicates, and zeolites. The inert pair effect is prominent in Pb, which favors +2 state.",

      "Group 13: +3 oxidation state is common; inert pair effect makes +1 stable for Tl.",
      "Boron is electron-deficient and forms three-centre two-electron (3c-2e) bonds in diborane.",
      "Group 14: Carbon shows catenation (ability to form long C-C chains); silicon does not catenate well due to weaker Si-Si bonds.",
      "Allotropes of carbon: diamond (sp³, hardest), graphite (sp², conductor), fullerene (C₆₀, soccer-ball shape)."

This is due to the stability imparted by the lone pair of electrons in the outermost 6s orbital.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The large atomic radius, high electronegativity, or absence of d-orbitals do not directly cause the +1 oxidation state to be more stable for thallium. The key reason is the inert pair effect, where the 6s electrons in the outermost shell of Tl become reluctant to participate in bonding, making the +1 state more favorable than the expected +3 state."

This tendency to achieve the +2 state makes PbO₂ a stronger oxidant compared to SnO₂, where Sn⁴⁺ is less inclined to be reduced.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement is incorrect because Sn⁴⁺ is actually the more stable oxidation state for tin, not Sn²⁺. PbO₂ is a stronger oxidizing agent than SnO₂ because Pb⁴⁺ can more easily gain electrons to reach the +2 oxidation state, which is the more common and stable form for lead.

      "explanation_correct": "The first ionization enthalpy of Ga is lower than that of Al due to the increased shielding of the nuclear charge by the 3d electrons in Ga. This makes it easier to remove the 4s electron in Ga compared to the 3s electron in Al, resulting in a lower first ionization enthalpy for Ga.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The first ionization enthalpy of an element depends on the nuclear charge and the shielding of the nuclear charge by the inner electrons. Since Ga has a higher atomic number than Al, it has a greater nuclear charge. While Ga has 3d electrons that can provide some shielding, this shielding effect is not strong enough to overcome the higher nuclear charge in Ga compared to Al. Therefore, the first ionization enthalpy of Ga is actually higher than that of Al."

This is because the inert pair effect, where the outermost s-electrons become less reactive, becomes more prominent as you go down the group.

Phosphoric acid is a triprotic Brønsted acid that can donate up to three protons sequentially. This fundamental difference in acid mechanism distinguishes boric acid from typical oxyacids.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because H₃BO₃ does not donate three protons like H₃PO₄. Option C is wrong as H₃PO₄ is primarily a Brønsted acid, not a Lewis acid. Option D is incorrect because both are weak acids, but they differ in their acidic mechanisms. The key difference (option B) is that boric acid accepts OH⁻ (Lewis acid behavior) while phosphoric acid donates H⁺ (Brønsted acid behavior)."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "In the thermite reaction (2Al + Fe₂O₃ → Al₂O₃ + 2Fe), aluminium acts as a strong reducing agent. It donates electrons to Fe³⁺ ions, reducing them to metallic iron (Fe⁰), while aluminium itself is oxidized from Al⁰ to Al³⁺ in Al₂O₃. The reaction is highly exothermic, releasing enough heat to produce molten iron used in welding.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because aluminium is being oxidized (losing electrons), not reduced. Option C is wrong as aluminium is consumed in the reaction, not acting as a catalyst. Option D is incorrect because aluminium actively participates in the redox reaction. As a reducing agent (option B), aluminium's strong affinity for oxygen drives the reaction forward with significant heat release."

In contrast, SiCl₄, GeCl₄, and SnCl₄ all have vacant d-orbitals that can accept lone pairs from water, facilitating nucleophilic attack and hydrolysis. This is why CCl₄ is stable in water while SiCl₄ hydrolyzes violently.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Options A, C, and D all undergo hydrolysis because silicon, germanium, and tin have vacant d-orbitals available for expansion of their coordination sphere. CCl₄ is the exception because carbon (second period element) has no accessible d-orbitals. Additionally, the high C-Cl bond strength and carbon's small size create steric protection against nucleophilic attack by water."

In B₂H₆, there are only 12 valence electrons total (6 from two B atoms, 6 from six H atoms) but 8 bonds would be needed for conventional 2c-2e bonding. This electron deficiency is resolved through two 3-centre 2-electron (banana) bonds where one electron pair bonds one B atom to two H atoms simultaneously, allowing stable structure formation with fewer electrons.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because boron is electron-deficient, not electron-rich. Option C is wrong as the bonding preference comes from boron's deficiency, not hydrogen's preference. Option D is incorrect as boron has moderate electronegativity.

This amphoteric behavior is characteristic of aluminium compounds and demonstrates aluminium's intermediate position in the periodic table.",

This larger size results in longer Si-Si bonds with poorer overlap of valence orbitals, producing weaker bonds with lower bond enthalpy. The stronger C-C bonds allow carbon to form long stable chains (catenation), while silicon's weaker Si-Si bonds make silicon chains less stable, explaining why silicon shows limited catenation compared to carbon.",
