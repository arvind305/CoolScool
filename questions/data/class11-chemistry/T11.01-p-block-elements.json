    "text": "For Class 11, p-block elements covers Groups 13 (boron family) and 14 (carbon family). Group 13 elements (B, Al, Ga, In, Tl) have ns²np¹ configuration with +3 as the common oxidation state, though the inert pair effect makes +1 stable for heavier elements like Tl. Boron is a metalloid; aluminium is amphoteric. Important boron compounds include borax (Na₂B₄O₇·10H₂O), boric acid (H₃BO₃), and diborane (B₂H₆) with its unique three-centre two-electron bonds. Group 14 elements (C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) have ns²np² configuration; carbon shows catenation (forming long chains) and exists as allotropes (diamond, graphite, fullerenes). Silicon forms silicones (organosilicon polymers), silicates, and zeolites. The inert pair effect is prominent in Pb, which favors +2 state.",

      "Group 13: +3 oxidation state is common; inert pair effect makes +1 stable for Tl.",
      "Boron is electron-deficient and forms three-centre two-electron (3c-2e) bonds in diborane.",
      "Group 14: Carbon shows catenation (ability to form long C-C chains); silicon does not catenate well due to weaker Si-Si bonds.",
      "Allotropes of carbon: diamond (sp³, hardest), graphite (sp², conductor), fullerene (C₆₀, soccer-ball shape)."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The large atomic radius, high electronegativity, or absence of d-orbitals do not directly cause the +1 oxidation state to be more stable for thallium. The key reason is the inert pair effect, where the 6s electrons in the outermost shell of Tl become reluctant to participate in bonding, making the +1 state more favorable than the expected +3 state."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The other options are not ionic halides of Group 13 elements. BF₃ and BBr₃ are covalent compounds, while AlCl₃ is also an ionic compound. The key difference is that fluoride (F-) forms stronger ionic bonds compared to other halogens like chlorine (Cl-) or bromine (Br-), making AlF₃ the most ionic halide of a Group 13 element."

This makes it easier to remove the 4s electron in Ga compared to the 3s electron in Al, resulting in a lower first ionization enthalpy for Ga.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The first ionization enthalpy of an element depends on the nuclear charge and the shielding of the nuclear charge by the inner electrons. Since Ga has a higher atomic number than Al, it has a greater nuclear charge. While Ga has 3d electrons that can provide some shielding, this shielding effect is not strong enough to overcome the higher nuclear charge in Ga compared to Al.
