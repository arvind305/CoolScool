    "text": "Organic chemistry is the study of carbon compounds. Carbon's tetravalence and ability to form single, double, and triple bonds through sp³, sp², and sp hybridization allows enormous structural diversity. IUPAC nomenclature provides systematic naming for alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and functional groups. Isomerism includes structural isomerism (chain, position, functional group, metamerism) and stereoisomerism (geometrical/cis-trans and optical). Electronic displacement effects govern reactivity: the inductive effect (permanent polarization along sigma bonds), resonance (delocalization of pi electrons), electromeric effect (temporary shift in presence of reagent), and hyperconjugation (sigma-pi conjugation). Bond fission produces reactive intermediates: homolytic fission gives free radicals, heterolytic fission gives carbocations or carbanions. The stability order of carbocations is 3° > 2° > 1° > CH₃⁺. Purification methods include distillation, crystallization, and chromatography.",

      "Resonance structures must have the same arrangement of atoms but different distribution of electrons.",

      "explanation_correct": "The order of increasing separation power is simple filtration, distillation, crystallization, and column chromatography. Simple filtration separates the largest particles, while column chromatography can separate even the smallest molecules based on their interactions with the stationary phase.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be simple filtration, crystallization, distillation, and column chromatography. This is incorrect because crystallization is a more powerful separation technique than simple filtration, and column chromatography is the most powerful of the four methods, allowing separation of even very similar molecules."
