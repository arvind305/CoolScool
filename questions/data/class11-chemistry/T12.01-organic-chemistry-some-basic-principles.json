    "text": "Organic chemistry is the study of carbon compounds. Carbon's tetravalence and ability to form single, double, and triple bonds through sp³, sp², and sp hybridization allows enormous structural diversity. IUPAC nomenclature provides systematic naming for alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and functional groups. Isomerism includes structural isomerism (chain, position, functional group, metamerism) and stereoisomerism (geometrical/cis-trans and optical). Electronic displacement effects govern reactivity: the inductive effect (permanent polarization along sigma bonds), resonance (delocalization of pi electrons), electromeric effect (temporary shift in presence of reagent), and hyperconjugation (sigma-pi conjugation). Bond fission produces reactive intermediates: homolytic fission gives free radicals, heterolytic fission gives carbocations or carbanions. The stability order of carbocations is 3° > 2° > 1° > CH₃⁺. Purification methods include distillation, crystallization, and chromatography.",

      "Resonance structures must have the same arrangement of atoms but different distribution of electrons.",

When sodium nitroprusside (Na₂[Fe(CN)₅NO]) is added to the solution containing Na₂S, it reacts to form Na₄[Fe(CN)₅NOS], which produces a characteristic violet coloration. This confirms the presence of sulfur in the compound.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Nitrogen (A) is detected in Lassaigne's test by forming NaCN, which is then tested with ferrous sulfate and ferric chloride to give Prussian blue, not a violet color. Chlorine (B) is detected by acidifying the extract with nitric acid and adding silver nitrate to get a white precipitate (AgCl). Phosphorus (D) is not typically detected by Lassaigne's test. The violet color with sodium nitroprusside is specific to sulfur."

      "explanation_correct": "When the C-Br bond in (CH₃)₃C-Br undergoes heterolytic fission with both electrons going to bromine, a tertiary carbocation (CH₃)₃C⁺ is formed along with Br⁻. The positively charged carbon becomes sp² hybridized (losing one bonding pair leaves three bonds), giving it a trigonal planar geometry with an empty p-orbital perpendicular to the plane. This carbocation is relatively stable due to hyperconjugation from nine alpha-hydrogen atoms and the +I effect of three methyl groups.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because heterolytic fission (not homolytic) produces ions, not free radicals. Option C is wrong because a carbanion would form only if both electrons went to carbon. Option D correctly identifies the carbocation but assigns the wrong geometry: sp² hybridized carbocations are trigonal planar, not tetrahedral."

These combined effects significantly disperse the positive charge and lower the energy of the intermediate.",
