    "text": "Hydrocarbons are organic compounds containing only carbon and hydrogen. Alkanes (CₙH₂ₙ₊₂) are saturated hydrocarbons with sp³ hybridized carbons, prepared by Wurtz reaction and undergoing free radical substitution (halogenation) and combustion. Conformations of ethane include staggered (most stable) and eclipsed (least stable). Alkenes (CₙH₂ₙ) have C=C double bonds (sp²), prepared by dehydration of alcohols or dehydrohalogenation, and undergo addition reactions following Markovnikov's rule (or anti-Markovnikov with HBr/peroxide). Alkynes (CₙH₂ₙ₋₂) have C≡C triple bonds (sp), with terminal alkynes showing acidic character. Aromatic hydrocarbons, particularly benzene, exhibit resonance and aromaticity (Huckel's 4n+2 rule). Benzene undergoes electrophilic aromatic substitution: halogenation, nitration, sulphonation, and Friedel-Crafts reactions. Substituent effects direct incoming groups to ortho/para or meta positions.",
    "rules": [
      "Markovnikov's rule: In addition of HX to an unsymmetrical alkene, H adds to the carbon with more H atoms (forming the more stable carbocation intermediate).",
      "Anti-Markovnikov addition: HBr with peroxide follows the peroxide (Kharasch) effect giving anti-Markovnikov product via free radical mechanism.",
      "Huckel's rule: A planar, cyclic, fully conjugated system with (4n+2) pi electrons is aromatic.",
      "Ortho/para directors: -OH, -NH₂, -OR, -CH₃, halogens (activating except halogens which are deactivating); Meta directors: -NO₂, -COOH, -CHO, -CN, -SO₃H (deactivating)."
