    "text": "Environmental chemistry studies the chemical phenomena occurring in the environment. Air pollution includes primary pollutants (SO₂, NO₂, CO, particulates) and secondary pollutants (ozone, PAN) formed by photochemical reactions. Classical smog (London type) occurs in cold, humid conditions from SO₂ and particulates; photochemical smog (Los Angeles type) involves NOₓ, hydrocarbons, and sunlight producing ozone and PAN. Acid rain forms when SO₂ and NOₓ react with water to produce H₂SO₄ and HNO₃ (pH < 5.6). The ozone layer is depleted by CFCs through catalytic cycles involving Cl radicals. The greenhouse effect traps heat via CO₂, CH₄, N₂O, and CFCs, leading to global warming. Water pollution is measured by BOD (biological oxygen demand); eutrophication results from excess nutrients. Green chemistry principles aim to prevent pollution at the source through atom economy, safer solvents, and energy efficiency.",
    "rules": [
      "Acid rain: SO₂ + H₂O → H₂SO₃ → H₂SO₄; 2NO₂ + H₂O → HNO₃ + HNO₂. Rain with pH below 5.6 is considered acid rain.",
      "Ozone depletion: CFCl₃ → CFCl₂ + Cl·; Cl· + O₃ → ClO· + O₂; ClO· + O → Cl· + O₂ (catalytic cycle).",
      "BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand): the amount of dissolved oxygen needed by microorganisms to decompose organic matter; higher BOD indicates more pollution.",
      "Green chemistry aims for 100% atom economy, use of renewable feedstocks, safer solvents, and prevention rather than cleanup."

      "explanation_correct": "The major cause of acid rain is the emission of sulfur dioxide (SO₂) and nitrogen oxides (NOₓ) from industrial processes and vehicle emissions. These gases react with water in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) and nitric acid (HNO₃), which then fall back to the Earth's surface as acid rain.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Carbon dioxide (CO₂) and methane (CH₄) are greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming, but they do not directly cause acid rain. Ozone (O₃) and carbon monoxide (CO) are also not the primary causes of acid rain. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and nitrous oxide (N₂O) are more closely linked to ozone depletion, not acid rain formation."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "Rain is considered 'acid rain' when its pH is below 5.6 because the pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with 7 being neutral. A pH below 7 is considered acidic, and acid rain has a pH lower than 5.6 due to the presence of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the atmosphere, which react with water to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is C) 5.6. This is because the definition of acid rain is when the pH of rain is below 5.6. Anything above 5.6 is not considered acid rain. The other options, such as 7.0, 6.5, and 4.0, do not accurately represent the pH threshold for acid rain."

      "explanation_correct": "Bioaccumulation is the buildup of a pollutant (like heavy metals or DDT) in a single organism over its lifetime, as the organism absorbs the substance faster than it can eliminate it. Biomagnification is the process by which pollutant concentrations increase at each successive trophic level of a food chain. For example, small fish accumulate mercury from water (bioaccumulation), but when larger fish eat many small fish, the mercury concentration increases (biomagnification), and top predators end up with the highest concentrations. Both processes are related but occur at different scales.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "These are distinct but related processes. Bioaccumulation happens within individual organisms as they take in and store pollutants faster than they can eliminate them. Biomagnification is a food chain phenomenon where the concentration increases as you move up trophic levels. A small fish might bioaccumulate some mercury, but when a large fish eats hundreds of small fish, the mercury biomagnifies to much higher concentrations. Understanding this difference is crucial for predicting which organisms are most at risk from persistent pollutants."

CO is produced by incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels when insufficient oxygen is available. Its most dangerous property is that it binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells about 200-250 times more strongly than oxygen does, forming carboxyhemoglobin and preventing oxygen transport to body tissues, which can lead to suffocation and death even at relatively low concentrations.",

This process occurs when water bodies receive excess nutrients (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus from agricultural runoff, sewage, or detergents), leading to rapid growth of algae and aquatic plants. When these organisms die and decompose, aerobic bacteria consume the dissolved oxygen, depleting it and causing death of fish and other aquatic life. The pH of 6.8 is slightly acidic but within normal range for eutrophic conditions.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Thermal pollution involves temperature increase without nutrient enrichment. Acid rain would show much lower pH (below 5.6) and wouldn't necessarily cause algal blooms. Heavy metal pollution would show toxicity symptoms and bioaccumulation but not the characteristic nutrient enrichment and algal bloom pattern. The combination of high nutrients, algal growth, and oxygen depletion specifically indicates eutrophication, making it the correct classification."

      "explanation_correct": "Option B exemplifies multiple green chemistry principles: (1) Safer solvents—replacing toxic benzene with water or ethanol (safer alternatives), (2) Atom economy—using a catalyst to reduce waste from 40% to 5%, meaning more reactant atoms end up in the product, (3) Energy efficiency—lowering the temperature from 80°C to 40°C reduces energy consumption. Green chemistry focuses on prevention rather than treatment, so redesigning the process to minimize waste and hazards at the source is better than cleaning up pollution afterward.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A (treating waste) contradicts the green chemistry principle that prevention is better than treatment. Options C and D make the process worse—higher temperatures increase energy use, and more benzene increases toxic solvent use. The green chemistry approach is to redesign the entire process to be inherently safer and more efficient, which option B achieves through safer solvents, better atom economy via catalysis, and lower energy requirements."

The key indicators are: (1) hot, sunny afternoon—photochemical smog requires sunlight and warmth, (2) heavy traffic—source of NOₓ and hydrocarbons, (3) eye and throat irritation—characteristic symptoms of ozone and PAN in photochemical smog, and (4) brownish haze—NO₂ gives photochemical smog its characteristic brown color. In sunlight, NOₓ from vehicles undergoes photochemical reactions with hydrocarbons to produce secondary pollutants (O₃, PAN) that cause the observed symptoms.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Classical smog requires cold, humid conditions and produces a grayish, sulfurous fog, not a brownish haze on hot sunny days. Acid rain is precipitation, not a daytime haze. While particulates may be present, they alone don't explain the eye irritation and brownish color, which are specific to photochemical smog's secondary pollutants. The combination of warm weather, sunlight, traffic, and specific symptoms points definitively to photochemical smog."

While N₂ makes up 78% of Earth's atmosphere, it is transparent to both incoming solar radiation and outgoing infrared radiation. In contrast, CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O are all greenhouse gases that absorb and re-emit infrared radiation, trapping heat in the atmosphere. Students often confuse N₂ (nitrogen gas) with N₂O (nitrous oxide), which is a potent greenhouse gas.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "This is a common misconception. While nitrogen (N₂) is the most abundant gas in the atmosphere, it is not a greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases must be able to absorb infrared radiation, which requires certain molecular properties like asymmetry or the ability to vibrate in ways that create a changing dipole moment. Nitrogen gas, being a simple diatomic molecule with a strong triple bond, lacks these properties. Only CO₂, CH₄, and N₂O (along with water vapor and CFCs) function as greenhouse gases."

      "explanation_correct": "Stratospheric ozone depletion is an atmospheric phenomenon that occurs in the upper atmosphere (stratosphere, 15-50 km altitude) and does not directly cause water pollution. Ozone depletion results from CFCs breaking down ozone molecules, which allows more UV radiation to reach Earth's surface. While this has environmental consequences (skin cancer, damage to marine phytoplankton), it is not a source of water pollution in the same way that industrial waste, agricultural chemicals, or sewage directly contaminate water bodies. Students sometimes incorrectly assume all environmental problems are interconnected in direct ways.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Industrial effluents release heavy metals (mercury, cadmium, lead) and toxic chemicals into water. Agricultural runoff carries pesticides, herbicides, and excess fertilizers (nitrates, phosphates) causing eutrophication. Domestic sewage adds organic matter, pathogens, and nutrients to water bodies. All three directly pollute water. Ozone depletion, however, is an atmospheric problem affecting UV radiation levels, not a source of chemical or biological water contamination, making it the exception."

Green chemistry actually advocates for: (1) minimizing or eliminating the use of toxic solvents, (2) using safer alternatives like water, ethanol, or supercritical CO₂, and (3) designing solvent-free reactions when possible. The goal is to reduce hazards and environmental impact. Students sometimes mistakenly believe that using more reagents or solvents improves reactions, but green chemistry seeks efficiency and safety through better design, catalysis, and alternative reaction conditions rather than through excessive use of hazardous materials.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Options A, C, and D are all core principles of green chemistry. Prevention over treatment (A) is the first principle. Energy efficiency (C) reduces environmental impact and costs. Renewable feedstocks (D) ensure sustainability. However, green chemistry specifically opposes the use of toxic solvents when safer alternatives exist, and certainly does not advocate using maximum amounts of them.

      "explanation_correct": "Carbon monoxide is classified as a primary pollutant because it is emitted directly from pollution sources into the atmosphere in its final form. It is produced by incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels in vehicles, industrial processes, and domestic heating when insufficient oxygen is available. Primary pollutants are those that enter the atmosphere directly from identifiable sources. In contrast, secondary pollutants (like ozone and PAN) are formed by chemical reactions between primary pollutants in the atmosphere. CO is emitted as CO, not formed from other atmospheric chemicals, making it a primary pollutant by definition.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The classification as primary versus secondary pollutant is based solely on whether the substance is directly emitted or formed by atmospheric reactions, not on its toxicity, greenhouse potential, or any other property. CO does not form through photochemical reactions—it comes directly from combustion sources. While CO is indeed dangerous and can act as a very weak greenhouse gas, these properties are irrelevant to its classification. The key reason is its direct emission from sources."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Eutrophication is considered pollution because it involves an excessive concentration of naturally occurring nutrients beyond what the ecosystem can handle. While nitrogen and phosphorus are essential for plant growth in normal amounts, their excess (from fertilizer runoff, sewage, detergents) causes rapid, uncontrolled algal growth (algal bloom). When these algae die, aerobic bacteria decompose them, consuming dissolved oxygen in the water. This oxygen depletion (hypoxia) kills fish and other aquatic life. The problem is not the nutrients themselves, but their concentration exceeding natural levels, which disrupts the ecological balance and degrades water quality.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Nitrogen and phosphorus are not inherently toxic—they are essential nutrients for life. They don't make water acidic; in fact, eutrophic waters often have neutral or slightly alkaline pH. Algae are not inherently harmful; they are the base of aquatic food chains. The issue is the excessive, unnatural abundance of nutrients causing overgrowth, which leads to a cascade of ecological problems culminating in oxygen depletion. This demonstrates that pollution is defined by harmful effects on ecosystems, not just the presence of toxic chemicals."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "CFCs are uniquely damaging because of their exceptional stability in the lower atmosphere (troposphere). Unlike other chlorine compounds (like HCl from sea spray or industrial sources), CFCs are not water-soluble and do not react readily, allowing them to persist for decades and gradually diffuse upward into the stratosphere. Once in the stratosphere, intense UV radiation breaks the C-Cl bonds, releasing highly reactive chlorine radicals. These radicals destroy ozone catalytically—one chlorine atom can destroy thousands of ozone molecules through a repeating cycle before being removed. The combination of stability (allowing stratospheric transport) and catalytic destruction makes CFCs uniquely harmful.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "CFCs don't necessarily contain the most chlorine per molecule, nor are they produced in the largest quantities globally. They are actually not water-soluble, which is part of why they're problematic—water-soluble chlorine compounds like HCl get washed out by rain. The key factor is the combination of chemical stability (allowing them to reach the stratosphere) and the catalytic nature of ozone destruction (one Cl· destroying many O₃ molecules). This makes CFCs far more damaging per molecule than other chlorine sources."
