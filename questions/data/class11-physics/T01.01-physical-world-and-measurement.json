    "text": "Physics is a quantitative science built on precise measurement of physical quantities. Every physical quantity is expressed as a number multiplied by a unit. The International System of Units (SI) defines seven base quantities — length (metre), mass (kilogram), time (second), electric current (ampere), temperature (kelvin), amount of substance (mole) and luminous intensity (candela) — from which all other derived quantities are obtained. Dimensional analysis uses the powers of base dimensions (M, L, T, etc.) to check the homogeneity of equations, derive relationships between quantities and convert units between systems. Measurements always carry uncertainty; errors are classified as systematic (instrument, personal, environmental) and random. The concepts of significant figures and rounding govern how precisely a result should be reported, while the rules for propagation of errors (absolute errors add in sums/differences; relative errors add in products/quotients) allow calculation of uncertainty in derived quantities.",
    "rules": [
      "Every physical quantity equals a numerical value multiplied by a unit; only quantities with the same dimensions can be added or equated (principle of homogeneity).",
      "The dimensional formula of a quantity is written as [M^a L^b T^c ...]; if two sides of an equation have different dimensions, the equation is necessarily wrong.",
      "In multiplication or division the result retains the number of significant figures equal to the least number of significant figures in any factor; in addition or subtraction the result retains decimal places equal to the fewest decimal places in any term.",
      "Absolute error = |measured value − true value|; relative error = absolute error / true value; percentage error = relative error × 100.",
      "For a quantity Z = A^p × B^q / C^r, the maximum fractional error is ΔZ/Z = p(ΔA/A) + q(ΔB/B) + r(ΔC/C)."

Therefore, the correct order is 0.005, 50, 5.00, 5.000.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to arrange the measurements based on their numerical values, rather than the number of significant figures. This is wrong because significant figures indicate the precision of the measurement, which is more important than the numerical value alone. The correct order is determined by the number of non-zero digits in each measurement, not just the numerical value."

While the metre scale and measuring tape are both linear measuring instruments, the metre scale has a smaller least count and is more precise than the measuring tape. The Vernier callipers and screw gauge have even smaller least counts, making them the most precise instruments in the list."
