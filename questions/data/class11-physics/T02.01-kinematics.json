    "text": "Kinematics is the branch of mechanics that describes the motion of objects without considering the forces causing the motion. Motion is described using quantities such as displacement (a vector), velocity (rate of change of displacement) and acceleration (rate of change of velocity). For uniformly accelerated motion in a straight line, the three kinematic equations — v = u + at, s = ut + ½at², and v² = u² + 2as — relate initial velocity u, final velocity v, acceleration a, displacement s and time t. Graphical analysis of displacement-time, velocity-time and acceleration-time graphs provides additional insight: the slope of an s-t graph gives velocity, the slope of a v-t graph gives acceleration, and the area under a v-t graph gives displacement. Motion in two dimensions includes projectile motion (a combination of uniform horizontal motion and uniformly accelerated vertical motion under gravity) and uniform circular motion (constant speed along a circular path with centripetal acceleration v²/r directed towards the centre). Vector algebra — addition, subtraction, resolution into rectangular components and the use of unit vectors — is essential for analysing two-dimensional motion and relative velocity problems.",
    "rules": [
      "Displacement is a vector (shortest path from start to end); distance is a scalar (total path length).",
      "The three equations of uniformly accelerated motion are: v = u + at, s = ut + ½at², and v² = u² + 2as, valid only when acceleration is constant.",
      "For projectile motion on level ground: time of flight T = 2u sinθ/g, maximum height H = u² sin²θ/(2g), range R = u² sin 2θ/g.",
      "In uniform circular motion the centripetal acceleration a = v²/r is always directed towards the centre of the circle.",
      "Relative velocity of A with respect to B is v_AB = v_A − v_B (vector subtraction)."

      "correct_answer": "10",
      "explanation_correct": "The magnitude of the resultant of two vectors at right angles is given by the Pythagorean Theorem. Since the two vectors have magnitudes of 6 and 8, the magnitude of their resultant is sqrt(6^2 + 8^2) = 10.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to simply add the magnitudes of the two vectors, which is 6 + 8 = 14. However, this is not the correct way to find the magnitude of the resultant of two vectors at right angles. The correct approach is to use the Pythagorean Theorem, which gives the magnitude of the resultant as 10."

      "correct_answer": "100",
      "explanation_correct": "The relative velocity between the two trains is calculated by adding their individual velocities in the opposite direction. Since the first train is moving east at 60 km/h and the second train is moving west at 40 km/h, the relative velocity of the first train with respect to the second is 60 km/h + 40 km/h = 100 km/h eastward.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be 20 km/h eastward. This is because the student may have subtracted the individual velocities instead of adding them, thinking that the relative velocity is the difference between the two train velocities. However, the correct answer is 100 km/h eastward, as the relative velocity is calculated by adding the individual velocities in the opposite direction."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be something like 'acceleration'. While acceleration is also an important quantity in kinematics, the slope of the displacement-time graph gives the velocity, not the acceleration. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, so it would be represented by the slope of the velocity-time graph, not the displacement-time graph."
