    "text": "Newton's laws of motion form the foundation of classical mechanics. The first law (law of inertia) states that a body remains at rest or in uniform straight-line motion unless acted upon by an external net force. The second law quantifies this: the net force on a body equals the product of its mass and acceleration (F = ma). The third law states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction, with the two forces acting on different bodies. Free-body diagrams are the standard tool for identifying all forces on an object and applying Newton's second law. Friction — the tangential contact force that opposes relative motion — is characterised by coefficients of static (μs) and kinetic (μk) friction, with static friction having a maximum value μsN. The impulse-momentum theorem (FΔt = Δp) connects force and time to the change in linear momentum, while conservation of momentum applies to isolated systems, making it invaluable for analysing collisions. Circular motion requires a centripetal force mv²/r directed towards the centre, which in problems such as banking of roads or vertical circles comes from combinations of gravity, normal force and friction. Connected-body problems involving pulleys and inclined planes are solved by drawing separate free-body diagrams and applying F = ma to each body.",

Kinetic friction is always less than the maximum value of static friction. This is because once an object starts moving, the frictional force drops to a constant, lower value of kinetic friction.

      "explanation_correct": "The impulse experienced by the object is the change in its momentum, which is calculated as mass × change in velocity. Since the mass is 2 kg and the velocity changes from 3 m/s to 7 m/s, the change in momentum is 2 kg × (7 m/s - 3 m/s) = 8 N·s.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is a single number, so writing '8 N·s' is incorrect. The correct answer is just '8', which represents the change in momentum of the 2 kg object when its velocity changes from 3 m/s to 7 m/s. The impulse experienced is equal to this change in momentum, which is calculated as mass × change in velocity."

      "correct_answer": "36",
      "explanation_correct": "The centripetal force on the 2 kg mass moving in a circle of radius 0.5 m at 3 m/s is 36 N. This can be calculated using the formula for centripetal force: F = mv^2/r, where m is the mass, v is the velocity, and r is the radius of the circle. Plugging in the values gives F = 2 kg * (3 m/s)^2 / 0.5 m = 36 N.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format for this question is a single number, 36. An incorrect explanation might state that the centripetal force is 18 N, which is incorrect. The correct formula for centripetal force is F = mv^2/r, and plugging in the given values of m = 2 kg, v = 3 m/s, and r = 0.5 m results in F = 36 N, not 18 N."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be something other than 4 m/s². For example, if you assumed the acceleration was just g = 10 m/s², that would be wrong. The correct formula needs to take into account the masses of the two hanging objects to calculate the net acceleration of the system."

      "correct_answer": "350",
      "explanation_correct": "The apparent weight of the person in the accelerating lift is 350 N. This is because the person's true weight is 50 kg x 10 m/s² = 500 N, but the downward acceleration of 3 m/s² reduces their apparent weight by 150 N, to 350 N.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be 500 N, which is the person's true weight. However, since the lift is accelerating downward at 3 m/s², the person's apparent weight is reduced by the downward acceleration. The correct formula to calculate the apparent weight is: Apparent weight = True weight - Mass x Acceleration, which gives 500 N - (50 kg x 3 m/s²) = 350 N."
