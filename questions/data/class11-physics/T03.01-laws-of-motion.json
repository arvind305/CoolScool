    "text": "Newton's laws of motion form the foundation of classical mechanics. The first law (law of inertia) states that a body remains at rest or in uniform straight-line motion unless acted upon by an external net force. The second law quantifies this: the net force on a body equals the product of its mass and acceleration (F = ma). The third law states that every action has an equal and opposite reaction, with the two forces acting on different bodies. Free-body diagrams are the standard tool for identifying all forces on an object and applying Newton's second law. Friction — the tangential contact force that opposes relative motion — is characterised by coefficients of static (μs) and kinetic (μk) friction, with static friction having a maximum value μsN. The impulse-momentum theorem (FΔt = Δp) connects force and time to the change in linear momentum, while conservation of momentum applies to isolated systems, making it invaluable for analysing collisions. Circular motion requires a centripetal force mv²/r directed towards the centre, which in problems such as banking of roads or vertical circles comes from combinations of gravity, normal force and friction. Connected-body problems involving pulleys and inclined planes are solved by drawing separate free-body diagrams and applying F = ma to each body.",

This is because once the object starts moving, the frictional force drops to a lower, constant value of kinetic friction, which is less than the maximum static friction force required to just start the object moving.",

Kinetic friction is always less than the maximum value of static friction. This is because once an object starts moving, the frictional force drops to a constant, lower value of kinetic friction.
