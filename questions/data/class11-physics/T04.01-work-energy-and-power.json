    "text": "Work is defined as the scalar product of force and displacement: W = F·s·cos θ, where θ is the angle between the force and displacement vectors. When force and displacement are perpendicular, no work is done. The work-energy theorem states that the net work done on an object equals the change in its kinetic energy (W_net = ΔKE). Kinetic energy is the energy of motion (KE = ½mv²), while potential energy is the energy of position or configuration — gravitational PE equals mgh for objects near Earth's surface, and elastic PE equals ½kx² for a spring obeying Hooke's law. The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that in the absence of non-conservative forces (like friction), the total mechanical energy (KE + PE) remains constant. Conservative forces (gravity, spring force) have the property that work done is path-independent, while non-conservative forces (friction, air resistance) dissipate mechanical energy as heat. Power is the rate of doing work: P = W/t = F·v (when force is along velocity). The SI unit of power is the watt (1 W = 1 J/s). These concepts are fundamental to analysing collisions, pendulums, spring-mass systems and practical machines.",

The decrease in potential energy of 40 J is converted to an increase in kinetic energy, which gives a speed of √(2×40/1) = √80 m/s.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be 20 m/s. This is because the student may have mistakenly thought that the change in height (from 10 m to 6 m) is 4 m, and used the formula for gravitational potential energy (PE = mgh) to calculate the final speed as √(2×40/1) = 20 m/s. However, the correct approach is to use the conservation of mechanical energy, since the track is frictionless."

      "correct_answer": "20",
      "explanation_correct": "The power of the engine is 2000 W and the resistance force is 100 N. Using the formula for power (P = F·v), we can solve for the velocity v = P/F = 2000 W / 100 N = 20 m/s. This is the constant velocity at which the engine pulls the body against the 100 N resistance.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "If the answer was 10 m/s, that would be incorrect. The power of the engine is 2000 W and the resistance force is 100 N. The correct velocity can be calculated as v = P/F = 2000 W / 100 N = 20 m/s. The accepted answer format is a single number, 20, not 10 m/s."

      "correct_answer": "20",
      "explanation_correct": "The work done on the spring is given by the formula W = 1/2 k (x2^2 - x1^2), where k is the spring constant and x1, x2 are the initial and final extensions of the spring. Plugging in the values, we get W = 1/2 * 500 N/m * (0.3^2 - 0.1^2) = 20 J.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to simply calculate the total change in extension of the spring, which is 0.3 m - 0.1 m = 0.2 m. However, the work done is not just the product of the force and the displacement, but rather the integral of the force over the displacement. The correct formula, as mentioned in the explanation above, gives the work done as 20 J."

      "correct_answer": "8",
      "explanation_correct": "The height after the first bounce is 8 m because the ball loses 20% of its energy on each bounce. The initial gravitational potential energy of the ball at 10 m is 196 J (2 kg × 10 m × 9.8 m/s^2). After the first bounce, 20% of this energy is lost, leaving 156.8 J, which corresponds to a height of 8 m (156.8 J / (2 kg × 9.8 m/s^2)).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is a single number, in this case 8. The incorrect explanation might be that the height after the first bounce is 6 m. This is wrong because the ball loses 20% of its energy on each bounce, not 50%. The correct calculation shows that after the first bounce, the ball's gravitational potential energy is reduced by 20% from the initial 196 J, leaving 156.8 J, which corresponds to a height of 8 m."

      "correct_answer": "zero",
      "explanation_correct": "For a conservative force, the work done around any closed path is zero because the work done is path-independent. This means that the final position of the object does not depend on the path taken, only on the initial and final positions. Since the work done is the same regardless of the path, the total work done around a closed path is zero.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'zero'. This is because for conservative forces like gravity or spring force, the work done depends only on the initial and final positions of the object, and not the path taken. If you move an object along a closed path, it ends up back at the starting point, so the net displacement is zero. Since the work done is proportional to the displacement, the total work done around a closed path is zero."
