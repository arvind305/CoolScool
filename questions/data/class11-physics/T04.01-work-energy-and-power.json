    "text": "Work is defined as the scalar product of force and displacement: W = F·s·cos θ, where θ is the angle between the force and displacement vectors. When force and displacement are perpendicular, no work is done. The work-energy theorem states that the net work done on an object equals the change in its kinetic energy (W_net = ΔKE). Kinetic energy is the energy of motion (KE = ½mv²), while potential energy is the energy of position or configuration — gravitational PE equals mgh for objects near Earth's surface, and elastic PE equals ½kx² for a spring obeying Hooke's law. The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that in the absence of non-conservative forces (like friction), the total mechanical energy (KE + PE) remains constant. Conservative forces (gravity, spring force) have the property that work done is path-independent, while non-conservative forces (friction, air resistance) dissipate mechanical energy as heat. Power is the rate of doing work: P = W/t = F·v (when force is along velocity). The SI unit of power is the watt (1 W = 1 J/s). These concepts are fundamental to analysing collisions, pendulums, spring-mass systems and practical machines.",

This is because the student may have mistakenly thought that the change in height (from 10 m to 6 m) is 4 m, and used the formula for gravitational potential energy (PE = mgh) to calculate the final speed as √(2×40/1) = 20 m/s. However, the correct approach is to use the conservation of mechanical energy, since the track is frictionless."
