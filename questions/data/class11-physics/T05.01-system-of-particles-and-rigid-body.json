    "text": "The centre of mass of a system of particles is a unique point whose motion represents the motion of the entire system when acted upon by external forces. For two particles of masses m₁ and m₂ separated by distance d, the centre of mass lies at x_cm = (m₁x₁ + m₂x₂)/(m₁ + m₂). Torque (τ = r × F) is the rotational analogue of force and causes angular acceleration. Angular momentum (L = Iω) is the rotational analogue of linear momentum, and the relation τ = dL/dt is the rotational form of Newton's second law. Moment of inertia (I) measures resistance to angular acceleration and depends on mass distribution relative to the axis of rotation: I = MR² for a ring, ½MR² for a disc, (1/12)ML² for a rod about its centre, and (2/5)MR² for a solid sphere. The parallel axis theorem (I = I_cm + Md²) and perpendicular axis theorem (I_z = I_x + I_y for planar bodies) allow calculation of moment of inertia about any axis. The equations of rotational kinematics mirror their translational counterparts. Rolling without slipping combines translation and rotation with the constraint v = Rω. A rigid body is in equilibrium when both the net force and net torque about any point are zero.",

Using the equation ω = ω₀ + αt, where ω₀ is the initial angular velocity and ω is the final angular velocity (0 rad/s), the time taken to stop the disc is 10 rad/s / 2 rad/s² = 5 s.",

      "correct_answer": "3/2 MR²",
      "explanation_correct": "The moment of inertia of a disc about an axis tangential to its rim and perpendicular to its plane is 3/2 MR² because the mass is distributed farther from the axis compared to the disc's center of mass, increasing its resistance to angular acceleration.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 3/2 MR². This is because the moment of inertia formula for a disc about an axis through its center is 1/2 MR², but when the axis is tangential to the rim, the mass is farther from the axis, so the moment of inertia increases to 3/2 MR²."

      "correct_answer": "183.3",
      "explanation_correct": "The reaction at the left support is 183.3 N because the net force on the beam must be zero for it to be in equilibrium. The 200 N weight creates a downward force, balanced by an upward force from the left and right supports. The reaction at the left support can be calculated using the principle of moments about the right support.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is a decimal number with one decimal place, such as 183.3 N. An incorrect explanation might state that the reaction at the left support is 100 N, as this is the weight of the beam itself. However, this does not account for the additional 200 N weight placed on the beam, which creates an unbalanced force that must be supported by the left and right supports."

      "correct_answer": "0.5",
      "explanation_correct": "The moment of inertia of a disc about its center is given by I = (1/2)MR^2, where M is the mass of the disc and R is its radius. Given the angular momentum L = 30 kg·m²/s and the angular velocity ω = 60 rad/s, we can use the formula L = Iω to find the moment of inertia I = L/ω = 30 kg·m²/s / 60 rad/s = 0.5 kg·m².",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to assume that the moment of inertia is directly proportional to the angular momentum, which is not the case. The moment of inertia is a measure of the object's resistance to angular acceleration and depends on the mass distribution relative to the axis of rotation. For a disc, the moment of inertia is given by I = (1/2)MR^2, where M is the mass and R is the radius of the disc. The correct answer of 0.5 kg·m² can be calculated using the given information about the angular momentum and angular velocity."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct order from lowest to highest moment of inertia is: solid sphere (2/5 MR²), disc (1/2 MR²), hollow sphere (2/3 MR²), ring (MR²). This is because the moment of inertia depends on how the mass is distributed relative to the axis of rotation - objects with more mass farther from the axis will have higher moments of inertia."

      "explanation_incorrect": "One common mistake could be to arrange the masses in the order of their positions, i.e., 1 kg at 1 m, 2 kg at 3 m, 3 kg at 5 m.
