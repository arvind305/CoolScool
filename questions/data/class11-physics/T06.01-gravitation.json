    "text": "Newton's law of universal gravitation states that every two point masses attract each other with a force F = Gm₁m₂/r², where G = 6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ N·m²/kg² is the universal gravitational constant. The acceleration due to gravity at the Earth's surface is g = GM/R² ≈ 9.8 m/s². This value varies with altitude (g' = g(1 − 2h/R) for h << R), with depth (g' = g(1 − d/R)), and with latitude due to Earth's rotation. Gravitational potential energy for a mass m at distance r from the centre of the Earth is U = −GMm/r, taking zero at infinity. The escape velocity — the minimum speed needed to leave Earth's gravitational field — is vₑ = √(2gR) ≈ 11.2 km/s. The orbital velocity for a satellite in circular orbit at height h is v₀ = √(GM/(R+h)). Kepler's three laws describe planetary motion: planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus (law of orbits); the line joining a planet to the Sun sweeps equal areas in equal times (law of areas, implying conservation of angular momentum); and the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (T² ∝ r³). The total energy of an orbiting satellite is E = −GMm/(2r), which is negative indicating a bound system.",

Kepler's second law states that the planet moves fastest when it is closest to the Sun (at perihelion) and slowest when it is farthest from the Sun (at aphelion). This is because the gravitational force from the Sun is stronger at the perihelion, causing the planet to accelerate and move faster, while it is weaker at the aphelion, causing the planet to decelerate and move slower."

At a height of R/2 (half the Earth's radius), the acceleration due to gravity is approximately g' = g(1 - 2h/R) = g(1 - 1) = 0.5g, where g is the acceleration due to gravity at the Earth's surface.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format for this question is a single number, 24. The reason a geostationary satellite has a 24-hour period is that it orbits the Earth at an altitude where its orbital period matches the Earth's rotation period. This allows the satellite to remain fixed above the same point on the Earth's surface."

This is because the acceleration due to gravity (g) decreases with height above the Earth's surface, following the formula g' = g(1 - 2h/R), where h is the height and R is the Earth's radius. Since the height is equal to the Earth's radius (h = R), the formula simplifies to g' = g(1 - 2) = 0.5g, which is 2.5 m/s².",

The correct formula to use is g' = g(1 - 2h/R), where h is the height and R is the Earth's radius. Plugging in h = R, we get g' = g(1 - 2) = 0.5g, which is 2.5 m/s²."

The difference arises because at altitude, the entire Earth's mass is below you at increasing distance, while at depth, only the mass in the inner sphere of radius (R − d) contributes to the gravitational force, with the outer shell producing zero net force.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The variation of g with altitude and depth are fundamentally different. At altitude, g decreases as (1 − 2h/R) because the distance from Earth's center increases. At depth, g decreases as (1 − d/R) because only the mass inside the sphere of radius (R − d) contributes to gravity.

These satellites have a 24-hour orbital period matching Earth's rotation, orbit directly above the equator (equatorial plane), and appear stationary relative to a fixed point on Earth's surface. This makes them ideal for telecommunications and weather monitoring. Polar satellites orbit over the poles, GPS satellites have 12-hour periods, and ISS has a ~90-minute period and inclined orbit.",

The ISS orbits at low altitude with a period of about 90 minutes and an inclination of 51.6°, so it is not in the equatorial plane and is not stationary. Only geostationary satellites satisfy all three properties."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "There are two reasons g is less at the equator: (1) Earth's rotation creates a centrifugal effect at the equator (maximum rotational speed), effectively reducing the measured g by about 0.034 m/s²; (2) Earth is oblate (bulges at the equator), making the equatorial radius about 21 km larger than the polar radius, which reduces g by about 0.018 m/s² due to greater distance from Earth's center. Combined, these effects make g ≈ 9.78 m/s² at the equator vs. 9.83 m/s² at the poles.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The equator's distance from the Sun is irrelevant to g, which depends on Earth's mass and radius. Atmospheric thickness doesn't affect gravitational acceleration. The Moon's gravity affects tides but doesn't significantly reduce g at the equator specifically. The real reasons are Earth's rotation (centrifugal effect reduces effective g) and Earth's oblate shape (equator is farther from Earth's center). Both effects work together to make g measurably smaller at the equator."
