    "text": "Newton's law of universal gravitation states that every two point masses attract each other with a force F = Gm₁m₂/r², where G = 6.674 × 10⁻¹¹ N·m²/kg² is the universal gravitational constant. The acceleration due to gravity at the Earth's surface is g = GM/R² ≈ 9.8 m/s². This value varies with altitude (g' = g(1 − 2h/R) for h << R), with depth (g' = g(1 − d/R)), and with latitude due to Earth's rotation. Gravitational potential energy for a mass m at distance r from the centre of the Earth is U = −GMm/r, taking zero at infinity. The escape velocity — the minimum speed needed to leave Earth's gravitational field — is vₑ = √(2gR) ≈ 11.2 km/s. The orbital velocity for a satellite in circular orbit at height h is v₀ = √(GM/(R+h)). Kepler's three laws describe planetary motion: planets move in elliptical orbits with the Sun at one focus (law of orbits); the line joining a planet to the Sun sweeps equal areas in equal times (law of areas, implying conservation of angular momentum); and the square of the orbital period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (T² ∝ r³). The total energy of an orbiting satellite is E = −GMm/(2r), which is negative indicating a bound system.",

Kepler's second law states that the planet moves fastest when it is closest to the Sun (at perihelion) and slowest when it is farthest from the Sun (at aphelion). This is because the gravitational force from the Sun is stronger at the perihelion, causing the planet to accelerate and move faster, while it is weaker at the aphelion, causing the planet to decelerate and move slower."

At a height of R/2 (half the Earth's radius), the acceleration due to gravity is approximately g' = g(1 - 2h/R) = g(1 - 1) = 0.5g, where g is the acceleration due to gravity at the Earth's surface.

      "question_text": "A geostationary satellite has a time period of ___ hours.",
      "correct_answer": "24",
      "explanation_correct": "A geostationary satellite has an orbital period of exactly 24 hours, which is the same as the rotation period of the Earth. This means the satellite appears to be stationary relative to a fixed point on the Earth's surface.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format for this question is a single number, 24. The reason a geostationary satellite has a 24-hour period is that it orbits the Earth at an altitude where its orbital period matches the Earth's rotation period. This allows the satellite to remain fixed above the same point on the Earth's surface."

      "correct_answer": "−2",
      "explanation_correct": "The ratio of potential energy (PE) to kinetic energy (KE) for a satellite in a circular orbit is -2. This is because the total energy of the satellite is equal to the sum of its PE and KE, and the total energy is negative, indicating a bound system. The relationship between PE and KE for a circular orbit is given by E = PE + KE = -GMm/(2r), where the PE is -GMm/r and the KE is GMm/(2r), resulting in a ratio of -2.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be any value other than -2. For example, if a student wrote -1 as the ratio of PE to KE, it would be incorrect because the total energy of the satellite in a circular orbit is negative, and the relationship between PE and KE is given by the formula E = PE + KE = -GMm/(2r), which results in a ratio of -2."

      "correct_answer": "2.5",
      "explanation_correct": "The correct answer is 2.5 m/s². This is because the acceleration due to gravity (g) decreases with height above the Earth's surface, following the formula g' = g(1 - 2h/R), where h is the height and R is the Earth's radius. Since the height is equal to the Earth's radius (h = R), the formula simplifies to g' = g(1 - 2) = 0.5g, which is 2.5 m/s².",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be 10 m/s². This is because the acceleration due to gravity (g) is often given as approximately 10 m/s² at the Earth's surface. However, this value of g is only valid at the surface, and it decreases with increasing height above the surface. The correct formula to use is g' = g(1 - 2h/R), where h is the height and R is the Earth's radius. Plugging in h = R, we get g' = g(1 - 2) = 0.5g, which is 2.5 m/s²."

      "explanation_correct": "If both the mass and radius of a planet are twice that of Earth, the acceleration due to gravity on its surface is 0.5 times the acceleration due to gravity on Earth's surface. This is because the acceleration due to gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the planet's radius, so if the radius is doubled, the acceleration due to gravity is reduced by a factor of 4, or 0.5 times the original value.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to say that the acceleration due to gravity on the surface of the planet is 2 times the acceleration due to gravity on Earth's surface. This is wrong because the acceleration due to gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the planet's radius, not directly proportional. Since the radius of the planet is twice that of Earth, the acceleration due to gravity would be 0.5 times the acceleration due to gravity on Earth's surface."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to place the orbital velocity before the speed after falling from height R.
