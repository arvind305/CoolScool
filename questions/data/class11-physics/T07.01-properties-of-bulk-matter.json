    "text": "Properties of bulk matter encompass elasticity, fluid statics, fluid dynamics, surface tension and viscosity. Elasticity describes a material's ability to regain its shape after deformation: stress (force per unit area, in N/m² or Pa) and strain (fractional deformation, dimensionless) are related by Hooke's law within the elastic limit. Young's modulus (Y = tensile stress/longitudinal strain), bulk modulus (K = volume stress/volume strain) and modulus of rigidity (G = shear stress/shear strain) characterise different types of deformation. In fluid statics, pressure at depth h in a fluid is P = P₀ + ρgh; Pascal's law states that pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted equally in all directions (basis of hydraulic machines); and Archimedes' principle states that the buoyant force equals the weight of fluid displaced. Fluid dynamics introduces the equation of continuity (A₁v₁ = A₂v₂ for incompressible fluids) and Bernoulli's theorem (P + ½ρv² + ρgh = constant along a streamline). Surface tension (S) is the force per unit length along the surface of a liquid; it causes capillary rise h = 2S cos θ/(rρg) and excess pressure inside a soap bubble ΔP = 4S/r. Viscosity is the internal friction in fluids; the coefficient of viscosity η appears in Stokes' law F = 6πηrv for a sphere moving through a viscous fluid, leading to terminal velocity when the drag force balances the net gravitational force.",

Since the cross-section area has decreased from 20 cm² to 10 cm², the velocity must increase by a factor of 2 to maintain the same volume flow rate.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is a single number, but the incorrect answer would be 2 m/s. This is wrong because the equation of continuity states that as the cross-sectional area decreases, the velocity must increase to maintain the same volume flow rate. Since the area has decreased by a factor of 2, the velocity must increase by a factor of 2 to 4 m/s."

      "correct_answer": "1.885 × 10⁻³",
      "explanation_correct": "The correct answer is 1.885 × 10⁻³ N, as calculated using Stokes' law F = 6πηrv, where η is the viscosity, r is the radius of the sphere, and v is the velocity. Plugging in the given values of η = 0.5 Pa⋅s, r = 2 mm = 0.002 m, and v = 0.1 m/s, we get F = 6π × 0.5 × 0.002 × 0.1 = 1.885 × 10⁻³ N.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be a value other than 1.885 × 10⁻³ N. This could happen if the formula for Stokes' law was not applied correctly, or if the given values were misinterpreted or calculated incorrectly. The key is to remember the Stokes' law formula F = 6πηrv and plug in the values provided in the question to get the exact answer of 1.885 × 10⁻³ N."

      "correct_answer": "0.5",
      "explanation_correct": "The extension is 0.5 mm because Hooke's law states that the stress (force per unit area) is proportional to the strain (fractional deformation). Using the given values of Young's modulus, force, and cross-sectional area, we can calculate the extension using the formula: extension = (force × length) / (Young's modulus × cross-sectional area).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The extension is not 0.75 mm. The correct answer is 0.5 mm, calculated using the formula: extension = (force × length) / (Young's modulus × cross-sectional area). The extension depends on the force applied, the length of the wire, the cross-sectional area, and the Young's modulus of the material. Plugging in the given values, the extension comes out to be 0.5 mm."

      "explanation_correct": "The fraction of the body's volume above the water surface is 0.2, or 20%. This is because the buoyant force on the body is equal to the weight of the fluid (water) displaced, which is 80% of the body's total volume. Therefore, the remaining 20% of the body's volume is above the water surface.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 0.2. The correct explanation is that since the body's density is 800 kg/m³ and water's density is 1000 kg/m³, the body will float with 20% of its volume above the water surface. This is because the buoyant force on the body is equal to the weight of the fluid (water) displaced, which is 80% of the body's total volume. Therefore, the remaining 20% of the body's volume is above the water surface."
