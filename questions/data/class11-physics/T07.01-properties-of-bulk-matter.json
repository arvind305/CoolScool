    "text": "Properties of bulk matter encompass elasticity, fluid statics, fluid dynamics, surface tension and viscosity. Elasticity describes a material's ability to regain its shape after deformation: stress (force per unit area, in N/m² or Pa) and strain (fractional deformation, dimensionless) are related by Hooke's law within the elastic limit. Young's modulus (Y = tensile stress/longitudinal strain), bulk modulus (K = volume stress/volume strain) and modulus of rigidity (G = shear stress/shear strain) characterise different types of deformation. In fluid statics, pressure at depth h in a fluid is P = P₀ + ρgh; Pascal's law states that pressure applied to an enclosed fluid is transmitted equally in all directions (basis of hydraulic machines); and Archimedes' principle states that the buoyant force equals the weight of fluid displaced. Fluid dynamics introduces the equation of continuity (A₁v₁ = A₂v₂ for incompressible fluids) and Bernoulli's theorem (P + ½ρv² + ρgh = constant along a streamline). Surface tension (S) is the force per unit length along the surface of a liquid; it causes capillary rise h = 2S cos θ/(rρg) and excess pressure inside a soap bubble ΔP = 4S/r. Viscosity is the internal friction in fluids; the coefficient of viscosity η appears in Stokes' law F = 6πηrv for a sphere moving through a viscous fluid, leading to terminal velocity when the drag force balances the net gravitational force.",
