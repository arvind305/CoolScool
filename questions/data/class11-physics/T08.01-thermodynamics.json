    "text": "Thermodynamics deals with the relationship between heat, work and internal energy. The zeroth law establishes thermal equilibrium as the basis for temperature measurement. The first law of thermodynamics (ΔU = Q − W) states that the change in internal energy of a system equals the heat added minus the work done by the system. For an ideal gas, work done in various processes differs: in an isothermal process (constant T), W = nRT ln(V₂/V₁); in an isobaric process (constant P), W = PΔV; in an isochoric process (constant V), W = 0; and in an adiabatic process (Q = 0), PV^γ = constant. The specific heat capacities at constant pressure (Cₚ) and constant volume (Cᵥ) are related by Cₚ − Cᵥ = R for an ideal gas. Heat engines convert heat into work, with the Carnot engine achieving maximum efficiency η = 1 − T₂/T₁ between temperatures T₁ (hot) and T₂ (cold). Refrigerators transfer heat from cold to hot reservoirs, characterised by the coefficient of performance COP = Q₂/W. The second law of thermodynamics (Kelvin-Planck: no engine can convert heat entirely to work; Clausius: heat cannot spontaneously flow from cold to hot) introduces the concept of entropy, a measure of disorder that always increases for irreversible processes. Heat transfer occurs by conduction (Q/t = kAΔT/Δx), convection (bulk fluid motion) and radiation (Stefan's law: E = σT⁴, where σ = 5.67 × 10⁻⁸ W/m²·K⁴).",

Rohan's engine achieves 40%, which is less than this theoretical maximum. No real heat engine can exceed or even reach Carnot efficiency due to irreversibilities like friction, heat losses, and non-quasi-static processes.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "It is impossible for any real heat engine to exceed the Carnot efficiency, which represents the theoretical maximum. The Carnot efficiency depends only on the temperatures of the reservoirs and is independent of the working substance.

The fire emits electromagnetic radiation (infrared waves) according to Stefan's law (E = σT⁴), which travels through the air (and even through vacuum) and is absorbed by her skin, making her feel warm.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Conduction requires direct physical contact, which is not the case here. While some natural convection might occur, the problem states there is no wind, and more importantly, she feels the warmth directly on her face facing the fire. This is characteristic of radiant heat transfer, where infrared radiation from the hot fire travels through space to her skin."

The cumulative effect of all these factors results in total radiated power being proportional to T⁴, not T.",
