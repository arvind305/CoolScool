    "text": "The kinetic theory of gases models a gas as a large number of identical molecules in random motion, interacting through perfectly elastic collisions. The ideal gas equation PV = nRT (where n is the number of moles, R = 8.314 J/mol·K) unifies Boyle's law (PV = constant at constant T), Charles's law (V/T = constant at constant P) and Gay-Lussac's law (P/T = constant at constant V). From kinetic theory, the pressure exerted by an ideal gas is P = (1/3)ρv²_rms, where v_rms = √(3RT/M) is the root-mean-square speed and M is the molar mass. The kinetic energy per molecule is (3/2)kT, where k = R/Nₐ = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K is Boltzmann's constant, establishing a direct proportionality between molecular kinetic energy and absolute temperature. The law of equipartition of energy assigns (1/2)kT of energy to each degree of freedom: monoatomic gases have 3 translational degrees of freedom, diatomic gases at moderate temperatures have 5 (3 translational + 2 rotational), giving γ = 5/3 and 7/5 respectively. The three molecular speeds — RMS speed (v_rms = √(3RT/M)), mean speed (v_mean = √(8RT/πM)) and most probable speed (v_mp = √(2RT/M)) — are in the ratio v_mp : v_mean : v_rms = 1 : 1.128 : 1.225. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between successive collisions.",

      "correct_answer": "7/2",
      "explanation_correct": "For a diatomic ideal gas, the number of degrees of freedom is 5 (3 translational + 2 rotational). According to the law of equipartition of energy, each degree of freedom gets (1/2)kT of energy. Therefore, the molar specific heat capacity Cp = (5/2)R for a diatomic ideal gas.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be Cp = 3/2 R per mole. This is because a monoatomic ideal gas has 3 degrees of freedom (only translational), so each degree of freedom gets (1/2)kT of energy, resulting in Cp = 3/2 R. However, for a diatomic ideal gas, the correct answer is Cp = 7/2 R per mole, as it has 5 degrees of freedom (3 translational + 2 rotational)."

      "explanation_correct": "The most probable speed of gas molecules is given by the formula v_mp = √(2RT/M), where R is the universal gas constant, T is the absolute temperature, and M is the molar mass of the gas. For oxygen (M = 32 g/mol) at 300 K, plugging in the values gives v_mp ≈ 395 m/s, which is the correct answer.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to use a different formula for the speed of gas molecules, such as the root-mean-square (RMS) speed v_rms = √(3RT/M) or the mean speed v_mean = √(8RT/πM). However, the most probable speed v_mp is the correct formula to use in this case, and for oxygen at 300 K, the value of v_mp is approximately 395 m/s."

This is because the Boltzmann constant k is related to the universal gas constant R by the formula k = R/N_a, not k = R * N_a.

Rearranging this formula, we get v_rms = √(3P/ρ), where P is the pressure and ρ is the density of the gas. Plugging in the given values of P = 3 × 10⁵ Pa and ρ = 2 kg/m³, we get v_rms = √(4.5 × 10⁵) ≈ 671 m/s.",
