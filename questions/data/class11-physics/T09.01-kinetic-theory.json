    "text": "The kinetic theory of gases models a gas as a large number of identical molecules in random motion, interacting through perfectly elastic collisions. The ideal gas equation PV = nRT (where n is the number of moles, R = 8.314 J/mol·K) unifies Boyle's law (PV = constant at constant T), Charles's law (V/T = constant at constant P) and Gay-Lussac's law (P/T = constant at constant V). From kinetic theory, the pressure exerted by an ideal gas is P = (1/3)ρv²_rms, where v_rms = √(3RT/M) is the root-mean-square speed and M is the molar mass. The kinetic energy per molecule is (3/2)kT, where k = R/Nₐ = 1.38 × 10⁻²³ J/K is Boltzmann's constant, establishing a direct proportionality between molecular kinetic energy and absolute temperature. The law of equipartition of energy assigns (1/2)kT of energy to each degree of freedom: monoatomic gases have 3 translational degrees of freedom, diatomic gases at moderate temperatures have 5 (3 translational + 2 rotational), giving γ = 5/3 and 7/5 respectively. The three molecular speeds — RMS speed (v_rms = √(3RT/M)), mean speed (v_mean = √(8RT/πM)) and most probable speed (v_mp = √(2RT/M)) — are in the ratio v_mp : v_mean : v_rms = 1 : 1.128 : 1.225. The mean free path is the average distance a molecule travels between successive collisions.",
