    "text": "Oscillatory motion is a periodic back-and-forth motion about an equilibrium position. Simple harmonic motion (SHM) is the simplest form, in which the restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement and directed towards the equilibrium (F = −kx). The displacement in SHM is x = A sin(ωt + φ), where A is amplitude, ω = 2π/T is angular frequency, and φ is the initial phase. The velocity v = Aω cos(ωt + φ) is maximum at the equilibrium and zero at the extremes; the acceleration a = −ω²x is maximum at the extremes and zero at the equilibrium. The total energy E = ½mω²A² is constant: it oscillates between kinetic energy KE = ½mω²(A² − x²) and potential energy PE = ½mω²x². The simple pendulum (T = 2π√(l/g)) and spring-mass system (T = 2π√(m/k)) are the two most common SHM systems. Springs in series (1/k_eff = 1/k₁ + 1/k₂) and parallel (k_eff = k₁ + k₂) allow calculation of effective spring constants. Damped oscillations involve energy loss (typically through friction or viscosity), causing amplitude to decrease over time. Forced oscillations occur when an external periodic force drives the system; when the driving frequency matches the natural frequency, resonance occurs and the amplitude reaches a maximum.",

      "explanation_correct": "The kinetic energy in simple harmonic motion is given by the formula KE = 1/2 * m * (Aω)^2 * (1 - (x/A)^2), where A is the amplitude, ω is the angular frequency, and x is the displacement. Since the kinetic energy is maximum when x = 0 (at the equilibrium position), the order of increasing kinetic energy is: x = A, x = A/√2, x = A/2, x = 0.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect explanation would be that the kinetic energy is maximum when the displacement is maximum (x = A). This is not correct because the kinetic energy is actually maximum when the displacement is zero (x = 0), as the formula shows. The order of increasing kinetic energy is: x = A, x = A/√2, x = A/2, x = 0."

      "explanation_correct": "The effective spring constant increases when springs are arranged in parallel, but decreases when arranged in series. So the order from lowest to highest effective spring constant is: two springs k in series, single spring k, two springs k in parallel, three springs k in parallel.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The reason the order is incorrect is that when springs are arranged in parallel, the effective spring constant increases, but when arranged in series, the effective spring constant decreases. So the correct order from lowest to highest effective spring constant is: two springs k in series, single spring k, two springs k in parallel, three springs k in parallel."

The velocity is non-zero, so the kinetic energy is also non-zero. Therefore, the correct order from minimum to maximum is: Displacement, Potential energy, Velocity, Kinetic energy.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "A common misconception is that the quantities would be in the order: Displacement, Velocity, Potential energy, Kinetic energy. However, this is incorrect because at the mean position, the displacement is zero but the velocity is non-zero, so the kinetic energy is greater than the potential energy. The correct order is: Displacement, Potential energy, Velocity, Kinetic energy."
