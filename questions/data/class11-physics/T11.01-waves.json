    "text": "A wave is a disturbance that transfers energy from one point to another without the transfer of matter. Waves are classified as transverse (particle displacement perpendicular to wave propagation, e.g., waves on a string, light) or longitudinal (particle displacement along propagation, e.g., sound waves). A progressive wave is described by y = A sin(kx − ωt), where A is amplitude, k = 2π/λ is the wave number, ω = 2πf is angular frequency, and the wave speed v = fλ = ω/k. The superposition principle states that when two or more waves overlap, the resultant displacement is the algebraic sum of individual displacements. Interference occurs when two waves of similar frequency overlap: constructive interference when they are in phase and destructive when out of phase. Standing waves form when two identical waves travel in opposite directions, creating nodes (zero displacement) and antinodes (maximum displacement). The speed of sound in a gas is v = √(γP/ρ), and increases with temperature. Vibrations of strings produce harmonics with frequencies fₙ = n/(2L)√(T/μ); open pipes produce all harmonics fₙ = nv/(2L) while closed pipes produce only odd harmonics fₙ = nv/(4L) (n = 1, 3, 5...). Beats occur when two waves of slightly different frequencies interfere, producing a periodic variation in loudness with beat frequency f_beat = |f₁ − f₂|. The Doppler effect describes the apparent change in frequency when source or observer moves relative to the medium.",
