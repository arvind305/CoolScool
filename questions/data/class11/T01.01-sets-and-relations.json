    "text": "A set is a well-defined collection of distinct objects called elements. Sets can be represented in roster form by listing elements within braces, or in set-builder form by stating a property that characterises the elements. Operations on sets such as union (∪), intersection (∩), difference, and complement allow us to combine or compare sets. The Cartesian product A × B of two sets produces ordered pairs, and a relation from A to B is any subset of A × B. Venn diagrams provide a visual tool for understanding set operations and verifying algebraic laws such as De Morgan's laws.",

      "explanation_correct": "The set {x : x ∈ ℤ and −2 ≤ x < 3} describes all the integers (whole numbers) between -2 and 3, not including 3. So the roster form of this set is {-2, -1, 0, 1, 2}.",

The incorrect answer might be {-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3}, which includes integers outside the range of -2 to less than 3. The correct set only includes the integers -2, -1, 0, 1, and 2, as they are the only whole numbers that satisfy the given condition."

A - B has a larger cardinality because it includes the elements in A that are not in B. A' has an even larger cardinality since it includes all elements in the universal set U that are not in A. Finally, A ∪ B has the largest cardinality as it includes all the unique elements from both sets.",
