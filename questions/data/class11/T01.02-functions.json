    "text": "A function f from set A to set B is a special relation that assigns to each element of A exactly one element of B. The set A is the domain, B is the co-domain, and the set of all images is the range. Functions are classified as one-one (injective) if distinct inputs give distinct outputs, onto (surjective) if every element of B is an image, and bijective if both. Real-valued functions include polynomial, rational, modulus, signum, and greatest integer functions, and algebra of functions allows combining them through addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.",

      "question_text": "The total number of functions from a set with 2 elements to a set with 3 elements is ___.",
      "correct_answer": "9",
      "explanation_correct": "The total number of functions from a set with 2 elements to a set with 3 elements is 9. This is because for each element in the set of 2 elements, there are 3 possible choices in the set of 3 elements. Since each element in the first set must be mapped to exactly one element in the second set, the total number of possible functions is 3 x 3 = 9.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 9. Some students may think the total number of functions is the sum of the elements in the two sets, which would be 2 + 3 = 5. However, this is incorrect because the question asks for the total number of functions, not the sum of the elements in the sets. The correct way to calculate the total number of functions is to multiply the number of choices for each element in the first set, which is 3 choices for each of the 2 elements, resulting in 3 x 3 = 9 possible functions."
