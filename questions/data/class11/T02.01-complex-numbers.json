    "text": "Complex numbers extend the real number system by introducing the imaginary unit i where i² = −1. Every complex number can be written in the standard form z = a + ib, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part. Arithmetic operations on complex numbers follow the usual algebraic rules with the additional rule that i² = −1. The modulus |z| = √(a² + b²) gives the distance from the origin in the Argand plane, and the conjugate z̄ = a − ib is the reflection across the real axis. Complex numbers can also be expressed in polar form z = r(cos θ + i sin θ).",

The modulus of a complex number z = a + bi is given by |z| = √(a² + b²). Applying this formula, we get |1 + i| = √2, |2| = 2, |3 + 4i| = 5, and |5i| = 5. Therefore, the correct order from smallest to largest modulus is B, C, A, D.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect explanation would be to arrange the complex numbers based on the real part or the imaginary part alone, without considering the modulus. For example, arranging them in increasing order of the real part would give C, B, A, D, which is not the correct order. The key is to calculate the modulus of each complex number and then arrange them in increasing order of the modulus."
