      "correct_answer": "2 ± 3i",
      "explanation_correct": "The roots of the quadratic equation x² - 4x + 13 = 0 are 2 ± 3i because the discriminant D = b² - 4ac = (-4)² - 4(1)(13) = 16 - 52 = -36, which is less than 0. This means the roots are complex conjugate pairs, with the real part being -b/2a = -(-4)/2(1) = 2 and the imaginary part being ±√(-36)/2(1) = ±3i.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be 2 ± √13, which is wrong because the discriminant D = b² - 4ac = (-4)² - 4(1)(13) = 16 - 52 = -36, which is less than 0. This means the roots are complex conjugate pairs, not real and distinct. The correct answer is 2 ± 3i, where the real part is 2 and the imaginary part is ±3i."

      "correct_answer": "26",
      "explanation_correct": "The correct answer is 26 because the sum of the squares of the roots (α² + β²) is equal to the coefficient of the constant term in the quadratic equation (c/a = 5/1 = 5), plus the square of the coefficient of the linear term (b²/a² = 6²/1² = 36), which equals 5 + 21 = 26.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to add the roots α and β directly, which would give α + β = -6. However, the question asks for the sum of the squares of the roots, which is a different calculation. The correct answer is 26, obtained by adding the square of the constant term coefficient (5) and the square of the linear term coefficient (6²) as per the formula."

      "correct_answer": "13",
      "explanation_correct": "If one root of a quadratic equation is 2 - 3i, then the other root must be its complex conjugate, which is 2 + 3i. The product of the two roots is (2 - 3i)(2 + 3i) = 4 + 9 = 13.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is a single number, 13. If the roots of the quadratic equation are α = 2 - 3i and β = 2 + 3i, then the product of the roots is αβ = (2 - 3i)(2 + 3i) = 4 + 9 = 13. This is because the complex conjugate roots have a product that is the sum of their squares."
