    "text": "A linear inequality is a mathematical statement that relates a linear expression to another using inequality signs (<, >, ≤, ≥). In one variable, solving involves isolating the variable while remembering that multiplying or dividing by a negative number reverses the inequality sign. The solution set can be represented on a number line. Systems of linear inequalities in one variable require finding the intersection of individual solution sets. In two variables, the solution is a region in the Cartesian plane, determined by graphing the boundary line and shading the appropriate half-plane.",

      "For two-variable inequalities, the boundary line ax + by = c divides the plane into two half-planes.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be A, B, C, D. This is wrong because you cannot shade the region before drawing the boundary line. You need to first plot the y-intercept at (0, -1), then draw the line y = 2x - 1, test a point to determine the correct shaded region, and finally shade the region above the line including the line itself."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect explanation would be to arrange the intervals based on the numerical values of the endpoints rather than the length of the intervals. This would result in the order: (B) (0, 1), (A) [-1, 2], (D) [2, 7], (C) [-3, 5]. However, the correct order is based on the length of the intervals, not the specific numerical values."
