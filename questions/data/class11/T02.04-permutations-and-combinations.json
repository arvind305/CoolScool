    "text": "Permutations deal with the arrangement of objects where order matters, while combinations deal with the selection of objects where order does not matter. The fundamental principle of counting states that if one task can be done in m ways and another in n ways, then both tasks together can be done in m × n ways (multiplication principle). A permutation of n objects taken r at a time is given by nPr = n!/(n−r)!, while a combination is given by nCr = n!/[r!(n−r)!]. Circular permutations of n objects equal (n−1)!, and permutations with repeated objects use the formula n!/(p!q!r!...).",

      "correct_answer": "60",
      "explanation_correct": "The number of ways to choose 2 boys and 2 girls from 5 boys and 4 girls is 60. This is because there are 5 boys and 4 girls, and we need to choose 2 boys and 2 girls. Using the combination formula, nCr = n!/[r!(n-r)!], we get 5C2 * 4C2 = 10 * 15 = 60 ways to choose 2 boys and 2 girls.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer could be 120. This is because one might think that the number of ways to choose 2 boys and 2 girls is the same as the number of permutations of 2 boys and 2 girls, which would be 4! = 24. However, this is not correct, as the order of selection does not matter in combinations, so the correct answer is 60 ways."
