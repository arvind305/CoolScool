      "question_text": "The coefficient of x³ in (2 − x)⁵ is ___.",
      "correct_answer": "−40",
      "explanation_correct": "The coefficient of x³ in (2 - x)⁵ is -40 because the general term for the binomial expansion is ⁿCᵣ aⁿ⁻ʳ bʳ. In this case, n = 5, r = 3, a = 2, and b = -1. Plugging these values, we get 5C3 * 2⁵⁻³ * (-1)³ = -40.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to assume that the coefficient is simply the binomial coefficient 5C3 = 10. However, the binomial expansion also requires us to multiply the coefficient by the appropriate powers of a and b. In this case, the correct coefficient is -40, not 10."
