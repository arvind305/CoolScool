A geometric progression (GP) has a constant common ratio r, with nth term aₙ = arⁿ⁻¹ and sum Sₙ = a(rⁿ − 1)/(r − 1) for r ≠ 1. When |r| < 1, the sum to infinity converges to a/(1 − r).

      "explanation_correct": "The sum 1² + 2² + 3² + ... + 10² is an arithmetic progression (AP) with the first term a = 1² = 1 and common difference d = 2² - 1² = 3. Using the formula for the sum of an AP, Sn = n/2[2a + (n-1)d], we get S10 = 10/2[2(1) + (10-1)(3)] = 385.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is a single number, 385. One common mistake could be to calculate the sum incorrectly. For example, by adding the squares of the numbers 1 to 10 without using the AP formula, the sum would be 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 + 25 + 36 + 49 + 64 + 81 + 100 = 385, which is the correct answer."

      "explanation_correct": "The given geometric progression (GP) has a common ratio of 2, with the first term as 1. Using the formula for the sum of the first n terms of a GP, S₈ = 1(2⁸ - 1)/(2 - 1) = 255, which is the correct answer.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer could be obtained by mistakenly thinking the sum of a GP follows the formula for an arithmetic progression (AP), which is not the case. The correct formula to use for the sum of the first n terms of a GP is S₈ = a(r⁸ - 1)/(r - 1), where a is the first term and r is the common ratio. Plugging in the values given, we get the correct answer of 255."

      "explanation_correct": "If the arithmetic mean (AM) of two positive numbers is 10 and the geometric mean (GM) is 8, then the numbers must be 4 and 16. This is because the formula for AM is (a + b)/2 = 10, and the formula for GM is √(ab) = 8. Solving these equations gives the values of a = 4 and b = 16.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be something like 6 and 14. This is because the arithmetic mean (AM) of two numbers is the average of the two numbers, which is 10 in this case. However, the geometric mean (GM) is the square root of the product of the two numbers, which is 8 in this case. The correct numbers that satisfy both the AM = 10 and GM = 8 conditions are 4 and 16."
