    "text": "Mathematical induction is a method of proof used to establish that a statement P(n) is true for all natural numbers n ≥ 1. The proof has two steps: (1) Base case: verify P(1) is true, (2) Inductive step: assume P(k) is true for some arbitrary natural number k (inductive hypothesis), then prove that P(k+1) must also be true. If both steps are completed, then P(n) is true for all natural numbers. This method is commonly used to prove summation formulae, divisibility results, and inequalities.",
    "rules": [
      "Step 1 (Base case): Verify P(1) is true.",
      "Step 2 (Inductive hypothesis): Assume P(k) is true for some k ≥ 1.",
      "Step 3 (Inductive step): Prove P(k+1) using the assumption P(k).",
      "Both the base case and inductive step are necessary for a valid proof.",
      "The method works because it creates a chain: P(1) → P(2) → P(3) → ... for all n."
