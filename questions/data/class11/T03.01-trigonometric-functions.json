    "text": "Trigonometric functions extend the ratios of right triangles to any angle using the unit circle. Angles can be measured in degrees or radians, with π radians = 180°. The six trigonometric functions have specific signs in each quadrant (ASTC rule). Compound angle formulae such as sin(A ± B) and cos(A ± B) allow computation of trigonometric values of sums and differences of angles. Double angle formulae like sin 2A = 2 sin A cos A and cos 2A = cos²A − sin²A are derived from compound angle formulae and are widely used in simplification and solving equations.",
