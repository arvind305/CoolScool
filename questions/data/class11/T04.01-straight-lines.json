The slope m measures the steepness of the line. The angle θ between two lines with slopes m₁ and m₂ satisfies tan θ = |m₁ − m₂|/(1 + m₁m₂). The perpendicular distance from a point (x₁, y₁) to the line ax + by + c = 0 is |ax₁ + by₁ + c|/√(a² + b²). The family of lines through the intersection of two lines L₁ and L₂ is given by L₁ + λL₂ = 0.",

      "correct_answer": "3, 1",
      "explanation_correct": "The point of intersection of the lines x + y = 4 and x - y = 2 is (3, 1) because when you solve the two linear equations simultaneously, you get x = 3 and y = 1 as the unique solution.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is (3, 1). To find the point of intersection, you need to solve the two linear equations x + y = 4 and x - y = 2 simultaneously. This can be done by substituting one equation into the other and solving for the variables x and y. The accepted answer format is (x, y), so the final answer is (3, 1)."

      "explanation_correct": "The general equation ax + by + c = 0 represents a line parallel to the y-axis when the coefficient of x, 'a', is 0. This is because when a = 0, the equation simplifies to y = -c/b, which is the equation of a vertical line (parallel to the y-axis).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 0. When b = 0 in the general equation ax + by + c = 0, the equation simplifies to ax + c = 0, which represents a horizontal line (parallel to the x-axis), not a vertical line. The coefficient b must be 0 for the line to be parallel to the y-axis."
