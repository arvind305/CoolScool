      "correct_answer": "4/5",
      "explanation_correct": "The eccentricity of an ellipse is given by the formula e = c/a, where c is the distance from the center to the focus, and a is the semi-major axis length. In the equation x²/25 + y²/9 = 1, we have a = 5 and b = 3, so c² = a² - b² = 25 - 9 = 16, and c = 4. Therefore, the eccentricity e = c/a = 4/5.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to say the eccentricity is 1. This is because the eccentricity of a circle is 0, and the eccentricity of a hyperbola is greater than 1. However, the given equation x²/25 + y²/9 = 1 represents an ellipse, not a circle or a hyperbola. The correct eccentricity for this ellipse is 4/5, as calculated in the correct explanation."

The eccentricity represents how much the curve deviates from a circle, with a higher eccentricity indicating a more elongated shape.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be A, B, C, D. This is because the eccentricity of a circle (A) is 0, which is the lowest. However, the order of a parabola (B), ellipse (C), and hyperbola (D) is not correct. A parabola has an eccentricity of 1, an ellipse has an eccentricity less than 1, and a hyperbola has an eccentricity greater than 1. So the correct order should be A, C, B, D."
