    "text": "The concept of a limit describes the value a function approaches as the input approaches a certain point. A limit lim(x→a) f(x) exists when both the left-hand limit and right-hand limit exist and are equal. Standard limits like lim(x→0) sin(x)/x = 1 and lim(x→a) (xⁿ − aⁿ)/(x − a) = naⁿ⁻¹ are fundamental results. The derivative f'(x) = lim(h→0) [f(x+h) − f(x)]/h represents the instantaneous rate of change. Derivatives follow rules including the sum, difference, product, and quotient rules.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be A, B, D, C. This is incorrect because it does not follow the proper sequence - the derivative formula should be stated first (C), then the change in the function calculated (B), followed by dividing by the change in the input variable (D), and finally simplifying to get the final derivative expression (A). The steps must be in the correct order to properly derive the derivative from first principles."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order of the limit values is B, C, A, D. This is because as the argument of the sine function approaches 0, the value of the sine function approaches the value of the argument. So the limit values increase in the order of the coefficients of x in the argument of the sine function.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to arrange the limit values as A, B, C, D. This is because the limit values do not increase in the order of the coefficients of x in the argument of the sine function. The correct order is B, C, A, D, which reflects the increasing values of the coefficients 1, 1/2, 2, 3."
