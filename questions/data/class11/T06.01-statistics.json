    "text": "Statistics involves the collection, analysis, and interpretation of data. Measures of dispersion describe the spread of data around a central value. Range is the simplest measure (maximum minus minimum). Mean deviation about the mean or median measures the average absolute difference from the central value. Variance σ² = (1/n)Σ(xᵢ − x̄)² and standard deviation σ = √(variance) quantify the spread more precisely. The coefficient of variation (CV = σ/x̄ × 100) enables comparison of variability between datasets with different means or units.",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is D, A, C, B because the coefficient of variation (CV) is directly proportional to the standard deviation (σ) and inversely proportional to the mean (x̄). So, the data set with the lowest CV is D, followed by A, C, and B in increasing order of CV.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect explanation may be that the order is based on the standard deviation (σ) alone. However, the CV takes into account both the mean (x̄) and the standard deviation, so it provides a more accurate measure of the variability of the data set. The correct order is determined by calculating the CV for each data set and arranging them in increasing order."
