      "correct_answer": "1/2",
      "explanation_correct": "Since A and B are mutually exclusive, the probability of their union is the sum of their individual probabilities. With P(A) = 1/3 and P(B) = 1/6, the probability of A or B occurring is P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) = 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is a decimal number. The correct answer is 1/2, which is 0.5. If A and B were not mutually exclusive, the probability of their union would be P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B). However, since A and B are mutually exclusive, there is no overlap between them, so P(A ∩ B) = 0. Therefore, the probability of A or B occurring is simply the sum of their individual probabilities, which is 1/2."

      "explanation_correct": "The sample space size increases from tossing 1 coin (2 outcomes), to rolling 1 die (6 outcomes), to tossing 3 coins (8 outcomes), to rolling 2 dice (36 outcomes). This is because each additional coin or die added increases the number of possible outcomes exponentially.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect explanation would be that the sample space size increases linearly with the number of trials. For example, tossing 3 coins does not have 3 times the number of outcomes as tossing 1 coin. Instead, the number of outcomes increases exponentially with each additional coin or die added to the experiment."
