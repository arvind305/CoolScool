  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Reproduction is the biological process by which organisms produce offspring, ensuring the continuity of species. It can be broadly classified into asexual reproduction, which involves a single parent and produces genetically identical offspring through mechanisms like binary fission, budding, sporulation, fragmentation, and vegetative propagation, and sexual reproduction, which involves the fusion of male and female gametes (syngamy) to produce genetically diverse offspring. Sexual reproduction follows a sequence of events: pre-fertilisation (gametogenesis and gamete transfer), fertilisation (fusion of gametes), and post-fertilisation (zygote formation and embryogenesis). Organisms exhibit distinct phases in their life cycle — juvenile, reproductive, and senescent — and the relationship between life span and reproduction varies across species.",
    "rules": [
      "Asexual reproduction produces clones (genetically identical offspring) from a single parent",
      "Sexual reproduction involves meiosis to form haploid gametes and fusion (syngamy) to restore the diploid state",
      "The life span of organisms is not necessarily correlated with their body size or reproductive mode"

Elephants and whales are both large animals with relatively long lifespans, while dogs and cats are more similar in size and have comparable lifespans.
