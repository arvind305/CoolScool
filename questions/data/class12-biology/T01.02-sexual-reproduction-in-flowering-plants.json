    "text": "Sexual reproduction in flowering plants (angiosperms) involves the formation of male and female gametophytes within the flower, followed by pollination, double fertilisation, and seed and fruit development. The stamen produces pollen grains (male gametophyte) through microsporogenesis, while the pistil contains the ovule where megasporogenesis gives rise to the embryo sac (female gametophyte), which is typically 7-celled and 8-nucleate. Pollination transfers pollen to the stigma, and pollen-pistil interaction determines compatibility. Double fertilisation, unique to angiosperms, involves one sperm fusing with the egg (forming the zygote) and another fusing with the two polar nuclei (forming the triploid endosperm). The zygote develops into an embryo, the ovule into a seed, and the ovary into a fruit.",

This is because double fertilization first forms the endosperm, which then supports the developing embryo. The ovule integuments then form the seed coat, and finally the ovary develops into the fruit.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect sequence would be to put embryo development before endosperm development. This is wrong because in double fertilization, one sperm cell fuses with the egg to form the zygote that develops into the embryo, while the other sperm cell fuses with the two polar nuclei to form the triploid endosperm. The endosperm develops first to provide nutrients for the growing embryo."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "Self-incompatibility is a genetic mechanism in which the stigma recognises and rejects pollen from the same plant through protein-protein interactions on the pollen grain surface and the stigma. The pollen fails to germinate or the pollen tube is arrested. Since pollen from a different plant (Plant A) germinates normally on Plant B's stigma, it confirms that the rejection is specific to self-pollen, which is characteristic of self-incompatibility.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Dichogamy (option A) involves different maturation times, but Arjun is manually placing pollen, so timing is not the issue. Dioecy (option B) means Plant B has no stamens; but Arjun is using Plant B's own pollen, which means it does produce pollen. Cleistogamy (option C) involves closed flowers, but Arjun is able to access the stigma and dust pollen, so the flower is open."

      "explanation_correct": "Parthenocarpy is the development of fruits without fertilisation, resulting in seedless fruits. Bananas are a classic natural example of parthenocarpy. Since fertilisation does not occur, no seeds are formed, and the fruit develops from the ovary wall without the stimulus of seed development. This is distinct from apomixis, where seeds are formed without fertilisation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Apomixis (option A) produces seeds without fertilisation, but bananas are seedless. Polyembryony (option B) involves multiple embryos in a seed, not seedless fruit. Emasculation (option D) is the removal of anthers for artificial hybridisation and is unrelated to seedless fruit development."

These are all nourishing functions, not protective ones. The tapetum cells eventually disintegrate completely, releasing their contents to the developing pollen.",

Gymnosperms do have ovules and pollen, and they do produce seeds, but their female gametophyte lacks the two polar nuclei found in the angiosperm embryo sac. Therefore, the second fertilisation event — triple fusion leading to triploid endosperm — cannot occur.
