    "text": "Sexual reproduction in flowering plants (angiosperms) involves the formation of male and female gametophytes within the flower, followed by pollination, double fertilisation, and seed and fruit development. The stamen produces pollen grains (male gametophyte) through microsporogenesis, while the pistil contains the ovule where megasporogenesis gives rise to the embryo sac (female gametophyte), which is typically 7-celled and 8-nucleate. Pollination transfers pollen to the stigma, and pollen-pistil interaction determines compatibility. Double fertilisation, unique to angiosperms, involves one sperm fusing with the egg (forming the zygote) and another fusing with the two polar nuclei (forming the triploid endosperm). The zygote develops into an embryo, the ovule into a seed, and the ovary into a fruit.",

      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The correct sequence is endosperm development, embryo development, seed coat formation, and then fruit formation. This is because double fertilization first forms the endosperm, which then supports the developing embryo. The ovule integuments then form the seed coat, and finally the ovary develops into the fruit.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect sequence would be to put embryo development before endosperm development. This is wrong because in double fertilization, one sperm cell fuses with the egg to form the zygote that develops into the embryo, while the other sperm cell fuses with the two polar nuclei to form the triploid endosperm. The endosperm develops first to provide nutrients for the growing embryo."
