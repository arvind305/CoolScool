    "text": "Human reproduction is sexual and involves the male and female reproductive systems working in coordination. The male reproductive system comprises testes (which produce spermatozoa via spermatogenesis), accessory ducts (epididymis, vas deferens, ejaculatory duct, urethra), and accessory glands (seminal vesicles, prostate, bulbourethral glands). The female reproductive system includes ovaries (which produce ova via oogenesis), oviducts, uterus, and external genitalia. The menstrual cycle, regulated by hormones (GnRH, FSH, LH, oestrogen, progesterone), prepares the uterus for implantation every 28 days. Fertilisation occurs in the ampulla of the oviduct, and the resulting zygote undergoes cleavage to form a blastocyst that implants in the uterine endometrium. The placenta sustains the developing embryo, and parturition is triggered by hormonal signals including oxytocin.",
    "rules": [
      "Spermatogenesis produces four functional spermatozoa from each spermatocyte, while oogenesis produces one functional ovum and polar bodies",
      "The menstrual cycle involves coordinated hormonal interplay between the hypothalamus, anterior pituitary, and ovaries",
      "Fertilisation occurs in the ampulla of the fallopian tube, and the blastocyst implants in the uterine endometrium approximately 7 days after fertilisation"

In contrast, oogenesis involves unequal cytokinesis, producing only one large, functional ovum and three small, non-functional polar bodies from each primary oocyte.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The key difference lies in cytoplasmic distribution during meiosis. In spermatogenesis, cytokinesis is equal, yielding four functional spermatozoa. In oogenesis, unequal cytokinesis ensures that most of the cytoplasm (with stored nutrients for the embryo) goes to one cell, producing one functional ovum and three polar bodies that degenerate."

In a 30-day cycle, ovulation would occur at day 30 minus 14 = day 16. This is an important concept for understanding fertility windows and is commonly tested in ISC and NEET examinations.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Day 14 is the ovulation day for a standard 28-day cycle, not a 30-day cycle. The luteal phase is consistently about 14 days, so ovulation day = total cycle length minus 14. For a 30-day cycle, this gives day 16, not day 14, 20, or 10."

It acts on the anterior pituitary to selectively suppress FSH secretion, forming a negative feedback loop. Students often mistakenly attribute all testicular hormonal products to Leydig cells, but Sertoli cells specifically produce inhibin, androgen-binding protein (ABP), and provide nutritional support to developing germ cells.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Testosterone, androgens, and dihydrotestosterone are all products of the Leydig cells (interstitial cells) or downstream conversions of testosterone. Inhibin is the notable exception -- it is produced by Sertoli cells, not Leydig cells, and serves a regulatory feedback role in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis."

Follicular development is a hallmark of the follicular (proliferative) phase, driven by FSH. During the luteal phase, elevated progesterone from the corpus luteum actually inhibits FSH and LH secretion, suppressing new follicular growth until the corpus luteum degenerates.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The corpus luteum secretes both progesterone (predominantly) and some oestrogen during the luteal phase, and these hormones convert the endometrium to a secretory state. All these events genuinely occur during the luteal phase. The exception is rapid Graafian follicle growth, which is suppressed by progesterone-mediated negative feedback on the pituitary."

      "explanation_incorrect": "hCG does maintain the corpus luteum (option A), prevents its degeneration (option B), and is detectable in pregnancy tests (option D). The exception is milk secretion, which is controlled by prolactin and oxytocin from the pituitary gland, not by placental hCG."

      "explanation_correct": "The testes are located in the scrotal sac because spermatogenesis is a temperature-sensitive process that requires a temperature approximately 2-3 degrees Celsius below core body temperature (about 34 degrees Celsius instead of 37 degrees Celsius). The scrotal position, along with mechanisms like the cremaster muscle and pampiniform venous plexus (countercurrent heat exchange), helps maintain this lower temperature essential for normal sperm production.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Blood supply is not the reason; the abdominal cavity also provides adequate blood supply to organs. The scrotum is actually more vulnerable to mechanical injury than the protected abdomen, not less. Testosterone secretion by Leydig cells is not dependent on external air temperature. The true reason is thermoregulation for spermatogenesis."

      "explanation_correct": "When fertilisation does not occur, the corpus luteum is not rescued by hCG and therefore degenerates into the corpus albicans. This results in a sharp decline in progesterone and oestrogen levels. Since these hormones are required to maintain the thickened, secretory endometrium, their withdrawal leads to constriction of spiral arteries, ischaemia, and eventual necrosis and shedding of the endometrial lining, which manifests as menstrual bleeding.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "FSH does rise after menstruation begins (to initiate new follicle recruitment), but it is not the cause of endometrial shedding. Oxytocin causes uterine contractions during parturition, not endometrial shedding. GnRH acts on the anterior pituitary to regulate FSH and LH release, not directly on the endometrium. The true cause is hormonal withdrawal from corpus luteum degeneration."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "The cortical reaction is essential because it prevents polyspermy -- the fertilisation of an ovum by more than one sperm. Upon sperm entry, cortical granules in the ovum's cytoplasm fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents, which modify the zona pellucida (zona reaction) making it impervious to additional sperm. Without this block, multiple sperm nuclei would fuse with the egg nucleus, resulting in a polyploid zygote that is inviable.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The cortical reaction does not provide energy for cleavage (mitochondria do that), does not trigger hCG release (hCG is secreted by the trophoblast after implantation, not at fertilisation), and does not initiate oogenesis (the ovum has already completed most of oogenesis by this point). Its sole critical function is preventing polyspermy through zona pellucida modification."
