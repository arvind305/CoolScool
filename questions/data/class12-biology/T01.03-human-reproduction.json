    "text": "Human reproduction is sexual and involves the male and female reproductive systems working in coordination. The male reproductive system comprises testes (which produce spermatozoa via spermatogenesis), accessory ducts (epididymis, vas deferens, ejaculatory duct, urethra), and accessory glands (seminal vesicles, prostate, bulbourethral glands). The female reproductive system includes ovaries (which produce ova via oogenesis), oviducts, uterus, and external genitalia. The menstrual cycle, regulated by hormones (GnRH, FSH, LH, oestrogen, progesterone), prepares the uterus for implantation every 28 days. Fertilisation occurs in the ampulla of the oviduct, and the resulting zygote undergoes cleavage to form a blastocyst that implants in the uterine endometrium. The placenta sustains the developing embryo, and parturition is triggered by hormonal signals including oxytocin.",
    "rules": [
      "Spermatogenesis produces four functional spermatozoa from each spermatocyte, while oogenesis produces one functional ovum and polar bodies",
      "The menstrual cycle involves coordinated hormonal interplay between the hypothalamus, anterior pituitary, and ovaries",
      "Fertilisation occurs in the ampulla of the fallopian tube, and the blastocyst implants in the uterine endometrium approximately 7 days after fertilisation"

      "explanation_incorrect": "If the statement was false, it would mean that ovulation does not occur around day 14 of the menstrual cycle.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is oxytocin. Oxytocin is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland that stimulates the uterine muscles to contract strongly during childbirth. This helps to push the baby out of the uterus. Other hormones like estrogen and progesterone are involved in the menstrual cycle and pregnancy, but oxytocin is the specific hormone responsible for the uterine contractions that occur during parturition."
