    "text": "Reproductive health refers to a total well-being in all aspects of reproduction — physical, emotional, behavioural, and social. Strategies for maintaining reproductive health include creating awareness about reproduction, providing access to contraception and healthcare, and controlling population growth. Contraceptive methods range from natural (rhythm method, withdrawal) and barrier methods (condoms, diaphragms) to hormonal (oral pills, implants), IUDs (Cu-T, LNG-IUS), and surgical methods (vasectomy, tubectomy). Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as gonorrhoea, syphilis, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B, and genital herpes pose major public health challenges. Infertility can be addressed through assisted reproductive technologies (ART) including IVF, ZIFT, GIFT, ICSI, and artificial insemination.",
    "rules": [
      "Contraceptive methods differ in mechanism, effectiveness, reversibility, and side effects",
      "STIs can be prevented through safe sexual practices and awareness, but many have no permanent cure (e.g., HIV, herpes)",
      "Assisted reproductive technologies help infertile couples but raise ethical, legal, and social issues"

Vasectomy and tubectomy are considered permanent procedures and are not easily reversible. Reversing these surgeries is possible but can be complex and may not always be successful.
