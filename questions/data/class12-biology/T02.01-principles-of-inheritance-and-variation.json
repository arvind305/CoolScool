    "text": "Inheritance is the transmission of genetic information from parents to offspring. Gregor Mendel established the foundational laws of inheritance through his experiments on pea plants: the Law of Dominance, the Law of Segregation, and the Law of Independent Assortment. Extensions of Mendelism include incomplete dominance, codominance, multiple alleles (such as ABO blood groups), pleiotropy, and polygenic inheritance. The Chromosomal Theory of Inheritance, proposed by Sutton and Boveri, linked genes to chromosomes. Linkage and recombination were elucidated by Morgan using Drosophila. Sex determination follows different mechanisms (XX-XY, XX-XO, ZZ-ZW), and sex-linked traits like colour blindness and haemophilia show characteristic inheritance patterns. Genetic disorders include Mendelian (e.g., sickle cell anaemia, PKU) and chromosomal (e.g., Down, Turner, Klinefelter syndromes), which can be traced using pedigree analysis.",
    "rules": [
      "Mendel's Law of Segregation states that the two alleles for each trait separate during gamete formation, and each gamete carries only one allele",
      "Independent assortment applies to genes on different chromosomes; linked genes on the same chromosome may not assort independently",
      "Sex-linked recessive traits are more commonly expressed in males because they have only one X chromosome"

      "explanation_correct": "Mendel's Law of Segregation states that the two alleles for each trait separate during gamete formation, and each gamete receives one of the two alleles. This is also known as the 'law of purity of gametes', as each gamete contains only one allele for a particular trait.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The Law of Independent Assortment refers to the independent inheritance of different traits, not the separation of alleles during gamete formation. Dominance is a different concept that describes how one allele can mask the expression of another allele. Linkage is the tendency of genes located on the same chromosome to be inherited together."

        "Discovery of DNA structure by Watson and Crick"
      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The correct chronological order is Mendel's experiments on pea plants first, which established the basic principles of inheritance, followed by the Chromosomal Theory proposed by Sutton and Boveri that linked these genetic principles to chromosomes. Then came Morgan's work on linkage and recombination in Drosophila, and finally the discovery of the DNA structure by Watson and Crick much later.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be placing Morgan's work on linkage before the Chromosomal Theory. This is not correct because the Chromosomal Theory, which linked genes to chromosomes, had to be proposed first before the specific mechanisms of linkage and recombination could be elucidated by Morgan using Drosophila as the model organism."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order from simplest to most complex is Monohybrid cross, Incomplete dominance, Dihybrid cross, Polygenic inheritance. This sequence represents an increase in the number of genes involved and the complexity of inheritance patterns, from single gene interactions to multiple genes contributing to a trait.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Monohybrid cross, Dihybrid cross, Incomplete dominance, Polygenic inheritance. This is wrong because Dihybrid cross, involving two gene pairs, is more complex than Incomplete dominance, which deals with a single gene pair. Polygenic inheritance, with multiple genes contributing to a trait, is the most complex of the given concepts."
