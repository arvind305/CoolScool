    "text": "The molecular basis of inheritance centres on DNA as the hereditary material. The Watson-Crick model describes DNA as a double-stranded helix with complementary base pairing (A-T, G-C). DNA replication is semi-conservative, as demonstrated by Meselson and Stahl, involving enzymes such as DNA helicase, DNA polymerase, and ligase. The Central Dogma describes the flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA (transcription) to protein (translation). Transcription involves RNA polymerase synthesising mRNA from a DNA template, while translation occurs on ribosomes where tRNA molecules bring amino acids corresponding to codons on mRNA. Gene regulation in prokaryotes is exemplified by the lac operon model. The Human Genome Project mapped all human genes, and DNA fingerprinting uses variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) for individual identification.",
    "rules": [
      "DNA replication is semi-conservative: each new double helix consists of one parental and one newly synthesised strand",
      "The genetic code is triplet, degenerate, universal, non-overlapping, and has start (AUG) and stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA)",
      "In the lac operon, the repressor protein blocks transcription in the absence of lactose; lactose acts as an inducer"

During post-transcriptional processing, introns are removed by the spliceosome complex, and exons are ligated together to form the much shorter mature mRNA. The large size difference (8,000 nt down to 1,200 nt) indicates that the gene contains extensive intronic sequences that were spliced out.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is unlikely because Rohan consistently obtained the same size mature mRNA. Option C is incorrect because the cell does not replace an incorrectly transcribed mRNA with a shorter one — instead, splicing is a normal and essential step. Option D is wrong because translation does not shorten the mRNA; the mRNA template is read but not consumed during protein synthesis."

The lacZ gene encodes beta-galactosidase, explaining the sharp rise in its activity.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is the opposite of what happens — the repressor is released from the operator when lactose is present. Option C is incorrect because glucose does not activate the lac operon; in fact, glucose represses it through catabolite repression. Option D is incorrect because lactose does not cause gene deletion — it simply inactivates the repressor protein through allosteric binding."

In prokaryotes, mRNA is not capped or polyadenylated. RNA polymerase in prokaryotes does bind to the promoter (with sigma factor), unwinds DNA locally, and synthesises RNA in the 5'→3' direction.",
