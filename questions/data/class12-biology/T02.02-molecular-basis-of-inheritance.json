    "text": "The molecular basis of inheritance centres on DNA as the hereditary material. The Watson-Crick model describes DNA as a double-stranded helix with complementary base pairing (A-T, G-C). DNA replication is semi-conservative, as demonstrated by Meselson and Stahl, involving enzymes such as DNA helicase, DNA polymerase, and ligase. The Central Dogma describes the flow of genetic information from DNA to RNA (transcription) to protein (translation). Transcription involves RNA polymerase synthesising mRNA from a DNA template, while translation occurs on ribosomes where tRNA molecules bring amino acids corresponding to codons on mRNA. Gene regulation in prokaryotes is exemplified by the lac operon model. The Human Genome Project mapped all human genes, and DNA fingerprinting uses variable number tandem repeats (VNTRs) for individual identification.",
    "rules": [
      "DNA replication is semi-conservative: each new double helix consists of one parental and one newly synthesised strand",
      "The genetic code is triplet, degenerate, universal, non-overlapping, and has start (AUG) and stop codons (UAA, UAG, UGA)",
      "In the lac operon, the repressor protein blocks transcription in the absence of lactose; lactose acts as an inducer"

      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The correct sequence of events in transcription is: RNA polymerase binds to the promoter, the sigma factor detaches after initiation, the RNA chain is elongated, and finally the RNA is terminated and released. This is the logical order in which transcription occurs, with each step building upon the previous one.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect sequence would be: Termination and release of RNA, RNA polymerase binds to promoter, Sigma factor detaches after initiation, Elongation of RNA chain. This is incorrect because the transcription process starts with RNA polymerase binding to the promoter, then the sigma factor detaches, after which the RNA chain is elongated, and finally the RNA is terminated and released."
