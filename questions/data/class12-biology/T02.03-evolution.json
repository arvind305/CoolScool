    "text": "Evolution is the process of change in heritable characteristics of populations over successive generations. The origin of life is explained by chemical evolution (Oparin-Haldane hypothesis), supported by the Miller-Urey experiment which demonstrated abiotic synthesis of organic molecules. Evidences of evolution include comparative anatomy (homologous and analogous organs), molecular evidence, fossil records, and biogeography. Darwin's theory of natural selection proposed that organisms with favourable variations survive and reproduce more successfully. The Modern Synthetic Theory integrates Darwinian selection with genetics, emphasising the role of mutations, genetic drift, gene flow, and natural selection in evolution. The Hardy-Weinberg principle describes allele frequency equilibrium in non-evolving populations. Speciation (allopatric and sympatric) leads to the formation of new species, and adaptive radiation (e.g., Darwin's finches) illustrates diversification from a common ancestor.",

In sympatric speciation, reproductive isolation develops within the same geographic area through mechanisms such as polyploidy, habitat differentiation, or behavioural isolation, without any physical separation.",

The absence of oxygen was critical because free oxygen is a strong oxidising agent that would have destroyed the organic molecules (amino acids, sugars) as they formed. The Oparin-Haldane hypothesis specifically states that chemical evolution occurred in a reducing atmosphere containing CH4, NH3, H2, and H2O, and the Miller-Urey experiment replicated these conditions.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is irrelevant — oxygen is readily available in any laboratory. Option C, while oxygen can support combustion, the reason for its exclusion is scientific (simulating primitive conditions), not safety-related. Option D is factually wrong — oxygen is a gas under normal conditions. The correct reason is that free oxygen was absent from the early Earth and would have prevented abiotic synthesis of organic molecules."

In cichlids, this produced species with varied jaw structures and feeding strategies; in finches, varied beak shapes suited to different food sources. Meera should conclude that adaptive radiation can occur both on islands (finches) and in lakes (cichlids) when diverse ecological niches are available.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Convergent evolution involves unrelated species independently evolving similar traits, but both cichlids and finches diversified from a single common ancestor within their respective locations. Genetic drift is random and would not produce the systematic, niche-adapted diversity seen in cichlids. The bottleneck effect reduces genetic diversity, which is the opposite of the diversification described. Both cases are adaptive radiation driven by natural selection acting on available ecological niches."

A common misconception is thinking that some selection is compatible with equilibrium, but any non-zero selection pressure changes allele frequencies.",

Lamarck proposed that organisms could pass on characters acquired during their lifetime (e.g., a blacksmith's strong arms), but modern genetics has shown that somatic changes are not transmitted to the germline and thus cannot be inherited. Only changes in the DNA of gametes are passed to offspring. This genetic basis gives Darwin's theory strong experimental support that Lamarck's theory lacks.",

Option C is a logical fallacy — a theory's age does not determine its correctness.
