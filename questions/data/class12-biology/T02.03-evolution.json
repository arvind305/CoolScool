    "text": "Evolution is the process of change in heritable characteristics of populations over successive generations. The origin of life is explained by chemical evolution (Oparin-Haldane hypothesis), supported by the Miller-Urey experiment which demonstrated abiotic synthesis of organic molecules. Evidences of evolution include comparative anatomy (homologous and analogous organs), molecular evidence, fossil records, and biogeography. Darwin's theory of natural selection proposed that organisms with favourable variations survive and reproduce more successfully. The Modern Synthetic Theory integrates Darwinian selection with genetics, emphasising the role of mutations, genetic drift, gene flow, and natural selection in evolution. The Hardy-Weinberg principle describes allele frequency equilibrium in non-evolving populations. Speciation (allopatric and sympatric) leads to the formation of new species, and adaptive radiation (e.g., Darwin's finches) illustrates diversification from a common ancestor.",

Mutation occurs at the individual level, genetic drift is a population-level phenomenon, and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium describes allele frequencies in a population, all of which can happen without reproductive isolation. Speciation, the formation of new distinct species, requires reproductive isolation to prevent gene flow and maintain the divergence between populations."

The genotype is the genetic makeup of an organism, while the phenotype is the observable physical and behavioral characteristics that result from the genotype.

This indicates that the organism has evolved from a different ancestral species that had a use for that particular organ or structure.",

The incorrect answer may have been 'evolution', which is the broader process of change over generations, or 'speciation', which is the formation of new species but does not specifically refer to the diversification from a common ancestor into different niches.

Natural selection favors the survival and reproduction of organisms with beneficial traits that help them adapt to their environment, leading to the gradual evolution of species.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The answer 'natural' is correct because Darwin's theory of evolution states that natural selection is the key mechanism that drives evolution. Natural selection refers to the process where organisms with favorable variations are more likely to survive and reproduce, passing on their advantageous traits to the next generation.
