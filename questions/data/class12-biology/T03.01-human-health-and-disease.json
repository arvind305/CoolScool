    "text": "Human health is affected by genetic factors, infections, and lifestyle choices. Common infectious diseases include bacterial (typhoid, pneumonia), viral (common cold), and protozoan (malaria, amoebiasis) infections, each with specific pathogens, symptoms, and transmission modes. The immune system provides defence through innate immunity (physical barriers, phagocytes) and adaptive immunity (B lymphocytes for humoral response, T lymphocytes for cell-mediated response). Vaccination exploits immune memory to provide protection. Cancer involves uncontrolled cell division caused by activation of oncogenes or inactivation of tumour suppressors, and can be benign or malignant. HIV/AIDS destroys helper T cells, leading to immunodeficiency. Substance abuse (drugs and alcohol) affects physical and mental health and has significant social consequences.",
    "rules": [
      "Innate immunity is non-specific and present from birth, while adaptive immunity is specific and develops after exposure to antigens",
      "The life cycle of Plasmodium involves both a human host (where asexual reproduction occurs) and a female Anopheles mosquito (where sexual reproduction occurs)",
