    "text": "Enhancement in food production relies on animal husbandry and plant breeding. Animal husbandry encompasses dairy farm management, poultry farming, fisheries (inland and marine), and apiculture (bee-keeping). Plant breeding follows a systematic process: collection of genetic variability, evaluation and selection of parents, cross-hybridisation, selection among hybrid progeny, testing, and release of improved varieties. The Green Revolution was driven by high-yielding varieties of wheat and rice. Biofortification aims to develop nutrient-enriched crops (e.g., iron-rich rice, vitamin A-enriched golden rice). Tissue culture technology, including micropropagation and somatic hybridisation, enables rapid multiplication and creation of novel varieties. Single cell protein (SCP) from organisms like Spirulina offers alternative protein sources.",

      "Plant breeding involves systematic crossing of selected parents followed by rigorous selection and testing over multiple generations",
      "Biofortification improves nutritional quality of crops through breeding for higher mineral, vitamin, and protein content",

Apiculture provides honey, beeswax, royal jelly, bee venom, and propolis as direct products. Additionally, bees provide the invaluable ecological service of pollinating crops and wild plants, which significantly boosts agricultural productivity.",

      "correct_answer": "B",

Unlike food fortification (adding nutrients during processing), biofortification does not require industrial infrastructure, additional costs, or access to processed foods. This makes it particularly suitable for resource-poor rural populations who grow and consume their own staple crops, especially in developing countries like India.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Biofortification uses conventional breeding, not necessarily GMO technology (option A). It does not inherently increase yield (option C) or eliminate fertiliser need (option D). The key advantage is the built-in nutritional improvement accessible without additional processing."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "In composite fish culture, species are carefully chosen to occupy different ecological niches. For example, Catla is a surface feeder, Rohu feeds in the middle column, Mrigal and Common carp are bottom feeders, and Grass carp feeds on aquatic weeds. Since they feed at different levels and on different food sources, they do not compete with each other. This maximises utilisation of all available food resources in the pond, resulting in significantly higher total fish yield per unit area compared to monoculture.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Competition (option A) would reduce growth, not increase it. Not just one species is fed (option C); all species access natural food resources at their preferred levels. The species are not genetically identical (option D); they are entirely different species with different feeding habits."

      "explanation_correct": "Somatic hybridisation bypasses the barriers of sexual incompatibility. Some plant species cannot be crossed through conventional hybridisation because they are reproductively isolated. By fusing protoplasts (naked cells) from such incompatible species, somatic hybridisation allows the combination of desirable traits from both species into a single hybrid plant. The pomato (potato + tomato fusion) is a classic example demonstrating this capability.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Somatic hybridisation is actually more technically demanding and expensive (option A), not simpler. It does not guarantee disease resistance (option C) or higher seed production (option D). Its unique advantage is overcoming sexual incompatibility barriers between species."
