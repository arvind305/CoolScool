    "text": "Microbes play essential roles in human welfare beyond causing disease. In household products, Lactobacillus converts milk to curd, yeasts ferment dough, and various bacteria and fungi produce cheese. Industrially, microbes produce antibiotics (e.g., Penicillium produces penicillin), organic acids (citric acid from Aspergillus niger), enzymes (lipases, proteases), and fermented beverages. In sewage treatment, microbes decompose organic matter through primary, secondary (activated sludge), and tertiary treatment, reducing Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD). Methanogens in biogas plants convert organic waste to biogas (methane). As biocontrol agents, Bacillus thuringiensis, Trichoderma, and baculoviruses help manage pests. As biofertilisers, Rhizobium fixes nitrogen in legume root nodules, Azospirillum is a free-living nitrogen fixer, mycorrhizal fungi enhance phosphorus uptake, and cyanobacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen.",
    "rules": [
      "BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) measures the amount of dissolved oxygen consumed by microbes to decompose organic matter; high BOD indicates polluted water",
      "Methanogens like Methanobacterium are anaerobic archaebacteria that produce methane during biogas production",
      "Biofertilisers are organisms that enrich the nutrient quality of soil; Rhizobium, mycorrhiza, and cyanobacteria are key examples"

The other pairings are correct: Aspergillus niger produces citric acid, Trichoderma polysporum produces cyclosporin A, and Monascus purpureus produces statins.",

Mycorrhiza (symbiotic association between fungi and plant roots) enhances phosphorus absorption from soil by increasing root surface area through fungal hyphae, but does not fix atmospheric nitrogen.

Activated sludge in secondary treatment contains predominantly aerobic bacteria and fungi that require oxygen to rapidly decompose organic matter.

Other species (like P. roqueforti and P. camemberti) are intentionally used in cheese production. While some Penicillium species can spoil food or cause allergies, the tremendous medical and industrial benefits from antibiotic production and food fermentation outweigh these negative aspects, justifying its classification as a beneficial microorganism.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation_correct": "Baculoviruses are classified as highly specific biocontrol agents because they exhibit narrow host range—each baculovirus species typically infects only one or a few closely related insect species. This specificity arises from the virus's requirement for specific cell surface receptors on target insect gut cells. This precision allows targeted control of pest species (like Helicoverpa armigera) while preserving beneficial insects (pollinators, predators, parasitoids), non-target organisms, and environmental health—a crucial advantage over broad-spectrum chemical pesticides that kill indiscriminately.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The other options present incorrect reasoning: B) Baculoviruses are highly specific, not indiscriminate killers—this is the key reason for their classification; C) Baculoviruses are biological agents (viruses), not chemical compounds; D) Baculoviruses are biocontrol agents against insects, not nitrogen-fixing organisms—that function belongs to bacteria like Rhizobium."

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation_correct": "High BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) indicates water pollution because it measures the amount of dissolved oxygen that aerobic microorganisms consume while decomposing organic matter. High BOD means abundant organic pollutants (sewage, agricultural runoff, industrial waste) present in water. As microbes decompose this organic matter, they deplete dissolved oxygen, creating hypoxic or anoxic conditions that suffocate fish and other aquatic organisms. Clean water has low BOD (<3 mg/L) because minimal organic matter requires minimal oxygen for decomposition. Thus, high BOD directly correlates with pollution, not purity.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The other options present incorrect reasoning: B) High BOD indicates oxygen depletion, not high oxygen content—this reverses the actual relationship; C) BOD measures organic pollution through oxygen consumption, not water clarity or transparency—that is measured by turbidity; D) High BOD indicates organic pollution from waste, not beneficial nitrogen-fixing bacteria."
