    "text": "Microbes play essential roles in human welfare beyond causing disease. In household products, Lactobacillus converts milk to curd, yeasts ferment dough, and various bacteria and fungi produce cheese. Industrially, microbes produce antibiotics (e.g., Penicillium produces penicillin), organic acids (citric acid from Aspergillus niger), enzymes (lipases, proteases), and fermented beverages. In sewage treatment, microbes decompose organic matter through primary, secondary (activated sludge), and tertiary treatment, reducing Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD). Methanogens in biogas plants convert organic waste to biogas (methane). As biocontrol agents, Bacillus thuringiensis, Trichoderma, and baculoviruses help manage pests. As biofertilisers, Rhizobium fixes nitrogen in legume root nodules, Azospirillum is a free-living nitrogen fixer, mycorrhizal fungi enhance phosphorus uptake, and cyanobacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen.",
    "rules": [
      "BOD (Biological Oxygen Demand) measures the amount of dissolved oxygen consumed by microbes to decompose organic matter; high BOD indicates polluted water",
      "Methanogens like Methanobacterium are anaerobic archaebacteria that produce methane during biogas production",
      "Biofertilisers are organisms that enrich the nutrient quality of soil; Rhizobium, mycorrhiza, and cyanobacteria are key examples"
