    "text": "Biotechnology involves the use of living organisms or their products to develop useful processes and products. Genetic engineering, a core technique, uses restriction enzymes (molecular scissors) to cut DNA at specific recognition sequences, DNA ligase to join fragments, and cloning vectors (such as plasmids like pBR322) to carry foreign DNA into host cells. The key processes of recombinant DNA technology include: isolation of DNA, fragmentation using restriction endonucleases, amplification by PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), ligation into vectors, transformation into competent host cells, and selection of recombinants using selectable markers (e.g., antibiotic resistance, blue-white screening). Gel electrophoresis separates DNA fragments by size. Bioreactors (stirred-tank type) are used for large-scale production, followed by downstream processing for purification of the desired product.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is B) Size (smaller fragments migrate faster). Gel electrophoresis works by applying an electric field to the DNA fragments, which causes them to move through the gel matrix. Smaller DNA fragments have less resistance to this movement and therefore travel faster through the gel, separating from the larger fragments. The chemical composition and temperature of the DNA do not directly affect the separation during gel electrophoresis."
