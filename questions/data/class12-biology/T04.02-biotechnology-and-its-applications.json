    "text": "Biotechnology has wide-ranging applications in agriculture, medicine, and industry. In agriculture, Bt crops (like Bt cotton) express Cry proteins from Bacillus thuringiensis that are toxic to specific insect pests. RNA interference (RNAi) has been used to develop pest-resistant plants, such as those resistant to nematode Meloidogyne. Golden rice, enriched with beta-carotene, exemplifies nutritional enhancement through GM technology. In medicine, recombinant human insulin (Humulin) is produced in E. coli, gene therapy has been applied to treat ADA deficiency, and molecular diagnostics (ELISA, PCR) enable precise disease detection. Transgenic animals like Rosie (a cow producing human protein-enriched milk) serve research, pharmaceutical, and testing purposes. Ethical concerns surrounding GMOs, biopiracy (e.g., patents on neem, turmeric, basmati rice), and biosafety remain important societal issues.",
    "rules": [
      "Bt toxin (Cry protein) exists as an inactive protoxin in bacteria and becomes active only in the alkaline gut of insect larvae",
      "Gene therapy involves the correction of a genetic defect by introducing a functional gene into the patient's cells",
      "Biopiracy refers to the use of biological resources or traditional knowledge of a country by multinational companies without proper authorisation or compensation"

      "explanation_incorrect": "Bt cotton does not produce antibiotics or pesticide chemicals in its leaves. While some plants do have thorns to deter insects, Bt cotton achieves its pest resistance through the expression of the Cry proteins from the bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis, which are specifically toxic to certain insect larvae."

Transgenic animals are used for a variety of purposes, such as testing the safety and efficacy of drugs and vaccines (option A), understanding gene regulation and disease models (option C), and producing biological products like proteins in milk (option D). However, they are not used to directly increase the rate of natural selection in wild populations, which is the key reason why option B is the correct answer."
