    "text": "Ecology studies the interactions between organisms and their environment. Organisms respond to abiotic factors (temperature, water, light, soil) through regulation, conforming, migration, or suspension (dormancy). Adaptations like Allen's rule (shorter extremities in colder climates) and Bergmann's rule (larger body size in colder climates) illustrate physiological and morphological adaptations. Population ecology examines attributes such as population size, density, birth and death rates, age distribution, and sex ratio. Population growth follows either an exponential model (J-curve: dN/dt = rN) in unlimited resources, or a logistic model (S-curve: dN/dt = rN(K-N)/K) where K is the carrying capacity. Interspecific interactions include mutualism (+/+), competition (-/-), predation (+/-), parasitism (+/-), commensalism (+/0), and amensalism (-/0).",
    "rules": [
      "Exponential growth (dN/dt = rN) occurs when resources are unlimited; logistic growth (dN/dt = rN(K-N)/K) occurs when resources are limited, and population stabilises at carrying capacity K",
      "Allen's rule states that extremities of endotherms are shorter in colder regions to minimise heat loss; Bergmann's rule states that body size is larger in colder climates",
      "Interspecific interactions are classified based on whether each species is benefited (+), harmed (-), or unaffected (0)"

Migration is the seasonal movement of organisms to a different location, not dormancy.
