    "text": "An ecosystem is a functional unit of nature comprising biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) components that interact through energy flow and nutrient cycling. Productivity is the rate of biomass production: Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) is total photosynthesis, Net Primary Productivity (NPP) is GPP minus respiration. Energy flows unidirectionally through trophic levels via food chains (grazing and detritus) and food webs. Lindeman's 10% law states that only about 10% of energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next. Ecological pyramids (of number, biomass, and energy) represent trophic structure. Decomposition involves fragmentation, leaching, catabolism, humification, and mineralisation. Nutrient cycling (carbon and phosphorus cycles) involves the movement of elements between biotic and abiotic components. Ecological succession (primary and secondary) describes the sequential change in community composition over time, culminating in a climax community.",
    "rules": [
      "Energy flow through an ecosystem is unidirectional: from producers to consumers, with roughly 10% transferred at each trophic level (Lindeman's 10% law)",
      "Ecological pyramids of energy are always upright, while pyramids of biomass may be inverted (e.g., in aquatic ecosystems)",
      "Primary succession starts on bare substrate (e.g., rock), while secondary succession occurs in areas where a community has been disturbed but soil and seeds remain"

A food web is more stable than a food chain because it provides multiple alternative pathways for energy to flow through the ecosystem.

In the grazing food chain, energy flows from producers (plants) to primary consumers (herbivores) and then to higher-level predators.

A food web is a more accurate term than a 'food chain' because it represents the complex, interconnected feeding relationships in an ecosystem, rather than a simple linear sequence of one organism feeding on another.
