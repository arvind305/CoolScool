    "text": "Biodiversity is the variety of life on Earth, measured at three levels: genetic diversity (variation within a species), species diversity (variety of species in an area), and ecosystem diversity (variety of habitats and ecosystems). The species-area relationship (log S = log C + Z log A) described by Alexander von Humboldt shows that species richness increases with area. Latitudinal gradients show that biodiversity is greatest in the tropics. Paul Ehrlich's Rivet Popper hypothesis uses the analogy of rivets on an airplane to illustrate how the loss of species weakens ecosystem function. Causes of biodiversity loss include habitat destruction, fragmentation, overexploitation, alien species invasions, and co-extinctions. Conservation strategies include in-situ (biosphere reserves, national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, sacred groves) and ex-situ (botanical gardens, zoos, seed banks, cryopreservation). Biodiversity hotspots are regions with high endemism and high threat levels.",
    "rules": [
      "The species-area relationship follows log S = log C + Z log A, where Z typically ranges from 0.1 to 0.35 for different regions",
      "Biodiversity hotspots are defined by having at least 1,500 endemic vascular plant species and having lost at least 70% of their original habitat",
      "In-situ conservation protects species in their natural habitats; ex-situ conservation protects species outside their natural habitats"

      "explanation_correct": "Two distinct causes from the 'Evil Quartet' are illustrated. First, the introduction of domestic cats by settlers represents alien species invasion — an exotic predator decimating native wildlife. Second, the disappearance of a parasitic insect that was obligately dependent on a declining native bird species represents co-extinction — when the host species declines to the point of extinction, the parasite that depends exclusively on it also goes extinct. Together, these illustrate two of Jared Diamond's four major causes of biodiversity loss.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because there is no mention of direct overexploitation (hunting, poaching) by humans or habitat destruction. Option C incorrectly includes overexploitation — the cats are invasive predators, not harvested resources. Option D mentions habitat fragmentation, which is not described in the scenario; the primary threat is from introduced cats."

Meera should correctly classify the former as ex-situ and the latter as in-situ.",

The tropics remained relatively undisturbed, allowing longer evolutionary time for speciation. Options A, B, and D are all well-established hypotheses for tropical megadiversity.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "A common misconception is that disturbance events like glaciations promote biodiversity. While intermediate disturbance can sometimes increase local diversity, the severe and repeated glaciations of temperate zones actually reduced species richness. The tropics are megadiverse precisely because they were spared from such catastrophic disturbances, allowing species to accumulate over millions of years of stable conditions."

The number of protected areas within the region is not part of the hotspot criteria. A region can be a hotspot even if it has very few or no formally designated protected areas.",

Overexploitation involves the intentional or direct harvesting, hunting, or extraction of organisms at rates exceeding their reproductive capacity. Options A, B, and D are all genuine examples of overexploitation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Students commonly mistake any human-caused species decline as overexploitation. The vulture decline was due to unintentional chemical contamination through the veterinary drug diclofenac — nobody was harvesting or hunting vultures. Overexploitation requires direct extraction or killing of organisms (hunting, fishing, collection), as seen in the cases of passenger pigeons, Steller's sea cow, and commercial overfishing."

Tropical regions have remained climatically stable for tens of millions of years, escaping the devastating Pleistocene glaciations that repeatedly wiped out species in temperate and polar zones. This long period of stability allowed continuous speciation without catastrophic mass extinction events, enabling species to accumulate to high levels. Temperature alone cannot explain the pattern — it is the stability and duration of favourable conditions that matters most.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A oversimplifies the relationship between temperature and mutation — while metabolic rates are higher in warm environments, the primary explanation for the latitudinal gradient is evolutionary time, not mutation rate alone. Option C reverses the facts — tropics have had longer undisturbed evolutionary time. Option D is an extreme statement; temperature does influence diversity, but the question asks about the primary reason, which is climatic stability."

This means many island species have lost anti-predator behaviours (e.g. flightless birds like the dodo), have naïve immune systems, and cannot effectively compete with or escape from novel invaders. Continental species, by contrast, have co-evolved with a wider range of predators and competitors and tend to have better-developed defence mechanisms.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect — islands are smaller, not larger, than continents, and have fewer species. Option C is wrong — island species do not necessarily reproduce faster; in fact, many island species are K-selected with slow reproduction rates.
