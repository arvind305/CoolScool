    "text": "Biodiversity is the variety of life on Earth, measured at three levels: genetic diversity (variation within a species), species diversity (variety of species in an area), and ecosystem diversity (variety of habitats and ecosystems). The species-area relationship (log S = log C + Z log A) described by Alexander von Humboldt shows that species richness increases with area. Latitudinal gradients show that biodiversity is greatest in the tropics. Paul Ehrlich's Rivet Popper hypothesis uses the analogy of rivets on an airplane to illustrate how the loss of species weakens ecosystem function. Causes of biodiversity loss include habitat destruction, fragmentation, overexploitation, alien species invasions, and co-extinctions. Conservation strategies include in-situ (biosphere reserves, national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, sacred groves) and ex-situ (botanical gardens, zoos, seed banks, cryopreservation). Biodiversity hotspots are regions with high endemism and high threat levels.",
    "rules": [
      "The species-area relationship follows log S = log C + Z log A, where Z typically ranges from 0.1 to 0.35 for different regions",
      "Biodiversity hotspots are defined by having at least 1,500 endemic vascular plant species and having lost at least 70% of their original habitat",
      "In-situ conservation protects species in their natural habitats; ex-situ conservation protects species outside their natural habitats"

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order from most restrictive to least restrictive is National park, Wildlife sanctuary, Biosphere reserve (transition zone). National parks have the strictest rules, with no human activity allowed except for research and tourism. Wildlife sanctuaries allow some human activities like collection of non-timber forest products. The transition zone of a biosphere reserve allows the most human use, with sustainable development activities.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Biosphere reserve (transition zone), Wildlife sanctuary, National park. This is wrong because the transition zone of a biosphere reserve actually allows the most human activity, while national parks have the strictest rules with no human use allowed except for research and tourism. Wildlife sanctuaries fall in the middle, with some human activities permitted."
