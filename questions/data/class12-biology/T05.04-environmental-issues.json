    "text": "Environmental issues encompass pollution, deforestation, global warming, and ozone depletion, all of which threaten ecosystems and human health. Air pollution includes particulate matter, SO2, NOx, and CO, controlled by devices like electrostatic precipitators, scrubbers, and catalytic converters. Water pollution results from domestic sewage (measured by BOD), industrial effluents, and agricultural runoff, leading to eutrophication. Solid waste management employs the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle). Biomagnification causes increasing concentration of persistent pollutants (like DDT) at higher trophic levels. Ozone depletion is caused by CFCs and addressed by the Montreal Protocol. The enhanced greenhouse effect leads to global warming due to rising CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Deforestation causes habitat loss, soil erosion, and increased carbon emissions. Environmental movements like the Chipko movement and Joint Forest Management demonstrate community-based conservation approaches.",
    "rules": [
      "Eutrophication is caused by excess nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus) leading to algal blooms, oxygen depletion, and death of aquatic organisms",
      "Biomagnification increases the concentration of non-biodegradable pollutants at each successive trophic level",
      "The Montreal Protocol (1987) is an international agreement to phase out the production of ozone-depleting substances including CFCs"

It is specifically designed to remove particulate matter from industrial air emissions, not to address other types of environmental pollution. The correct answer is that an electrostatic precipitator is used to control particulate air pollution from industrial sources."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "The enhanced greenhouse effect is primarily caused by increased emission of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) due to human activities like burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and agriculture. These greenhouse gases trap more heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to global warming.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The enhanced greenhouse effect is not caused by a decrease in atmospheric CO2 or solar radiation. It is also not caused by volcanic eruptions alone, as human activities like burning of fossil fuels contribute significantly more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. The correct answer is the increased emission of greenhouse gases due to human activities."

The radioactive elements in the waste continue to emit this harmful radiation for decades or even centuries, posing a serious threat to living organisms and the environment.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Radioactive waste is not biodegradable, so it cannot break down over time. It also cannot improve soil fertility, as radioactive elements are harmful to plants and the environment. Radioactive waste cannot be safely disposed of in regular landfills, as the radiation can contaminate the surrounding area and pose a serious health risk. The correct answer is that radioactive waste is dangerous due to the harmful radiation it emits, which can have long-lasting effects on living beings and the environment."

This oxygen depletion is the main reason why eutrophication is harmful to aquatic life.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement is true. Eutrophication results in the death of aquatic organisms because the excessive growth of algae and their subsequent decomposition by microbes deplete the oxygen levels in the water.

The movement involved local villagers, especially women, physically embracing the trees to prevent them from being felled, hence the name 'Chipko' which means 'to hug' or 'to cling to'.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'trees'.
