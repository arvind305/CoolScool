    "text": "Environmental issues encompass pollution, deforestation, global warming, and ozone depletion, all of which threaten ecosystems and human health. Air pollution includes particulate matter, SO2, NOx, and CO, controlled by devices like electrostatic precipitators, scrubbers, and catalytic converters. Water pollution results from domestic sewage (measured by BOD), industrial effluents, and agricultural runoff, leading to eutrophication. Solid waste management employs the 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle). Biomagnification causes increasing concentration of persistent pollutants (like DDT) at higher trophic levels. Ozone depletion is caused by CFCs and addressed by the Montreal Protocol. The enhanced greenhouse effect leads to global warming due to rising CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Deforestation causes habitat loss, soil erosion, and increased carbon emissions. Environmental movements like the Chipko movement and Joint Forest Management demonstrate community-based conservation approaches.",
    "rules": [
      "Eutrophication is caused by excess nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus) leading to algal blooms, oxygen depletion, and death of aquatic organisms",
      "Biomagnification increases the concentration of non-biodegradable pollutants at each successive trophic level",
      "The Montreal Protocol (1987) is an international agreement to phase out the production of ozone-depleting substances including CFCs"

It is specifically designed to remove particulate matter from industrial air emissions, not to address other types of environmental pollution. The correct answer is that an electrostatic precipitator is used to control particulate air pollution from industrial sources."

These greenhouse gases trap more heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to global warming.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The enhanced greenhouse effect is not caused by a decrease in atmospheric CO2 or solar radiation. It is also not caused by volcanic eruptions alone, as human activities like burning of fossil fuels contribute significantly more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. The correct answer is the increased emission of greenhouse gases due to human activities."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Radioactive waste is not biodegradable, so it cannot break down over time. It also cannot improve soil fertility, as radioactive elements are harmful to plants and the environment. Radioactive waste cannot be safely disposed of in regular landfills, as the radiation can contaminate the surrounding area and pose a serious health risk. The correct answer is that radioactive waste is dangerous due to the harmful radiation it emits, which can have long-lasting effects on living beings and the environment."

This oxygen depletion is the main reason why eutrophication is harmful to aquatic life.",

These gases react with atmospheric water vapour and oxygen to form sulphuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3), which are deposited as acid rain. Acid rain reacts with calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in marble, dissolving and pitting the surface, and accelerates oxidative corrosion of iron. This phenomenon is well documented; the Taj Mahal's marble has suffered from acid rain originating from the Mathura refinery and surrounding industries.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because UV radiation from ozone depletion primarily affects biological systems, not the chemical degradation of marble. Option C is wrong because global warming does not directly cause structural deterioration of marble or iron. Option D is implausible as the primary mechanism because while particulate matter can cause soiling, the rapid chemical deterioration of marble and iron described is characteristic of acid rain corrosion."

This is a common misconception that confuses two separate environmental issues. Ozone depletion allows more UV-B radiation to reach Earth's surface (causing skin cancer, cataracts, and phytoplankton damage), while global warming is caused by increased greenhouse gas concentrations trapping infrared radiation. While both involve atmospheric changes, the ozone hole itself does not absorb and radiate heat to warm the planet. In fact, stratospheric ozone loss can cause slight cooling of the stratosphere.",

Increased UV-B penetration raises skin cancer risk, accelerates cataract development, and reduces phytoplankton productivity (which forms the base of marine food chains).

Students often confuse 'water pollution' with 'biomagnification,' but only non-biodegradable, lipophilic, persistent pollutants undergo biomagnification.

This is a common misconception where students conflate different environmental problems. Deforestation directly causes habitat loss and reduced biodiversity, exposes soil to erosion by rain and wind, and disrupts the water cycle by eliminating transpiration from trees, which reduces local humidity and rainfall. However, it does not release ozone-depleting substances into the stratosphere.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Options A, B, and D are all well-documented direct consequences of deforestation. Loss of forest habitat directly reduces biodiversity.

Lead from leaded petrol deposits on these catalyst surfaces, a process called catalyst poisoning, physically blocking the active sites and permanently deactivating the converter.

Additionally, DDT is strongly lipophilic (fat-soluble) and hydrophobic (water-insoluble), so it partitions into the fatty tissues of organisms rather than being excreted. These two properties, chemical stability and lipophilicity, together explain why DDT persists for decades in the environment and undergoes biomagnification through food chains.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because DDT is highly hydrophobic (water-insoluble), not water-soluble, which is precisely why it accumulates in fatty tissues rather than being washed away.

The movement arose spontaneously as a direct response to government-sanctioned commercial logging contracts, not as a government programme.
