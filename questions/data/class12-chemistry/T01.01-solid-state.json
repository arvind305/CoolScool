    "text": "The solid state is characterised by a definite shape, definite volume, and rigidity. Solids are classified as crystalline (having a regular, repeating three-dimensional arrangement of atoms, ions, or molecules) and amorphous (lacking long-range order). Crystalline solids exhibit anisotropy while amorphous solids are isotropic. The smallest repeating unit of a crystal lattice is the unit cell, which can be primitive (simple cubic) or centred (body-centred cubic, face-centred cubic). Important properties such as packing efficiency, coordination number, and density can be calculated from unit cell parameters. Crystal imperfections known as point defects (Schottky and Frenkel defects) influence electrical and other properties. Solids are also classified by their electrical behaviour as conductors, semiconductors (n-type and p-type), and insulators, and by their magnetic behaviour as diamagnetic, paramagnetic, or ferromagnetic.",
    "rules": [
      "Crystalline solids have long-range order and sharp melting points; amorphous solids lack long-range order and soften over a range of temperatures.",
      "The number of atoms per unit cell is: simple cubic = 1, bcc = 2, fcc = 4; packing efficiency is scc ~52.4%, bcc ~68%, fcc/hcp ~74%.",
      "Schottky defects arise from missing cation-anion pairs (density decreases), while Frenkel defects arise when smaller ions are displaced into interstitial sites (density unchanged)."

Instead, they have a disordered, random arrangement of atoms or molecules. This lack of long-range order is what makes amorphous solids isotropic, rather than anisotropic like crystalline solids."

Since no mass is lost from the crystal, only rearranged, the density remains unchanged.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The key difference is whether mass leaves the crystal.

This difference arises because fcc has 4 atoms per unit cell compared to bcc's 2 atoms, and fcc achieves closer packing through its face-centered arrangement.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Packing efficiency measures the percentage of space occupied by atoms in a unit cell. The fcc structure achieves the theoretical maximum packing for spheres (74%) through its arrangement where atoms at face centers create closer packing. The bcc structure, while efficient at 68%, leaves slightly more empty space due to its geometry where the body-centered atom doesn't allow as close packing as the fcc arrangement."

In p-type semiconductors, doping with Group 13 elements (like boron or gallium) which have 3 valence electrons creates electron deficiencies or 'holes', making holes the majority charge carriers.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The type of semiconductor is determined by the dopant used. N-type gets its name from 'negative' because electrons (negatively charged) are the majority carriers when doped with electron-rich elements.

For 4 O²⁻ ions (typical ccp unit cell): 8 tetrahedral voids (all filled by X⁺) and 4 octahedral voids (all filled by Y²⁺). This gives X₈Y₄O₄, which simplifies to X₂YO when checking charges or X₄YO₂ when considering the unit cell. However, the direct ratio is X₈Y₄O₄ = X₄YO₂ when halved.",

With 4 O²⁻ in the unit cell, we get 8 X⁺ (in 8 tetrahedral voids) and 4 Y²⁺ (in 4 octahedral voids), giving the ratio 8:4:4 or simplified 4:2:2, but we need to maintain the smallest whole number ratio considering charge balance: X₄YO₂."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Glass is an amorphous solid with a disordered, random arrangement of particles lacking long-range order. This irregular structure means different regions have varying bonding strengths, causing gradual softening over a temperature range. NaCl is a crystalline solid with a regular, ordered ionic lattice where all ions experience identical bonding environments, resulting in simultaneous breakdown at a specific, sharp melting point.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The melting behavior directly reflects the internal structure. Amorphous materials like glass have no long-range order, so particles in different local environments require different energies to separate, leading to gradual melting. Crystalline materials like NaCl have uniform, repeating structures where all particles are identically bonded, requiring the same energy for separation and thus melting sharply at one temperature."

      "explanation_incorrect": "A common misconception is that creating vacancies might somehow increase density by allowing closer packing.

When boron substitutes for silicon in the crystal lattice, it can form only three covalent bonds, leaving one bond with an electron deficiency or 'hole'. This hole can accept electrons from neighboring atoms, making holes the majority charge carriers and creating a p-type semiconductor. The key reason is the electron count difference.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The p-type behavior is fundamentally about valence electron count, not atomic size, electronegativity, or lattice energy. Boron's 3 valence electrons versus silicon's 4 creates an electron deficiency in the bonding structure. Electronegativity difference would affect bond polarity but doesn't create mobile holes. Atomic size and lattice energy are secondary factors that don't explain the creation of positive charge carriers."

The fcc structure achieves 74% packing efficiency through its ABCABC stacking sequence, which is the theoretical maximum for packing identical spheres. The bcc structure, despite having a body-centered atom, achieves only 68% efficiency due to its geometric arrangement leaving more interstitial space. The fundamental reason is the superior geometric packing arrangement of fcc, not the number of atoms, bond strength, or atomic size.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "While fcc does have more atoms per unit cell (4 vs 2), this is a consequence, not a cause, of the packing arrangement. Bond strength varies by element, not structure type. Atomic radii are a property of the element, not the crystal structure. The real reason is purely geometric: the fcc arrangement positions atoms in a way that minimizes empty space between spheres, achieving the closest possible packing."

In AgBr, the Ag⁺ cation (ionic radius ~115 pm) is significantly smaller than the Br⁻ anion (~196 pm), allowing Ag⁺ ions to easily move from lattice sites into interstitial spaces, creating Frenkel defects. In NaCl, Na⁺ and Cl⁻ have similar sizes (~102 and ~181 pm), making interstitial occupation difficult. Instead, equal numbers of both ions are missing, forming Schottky defects. The size ratio is the determining factor.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "While bond strength, lattice energy, and solubility are important crystal properties, they don't determine defect type. The critical factor is whether the smaller ion can fit into interstitial spaces. Large size differences favor Frenkel defects (ion displacement), while similar sizes favor Schottky defects (ion pair removal).
