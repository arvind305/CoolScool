    "text": "The solid state is characterised by a definite shape, definite volume, and rigidity. Solids are classified as crystalline (having a regular, repeating three-dimensional arrangement of atoms, ions, or molecules) and amorphous (lacking long-range order). Crystalline solids exhibit anisotropy while amorphous solids are isotropic. The smallest repeating unit of a crystal lattice is the unit cell, which can be primitive (simple cubic) or centred (body-centred cubic, face-centred cubic). Important properties such as packing efficiency, coordination number, and density can be calculated from unit cell parameters. Crystal imperfections known as point defects (Schottky and Frenkel defects) influence electrical and other properties. Solids are also classified by their electrical behaviour as conductors, semiconductors (n-type and p-type), and insulators, and by their magnetic behaviour as diamagnetic, paramagnetic, or ferromagnetic.",
    "rules": [
      "Crystalline solids have long-range order and sharp melting points; amorphous solids lack long-range order and soften over a range of temperatures.",
      "The number of atoms per unit cell is: simple cubic = 1, bcc = 2, fcc = 4; packing efficiency is scc ~52.4%, bcc ~68%, fcc/hcp ~74%.",
      "Schottky defects arise from missing cation-anion pairs (density decreases), while Frenkel defects arise when smaller ions are displaced into interstitial sites (density unchanged)."

Instead, they have a disordered, random arrangement of atoms or molecules. This lack of long-range order is what makes amorphous solids isotropic, rather than anisotropic like crystalline solids."

      "explanation_correct": "The coordination number increases in the order: simple cubic (6), body-centered cubic (bcc, 8), face-centered cubic (fcc, 12), and hexagonal close-packed (hcp, 12). This is because the number of nearest neighbors increases as the packing efficiency of the unit cell increases from simple cubic to hcp.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be A, B, D, C. This is because the coordination number of simple cubic (A) is 6, body-centered cubic (B) is 8, hexagonal close-packed (D) is 12, and face-centered cubic (C) is also 12. The coordination number increases as the packing efficiency of the unit cell increases, so the correct order is A, B, C, D."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be C, B, A. This is because conductors have the highest electrical conductivity, followed by semiconductors, and insulators have the lowest conductivity. Conductors have a high density of free electrons that can easily move and carry electric current, while insulators have tightly bound electrons that cannot freely move and conduct electricity."
