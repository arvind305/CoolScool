    "text": "A solution is a homogeneous mixture of two or more substances. The component present in larger amount is the solvent and the one in smaller amount is the solute. Concentration can be expressed in terms of molarity, molality, mole fraction, and mass percentage. The solubility of gases in liquids is governed by Henry's law (p = KH x). Raoult's law states that the partial vapour pressure of each volatile component in a solution is directly proportional to its mole fraction. Ideal solutions obey Raoult's law at all compositions while non-ideal solutions show positive or negative deviations. Colligative properties (relative lowering of vapour pressure, boiling point elevation, freezing point depression, and osmotic pressure) depend on the number of solute particles and are used to determine molar masses. The van't Hoff factor (i) accounts for association or dissociation of solutes.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Molarity is the number of moles of solute per litre of solution, while molality is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. The key difference is that molality does not depend on the volume of the solution, which can change with temperature, but rather on the mass of the solvent, which is more stable. Therefore, option B, 'Kilogram of solvent', is the correct definition of molality."

In contrast, acetic acid can undergo partial association (dimerization through hydrogen bonding) even in water at certain concentrations, reducing the effective particle count (i < 1).
