    "text": "Electrochemistry deals with the interconversion of chemical energy and electrical energy. Galvanic (voltaic) cells convert chemical energy into electrical energy through spontaneous redox reactions, while electrolytic cells use electrical energy to drive non-spontaneous reactions. The electrode potential is the tendency of an electrode to gain or lose electrons, measured relative to the Standard Hydrogen Electrode (SHE). The Nernst equation relates cell potential to concentration: E = E° - (RT/nF) ln Q. The relationship between Gibbs energy and cell potential is given by delta G = -nFE. Conductance of electrolytic solutions is characterised by specific conductivity, molar conductivity, and Kohlrausch's law. Faraday's laws of electrolysis quantitatively relate the amount of substance deposited to the quantity of electricity passed. Practical applications include batteries (dry cell, lead storage, fuel cells) and understanding corrosion as an electrochemical process.",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order from highest to lowest reducing power is A, B, C, D. The reduction potential (E°) values indicate the tendency to lose electrons - the more negative the value, the greater the reducing power. Potassium (D) has the most negative E° value at -2.93 V, so it is the strongest reducing agent, followed by zinc (C), copper (B), and silver (A).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be arranging the elements from highest to lowest E° value, which is A, B, C, D. This is incorrect because the reducing power is inversely related to the reduction potential - the more negative the E° value, the greater the reducing power. The correct order is from strongest reducing agent (D) to weakest (A)."

      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The order of increasing molar conductivity at infinite dilution is D, C, A, B. This is because the molar conductivity depends on the ionic mobility, which is higher for smaller, more highly charged ions. The order follows the trend of decreasing ionic radius: Li+ < Na+ < K+ < H+.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to arrange the electrolytes from highest to lowest molar conductivity. This is incorrect because the molar conductivity is influenced by the ionic radius and charge of the ions. Smaller, more highly charged ions have higher molar conductivity. The correct order is from lowest to highest molar conductivity: D (LiCl, 115), C (NaCl, 126), A (KCl, 150), B (HCl, 426)."
