    "text": "Chemical kinetics is the study of the rates of chemical reactions and the factors that affect them. The rate of a reaction is the change in concentration of a reactant or product per unit time. The rate law expression relates the rate to the concentrations of reactants raised to appropriate powers (orders). The molecularity refers to the number of reacting species in an elementary step, while the order is determined experimentally. Integrated rate equations for zero-order (linear decrease in concentration) and first-order (exponential decay) reactions are used to calculate rate constants and half-lives. The half-life for a first-order reaction is t1/2 = 0.693/k (independent of initial concentration). The Arrhenius equation k = Ae^(-Ea/RT) shows how the rate constant depends on temperature and activation energy. Collision theory provides a molecular-level explanation for chemical reactions.",

      "For a first-order reaction: k = (2.303/t) log([A]0/[A]t) and t1/2 = 0.693/k, independent of initial concentration.",
      "For a zero-order reaction: [A]t = [A]0 - kt and t1/2 = [A]0/(2k), dependent on initial concentration.",
      "Arrhenius equation: k = Ae^(-Ea/RT); a plot of ln k vs 1/T gives a straight line with slope = -Ea/R."

This is because the Arrhenius equation, which describes the temperature dependence of the rate constant k, is given by k = Ae^(-Ea/RT). Taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives ln k = -Ea/RT + ln A, so the slope of the ln k vs 1/T graph is -Ea/R. The answer format should be -Ea/R, not just Ea/R."
