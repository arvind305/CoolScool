    "text": "Surface chemistry deals with phenomena that occur at surfaces or interfaces. Adsorption is the accumulation of molecular species at a surface, distinct from absorption (bulk uptake). Physisorption involves weak van der Waals forces and is reversible, while chemisorption involves chemical bond formation and is often irreversible. The Freundlich adsorption isotherm relates the extent of adsorption to pressure. Catalysis involves substances that alter reaction rates without being consumed; it can be homogeneous (same phase as reactants) or heterogeneous (different phase). Enzyme catalysis is highly specific and follows the lock-and-key model. Colloids are heterogeneous systems with dispersed-phase particle sizes between 1-1000 nm. They are classified as lyophilic (solvent-loving) or lyophobic (solvent-fearing), and exhibit properties such as the Tyndall effect, Brownian motion, electrophoresis, and coagulation.",
    "rules": [
      "Physisorption is characterised by low enthalpy of adsorption (20-40 kJ/mol), is reversible, and occurs at low temperatures; chemisorption has high enthalpy (80-240 kJ/mol) and is specific.",
      "Freundlich adsorption isotherm: x/m = kP^(1/n), where x/m is the mass of adsorbate per mass of adsorbent, and 1/n is between 0 and 1.",
      "Coagulation of colloids occurs by adding electrolytes; the coagulating power is governed by the Hardy-Schulze rule (higher the valence of the coagulating ion, greater is its coagulating power)."

Electrolysis is the decomposition of a chemical compound due to passage of electric current. Dialysis is the process of separating molecules in a solution based on their ability to pass through a semipermeable membrane. Therefore, the correct answer is electrophoresis, which is the movement of colloidal particles under an electric field."

However, at very high temperatures, the chemisorption process can become less favorable and start to decrease due to the increased thermal motion and desorption of the adsorbate molecules.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement is incorrect because chemisorption does not always decrease at very high temperatures. Chemisorption involves the formation of chemical bonds between the adsorbate and the surface, and this process is generally favored at higher temperatures as it provides the necessary activation energy.

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is true solution (A), colloidal solution (B), and suspension (C) in increasing order of particle size. True solutions have the smallest dispersed particles, less than 1 nm, while colloids have larger dispersed particles between 1-1000 nm, and suspensions have the largest dispersed particles greater than 1000 nm.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be suspension (C), colloidal solution (B), and true solution (A). This is incorrect because suspensions have the largest dispersed particles, greater than 1000 nm, while colloidal solutions have intermediate-sized dispersed particles between 1-1000 nm, and true solutions have the smallest dispersed particles, less than 1 nm."
