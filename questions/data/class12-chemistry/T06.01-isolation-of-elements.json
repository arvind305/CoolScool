  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "The isolation of elements from their naturally occurring ores involves three main steps: concentration of the ore, extraction of the metal (reduction), and refining. Concentration methods include gravity separation, magnetic separation, froth flotation, and chemical leaching. The choice of reduction method depends on the thermodynamic stability of the metal oxide, as depicted by Ellingham diagrams. Carbon reduction is used for less reactive metals, while electrolytic reduction (Hall-Heroult process) is needed for highly reactive metals like aluminium. Refining methods include distillation, liquation, electrolytic refining, zone refining, and vapour phase refining (Mond process, van Arkel method). Key industrial extractions include aluminium (from bauxite), copper (from copper pyrites), zinc (from zinc blende), and iron (from haematite in a blast furnace).",
    "rules": [
      "In Ellingham diagrams, a metal can reduce the oxide of another metal if its line lies below the other metal's line (more negative delta G for oxide formation).",
      "Froth flotation is used for sulphide ores, where pine oil acts as a collector and creates a froth that carries the ore particles.",
      "In electrolytic refining, the impure metal is the anode, the pure metal is the cathode, and the electrolyte is a soluble salt of the metal."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "The process of heating an ore strongly in the absence of air to remove moisture and volatile impurities is called calcination. This process helps to concentrate the metal content in the ore by removing unwanted substances.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Roasting is the process of heating an ore in the presence of air to oxidize impurities and convert the ore into a purer form. Smelting is the process of extracting a metal from its ore by heating and melting it. Leaching is the process of selectively dissolving out desired components from an ore using a suitable solvent. None of these processes accurately describe the heating of an ore in the absence of air to remove moisture and volatile impurities, which is the definition of calcination."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "The froth flotation method is commonly used for the concentration of sulphide ores.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The froth flotation method is not commonly used for the concentration of oxide, carbonate, or halide ores. These ores are usually concentrated using other methods like gravity separation or magnetic separation, as they do not exhibit the same hydrophobic properties as sulphide ores which is the basis of the froth flotation process."

In fact, most metal oxide formation lines slope upward with temperature, meaning delta G becomes less negative (less favourable) at higher temperatures, so the oxides become LESS stable. This is because the entropy term (-T delta S) becomes more significant at higher temperatures, and the formation of oxides from metals and O2 generally involves a decrease in entropy (gases consumed), making the reaction less spontaneous at high temperatures.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Options A, B, and C are all correct statements about the Ellingham diagram. Most metal oxide lines do slope upward (option A). The C -> CO line slopes down due to entropy increase (option B). A lower line does indicate ability to reduce higher-line oxides (option C). Only option D is incorrect."

      "explanation_correct": "Aluminium is NOT extracted by carbon reduction. Al2O3 has an extremely negative delta G of formation (the Al2O3 line lies very low on the Ellingham diagram), making it too stable to be reduced by carbon at economically feasible temperatures. Instead, aluminium is extracted by electrolytic reduction of alumina dissolved in molten cryolite (Hall-Heroult process). Iron, zinc, and tin all have oxides that can be reduced by carbon or CO at achievable temperatures.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Iron (option A) is reduced by CO in the blast furnace. Zinc (option B) is reduced by heating ZnO with coke. Tin (option D) is reduced by heating SnO2 with carbon. Only aluminium requires electrolytic reduction because its oxide is too stable for carbon reduction."

      "explanation_correct": "In metallurgy, the flux must be chemically opposite to the gangue. When the gangue is basic (CaO or FeO), an acidic flux (SiO2) is added. The acid-base reaction between SiO2 and the basic gangue forms a fusible (low melting point) slag: CaO + SiO2 -> CaSiO3 or FeO + SiO2 -> FeSiO3. The slag is a liquid that floats on the molten metal and can be easily tapped off, effectively removing the impurity from the metal.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "SiO2 does not reduce anything (options A and C) — it is an oxide, not a reducing agent. SiO2 actually decreases the melting point of the mixture by forming slag (option D is wrong). The purpose is to form a fusible slag by acid-base reaction with the gangue."

      "explanation_correct": "For the reaction 2C(s) + O2(g) -> 2CO(g), the number of moles of gas increases from 1 to 2, giving a positive entropy change (delta S > 0). Since delta G = delta H - T delta S, a positive delta S means that as temperature increases, the T delta S term becomes more negative, making delta G more negative. This causes the 2C + O2 -> 2CO line to slope downward on the Ellingham diagram. At higher temperatures, this line crosses below the lines of many metal oxides, meaning carbon can reduce them. This is the fundamental thermodynamic reason why coke works as a reducing agent in blast furnaces at high temperatures.",

      "explanation_correct": "Pure alumina (Al2O3) melts at approximately 2072°C, which would require impractically high energy input and cause severe engineering challenges. Dissolving alumina in molten cryolite (Na3AlF6) lowers the working temperature to about 1000°C, making the electrolysis economically feasible. Additionally, the cryolite-alumina melt has better electrical conductivity than pure molten alumina, allowing current to flow more efficiently. This is why the Hall-Heroult process is practical for industrial-scale aluminium production.",
