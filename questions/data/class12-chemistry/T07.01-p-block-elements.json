    "text": "The p-block elements of Groups 15 to 18 show a wide range of properties. Group 15 (nitrogen family) elements show oxidation states from -3 to +5; nitrogen forms multiple oxides and important compounds like ammonia and nitric acid. Group 16 (oxygen family) includes oxygen and sulphur, with sulphuric acid being a key industrial chemical produced by the Contact process. Group 17 (halogens) are highly reactive non-metals that form interhalogen compounds and various oxoacids. Group 18 (noble gases) are generally unreactive but xenon forms compounds with fluorine (XeF2, XeF4, XeF6) and oxygen. Key industrial processes include the Ostwald process (HNO3), Contact process (H2SO4), and preparation of chlorine and HCl.",
    "rules": [
      "Nitrogen exhibits oxidation states from -3 to +5; the stability of +5 oxidation state decreases down the group while +3 becomes more stable (inert pair effect).",
      "Sulphuric acid is prepared by the Contact process: 2SO2 + O2 -> 2SO3 (V2O5 catalyst), followed by dissolution in H2SO4 to form oleum, then dilution.",
      "Xenon fluorides have specific geometries: XeF2 is linear, XeF4 is square planar, XeF6 is distorted octahedral, based on VSEPR theory."

While +5 is a possible oxidation state for some Group 15 elements like phosphorus, nitrogen can also exhibit the -3 oxidation state in compounds like ammonia (NH3). Therefore, the correct answer is option D, which includes both -3 and +3 as the common oxidation states for the Group 15 elements."

Option C is incorrect because the presence or absence of lone pairs on the central atom is not the reason for the difference in bond angles between H2O and H2S.

This is because the central oxygen atom has a trigonal planar molecular geometry, with three bonding pairs of electrons arranged in a flat, 120° arrangement.
