    "text": "The p-block elements of Groups 15 to 18 show a wide range of properties. Group 15 (nitrogen family) elements show oxidation states from -3 to +5; nitrogen forms multiple oxides and important compounds like ammonia and nitric acid. Group 16 (oxygen family) includes oxygen and sulphur, with sulphuric acid being a key industrial chemical produced by the Contact process. Group 17 (halogens) are highly reactive non-metals that form interhalogen compounds and various oxoacids. Group 18 (noble gases) are generally unreactive but xenon forms compounds with fluorine (XeF2, XeF4, XeF6) and oxygen. Key industrial processes include the Ostwald process (HNO3), Contact process (H2SO4), and preparation of chlorine and HCl.",
    "rules": [
      "Nitrogen exhibits oxidation states from -3 to +5; the stability of +5 oxidation state decreases down the group while +3 becomes more stable (inert pair effect).",
      "Sulphuric acid is prepared by the Contact process: 2SO2 + O2 -> 2SO3 (V2O5 catalyst), followed by dissolution in H2SO4 to form oleum, then dilution.",
      "Xenon fluorides have specific geometries: XeF2 is linear, XeF4 is square planar, XeF6 is distorted octahedral, based on VSEPR theory."

      "explanation_correct": "The common oxidation states exhibited by Group 15 elements (nitrogen family) are -3 and +3, which makes option D the correct answer. This is because the Group 15 elements have 5 valence electrons and can form compounds with oxidation states ranging from -3 to +5.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A, +5, is not the common oxidation state exhibited by all Group 15 elements. While +5 is a possible oxidation state for some Group 15 elements like phosphorus, nitrogen can also exhibit the -3 oxidation state in compounds like ammonia (NH3). Therefore, the correct answer is option D, which includes both -3 and +3 as the common oxidation states for the Group 15 elements."

With progressively more water, further hydrolysis leads to XeO2F2 and ultimately, with excess water, complete hydrolysis yields XeO3 (xenon trioxide): XeF6 + 3H2O -> XeO3 + 6HF.

      "explanation_correct": "The reducing power of Group 16 hydrides generally increases down the group (H2O < H2S < H2Se < H2Te) because the bond dissociation energy of the E-H bond decreases, making it easier to release hydrogen.

Bismuth (period 6) has a very large atomic radius, and the overlap between its diffuse 6p orbitals and the compact 1s orbital of hydrogen is extremely poor. This results in a very weak Bi-H bond with low bond dissociation energy, making BiH3 thermally unstable — it decomposes even at room temperature. In contrast, NH3 has excellent N-H orbital overlap due to nitrogen's small size, giving it very strong bonds and high stability.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Although fluorine is highly electronegative, the H-F bond is exceptionally strong (bond dissociation energy approximately 568 kJ/mol) because fluorine is very small and forms a short, strong bond with hydrogen. In aqueous solution, the high energy required to break this bond outweighs the favourable hydration enthalpy of F-, resulting in incomplete dissociation. This makes HF a weak acid (Ka = 3.5 x 10^-4), while HCl, HBr, and HI with progressively weaker H-X bonds are all strong acids.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is misleading — the small size of F- actually leads to a high hydration enthalpy, which would favour dissociation, not oppose it.

Fluorine provides this because: (i) the F-F bond dissociation energy is very low (159 kJ/mol), meaning F atoms are easily generated, and (ii) fluorine has the highest electronegativity of any element, forming strong Xe-F bonds that release enough energy to compensate for the promotion energy needed to excite xenon's electrons into bonding orbitals.
