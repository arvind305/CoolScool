    "text": "The d-block elements (transition metals) occupy the central portion of the periodic table and have partially filled d-orbitals. They exhibit characteristic properties such as variable oxidation states, formation of coloured compounds, catalytic activity, tendency to form complexes, and magnetic properties. The 3d series runs from Sc (Z=21) to Zn (Z=30). Important compounds include KMnO4 (potassium permanganate, a powerful oxidising agent) and K2Cr2O7 (potassium dichromate, used in titrations). The f-block elements include the lanthanoids (4f) and actinoids (5f). Lanthanoids commonly show +3 oxidation state and exhibit lanthanoid contraction (a gradual decrease in atomic and ionic radii across the series due to poor shielding by 4f electrons). Actinoids show a greater range of oxidation states and many are radioactive.",
    "rules": [
      "Transition metals show variable oxidation states because the energy difference between (n-1)d and ns orbitals is small; the maximum oxidation state increases up to Mn (+7) and then decreases.",
      "Lanthanoid contraction is the progressive decrease in size across the lanthanoid series due to poor shielding by 4f electrons; it affects the chemistry of the third transition series.",
      "KMnO4 in acidic medium acts as a strong oxidising agent: MnO4- + 8H+ + 5e- -> Mn2+ + 4H2O (E° = +1.51 V)."

This is because the 4f electrons provide poor shielding, allowing the increased nuclear charge to pull the electrons closer to the nucleus.

As the 4f orbitals are filled, the increasing nuclear charge is not adequately shielded, leading to a gradual decrease in the atomic and ionic radii across the lanthanoid series.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The lanthanoid contraction is not caused by poor shielding of the 3d electrons, as the 3d series ends at zinc (Z=30) before the lanthanoids begin. Additionally, the increase in electron-electron repulsion or relativistic effects alone do not fully explain the lanthanoid contraction. The key reason is the ineffective shielding of the nuclear charge by the 4f electrons, which leads to the gradual decrease in size across the lanthanoid series."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement is incorrect because in basic solution, CrO4^2- is the stable form, while in acidic solution, the equilibrium shifts towards Cr2O7^2-.

This is because the gradual decrease in atomic radii across the lanthanoid series affects the shielding of the outer electrons in the later transition metals, leading to their similar sizes.",

Lanthanoid contraction refers to the gradual decrease in atomic and ionic radii of the lanthanoid elements (4f series) as you move across the series. This does not directly affect the atomic radii of the second and third row transition metals (4d and 5d series). The similar atomic radii of the 4d and 5d transition metals are due to the poor shielding of the 4f and 5f electrons, which causes the effective nuclear charge to increase, leading to a contraction in atomic size."

This is why all lanthanoids predominantly show +3 oxidation state and similar chemical behavior.",
