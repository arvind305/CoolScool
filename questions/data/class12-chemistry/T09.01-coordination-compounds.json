    "text": "Coordination compounds contain a central metal atom or ion bonded to a set of molecules or ions called ligands. Werner's theory established the concepts of primary and secondary valencies. Ligands can be monodentate (one donor atom), bidentate (two donor atoms, e.g., ethylenediamine), or polydentate (e.g., EDTA with six donor atoms). IUPAC nomenclature follows specific rules for naming coordination compounds. Isomerism includes structural isomerism (ionisation, linkage) and stereoisomerism (geometrical/cis-trans and optical). Bonding in coordination compounds is explained by Valence Bond Theory (VBT) and Crystal Field Theory (CFT). CFT explains the splitting of d-orbitals in octahedral (t2g and eg) and tetrahedral fields, with crystal field stabilisation energy (CFSE) determining stability, colour, and magnetic properties. Coordination compounds are important in biological systems (haemoglobin, chlorophyll, vitamin B12), analytical chemistry, and extraction of metals.",
    "rules": [
      "In octahedral crystal field splitting, the d-orbitals split into lower energy t2g (dxy, dxz, dyz) and higher energy eg (dx2-y2, dz2) sets, with splitting energy = delta_o.",
      "In tetrahedral splitting, delta_t = (4/9)delta_o, and the splitting is inverted compared to octahedral.",
      "Strong field ligands (e.g., CN-, CO) cause large splitting and pair electrons (low spin), while weak field ligands (e.g., I-, Br-, Cl-) cause small splitting and leave electrons unpaired (high spin)."

      "explanation_correct": "The color of coordination compounds is due to d-d electronic transitions, where the electrons in the d-orbitals of the metal atom/ion absorb specific wavelengths of visible light, leading to the observed color. This is because the splitting of the d-orbitals in the crystal field causes these electronic transitions.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The color of coordination compounds is not due to charge transfer alone, as that would involve the transfer of electrons between the metal and ligands. It is also not due to the emission of UV light, as the compounds absorb specific wavelengths of visible light. The color is also not due to the reflection of all wavelengths, as that would result in a white or colorless appearance."

      "explanation_correct": "The order of increasing number of unpaired electrons for the given octahedral complexes of Co3+ (d6) is A, B, C. This is because the strong-field ligands CN- and NH3 in complexes A and B, respectively, cause a larger crystal field splitting and greater pairing of electrons, resulting in fewer unpaired electrons compared to the weak-field ligand F- in complex C.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be C, B, A. This is because the weak-field ligand F- in complex C results in a smaller crystal field splitting, leading to more unpaired electrons compared to the strong-field ligands CN- and NH3 in complexes A and B, respectively. The number of unpaired electrons decreases from C to B to A."
