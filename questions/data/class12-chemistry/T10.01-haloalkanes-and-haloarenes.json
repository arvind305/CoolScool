  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Haloalkanes (alkyl halides) and haloarenes (aryl halides) are compounds containing carbon-halogen bonds. Haloalkanes are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary based on the carbon bearing the halogen. They undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions via SN1 (unimolecular, via carbocation, racemisation) or SN2 (bimolecular, backside attack, Walden inversion) mechanisms. Elimination reactions (dehydrohalogenation) follow Saytzeff's rule to give the most substituted alkene. Haloarenes are less reactive towards nucleophilic substitution due to resonance stabilisation of the C-X bond but undergo electrophilic aromatic substitution where the halogen is ortho/para directing but deactivating. Important polyhalogen compounds include chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, DDT, and freons.",
    "rules": [
      "SN2 reactions follow second-order kinetics, proceed with inversion of configuration (Walden inversion), and are favoured by primary substrates and strong nucleophiles.",
      "SN1 reactions follow first-order kinetics, proceed through a carbocation intermediate with racemisation, and are favoured by tertiary substrates.",
      "Haloarenes are less reactive than haloalkanes towards nucleophilic substitution because the C-X bond has partial double bond character due to resonance."

The order of reactivity towards SN1 is determined by the ease of formation of the carbocation intermediate, which is inversely proportional to the bond strength of the C-X bond.
