  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Haloalkanes (alkyl halides) and haloarenes (aryl halides) are compounds containing carbon-halogen bonds. Haloalkanes are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary based on the carbon bearing the halogen. They undergo nucleophilic substitution reactions via SN1 (unimolecular, via carbocation, racemisation) or SN2 (bimolecular, backside attack, Walden inversion) mechanisms. Elimination reactions (dehydrohalogenation) follow Saytzeff's rule to give the most substituted alkene. Haloarenes are less reactive towards nucleophilic substitution due to resonance stabilisation of the C-X bond but undergo electrophilic aromatic substitution where the halogen is ortho/para directing but deactivating. Important polyhalogen compounds include chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, DDT, and freons.",
    "rules": [
      "SN2 reactions follow second-order kinetics, proceed with inversion of configuration (Walden inversion), and are favoured by primary substrates and strong nucleophiles.",
      "SN1 reactions follow first-order kinetics, proceed through a carbocation intermediate with racemisation, and are favoured by tertiary substrates.",
      "Haloarenes are less reactive than haloalkanes towards nucleophilic substitution because the C-X bond has partial double bond character due to resonance."

      "explanation_correct": "The order of increasing reactivity towards SN2 reaction is A, B, C, D. This is because as the number of alkyl groups (R) attached to the carbon bearing the halogen increases, the carbon becomes more sterically hindered, making it less accessible for nucleophilic attack. Hence, the primary halide (CH3Br) is the most reactive, followed by the secondary (CH3CH2Br), then the tertiary ((CH3)2CHBr), and finally the most sterically hindered tertiary ((CH3)3CBr).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be A, C, B, D. This is because the reasoning is based on the stability of the resulting carbocation intermediate, with the more substituted carbocations being more stable. However, in SN2 reactions, the steric hindrance around the carbon bearing the halogen is the primary factor determining reactivity, not the stability of the carbocation."

      "explanation_correct": "The presence of strong electron-withdrawing groups such as -NO2 at ortho and para positions greatly activates haloarenes towards nucleophilic aromatic substitution. These groups stabilise the negative charge in the Meisenheimer complex (the anionic intermediate), dramatically lowering the activation energy. For example, 2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene reacts readily with nucleophiles under mild conditions, which is a well-known exception to the general unreactivity of haloarenes.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Electron-donating groups like -CH3 (option A) would destabilise the Meisenheimer complex and make nucleophilic substitution even harder.

      "explanation_correct": "If boiling points followed electronegativity, CH3F should have the highest boiling point since fluorine is the most electronegative halogen. Instead, CH3F has the lowest boiling point among halomethanes. This is because boiling point is primarily governed by molecular mass and the strength of van der Waals (London dispersion) forces, which increase with the size and polarisability of the halogen atom. Thus CH3I > CH3Br > CH3Cl > CH3F in boiling point order, opposite to the electronegativity trend.",

Option D is wrong because CH3I, not CH3Cl, has the highest boiling point due to the larger, more polarisable iodine atom."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because bond strength alone does not determine mechanism preference; steric and electronic factors are the primary determinants. Option C is wrong because tert-butyl bromide is soluble in polar protic solvents which actually favour SN1. Option D is incorrect because bromide is a good leaving group in both SN1 and SN2; the issue is steric blockage of the SN2 transition state."

      "explanation_correct": "Halogens exhibit a dual electronic effect: their lone pairs participate in resonance (+M effect), donating electron density specifically to the ortho and para positions, which makes these positions preferentially attacked by electrophiles. However, the strong electronegativity of the halogen produces a powerful electron-withdrawing inductive effect (-I effect) that reduces the overall electron density of the ring. Since the -I effect > +M effect in terms of overall ring activation, the ring is deactivated, but the directional resonance donation still controls the regiochemistry.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option B is incorrect because directing effects are electronic, not physical/steric.

As NaCl precipitates out of the reaction mixture, it is effectively removed from the equilibrium. By Le Chatelier's principle, the equilibrium shifts to produce more product (RI + NaCl), continuously driving the reaction forward to completion. This is a classic example of using solubility differences to control reaction equilibrium.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because acetone is a polar aprotic solvent, not a polar protic solvent, and the key factor is NaCl insolubility rather than solvation of iodide. Option C is incorrect because the C-I bond is actually weaker than the C-Cl bond (C-I ~234 kJ/mol vs C-Cl ~339 kJ/mol).
