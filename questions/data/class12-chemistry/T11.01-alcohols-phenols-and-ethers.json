    "text": "Alcohols contain a hydroxyl (-OH) group bonded to an sp3 hybridised carbon. They are classified as primary, secondary, or tertiary based on the carbon bearing the OH group. Key reactions include dehydration to alkenes, oxidation to aldehydes/ketones/carboxylic acids, and esterification. Phenols have the OH group directly attached to a benzene ring and are more acidic than alcohols due to resonance stabilisation of the phenoxide ion. Phenols undergo electrophilic substitution (nitration, halogenation, Kolbe reaction, Reimer-Tiemann reaction) easily because OH is a strong activating group. Ethers have two organic groups bonded to oxygen (R-O-R') and are prepared by Williamson synthesis (reaction of alkoxide with alkyl halide). Ethers are cleaved by HI, and electrophilic substitution of anisole occurs preferentially at the ortho and para positions.",
    "rules": [
      "Acidity order: water > phenol > alcohol; phenol is acidic due to resonance stabilisation of phenoxide ion but does not react with NaHCO3.",
      "Lucas test distinguishes 1°, 2°, and 3° alcohols: 3° gives immediate turbidity, 2° gives turbidity within 5 minutes, 1° requires heating.",
      "Williamson synthesis: R-O-Na + R'-X -> R-O-R' + NaX; works best with primary alkyl halides to avoid elimination side reactions."

This results in higher boiling points for alcohols.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The higher boiling point of alcohols compared to alkanes is not due to their higher molecular weight, ionic character, or van der Waals forces alone. While these factors can contribute to boiling point differences, the key reason is the formation of intermolecular hydrogen bonds between the hydroxyl groups in alcohols. This hydrogen bonding requires more energy to overcome, leading to the higher boiling points observed for alcohols."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order of increasing boiling point is C (pentane), A (diethyl ether), B (butan-1-ol). This is because pentane, being a non-polar alkane, has the weakest intermolecular forces and hence the lowest boiling point. Diethyl ether is a polar ether with moderate intermolecular forces, while butan-1-ol is a polar alcohol with strong hydrogen bonding, resulting in the highest boiling point.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "An incorrect reasoning would be to assume that the boiling point order depends only on the number of carbon atoms, with longer chains having higher boiling points. While this is generally true, it does not account for the effects of polarity and hydrogen bonding. The presence of the -OH group in butan-1-ol results in stronger intermolecular forces compared to the non-polar pentane and the moderately polar diethyl ether, leading to the highest boiling point for butan-1-ol."

While ethers can accept hydrogen bonds from other molecules, they cannot donate them, resulting in much lower boiling points than alcohols of similar mass.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The boiling point difference is not due to polarity alone. Ethers are polar molecules but cannot form hydrogen bonds with themselves because they lack an O-H bond. Alcohols form extensive hydrogen bonding networks through their -OH groups, which dramatically increases their boiling points. This is why ethanol (46 g/mol, bp 78°C) has a much higher boiling point than dimethyl ether (46 g/mol, bp -24°C)."

The oxygen in -OH has a lone pair that can donate electrons directly to the ring through resonance. While -OCH3 also activates through resonance, the methyl group is electron-withdrawing by induction, slightly reducing the electron-donating ability compared to -OH.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Both -OH and -OCH3 are ortho/para directing activating groups, but they differ in strength. The -OH group is a stronger activator because it has greater electron-donating ability through resonance. In -OCH3, the methyl group has a small electron-withdrawing inductive effect that partially counteracts the electron donation by resonance. This is why phenol reacts with bromine water without a catalyst to give 2,4,6-tribromophenol instantaneously."

In the Lucas test, tertiary alcohols give immediate turbidity, secondary alcohols give turbidity within 5-10 minutes at room temperature, and primary alcohols show no turbidity at room temperature (requiring heating). Since turbidity appeared within 5 minutes, this indicates a secondary alcohol that forms a moderately stable secondary carbocation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Primary alcohols do not react with Lucas reagent at room temperature and require heating for turbidity to appear. Tertiary alcohols react immediately (within seconds) due to highly stable tertiary carbocations. The 5-minute timeframe is characteristic of secondary alcohols, which form secondary carbocations that are moderately stable - stable enough to react at room temperature but not as quickly as tertiary alcohols."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "The correct order of increasing acidity is p-Cresol < Phenol < p-Nitrophenol. The methyl group in p-cresol is electron-donating, destabilizing the phenoxide ion and reducing acidity. Phenol has moderate acidity. The nitro group in p-nitrophenol is electron-withdrawing, stabilizing the phenoxide ion through both resonance and inductive effects, making it the most acidic.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Acidity depends on the stability of the conjugate base (phenoxide ion). Electron-donating groups like -CH3 destabilize the negative charge, decreasing acidity. Electron-withdrawing groups like -NO2 stabilize the negative charge, increasing acidity. Therefore, p-cresol with its electron-donating methyl group is least acidic, while p-nitrophenol with its electron-withdrawing nitro group is most acidic."

They resist oxidation by common oxidizing agents like K2Cr2O7, KMnO4, or PCC because the carbon bearing the -OH group has no hydrogen atom attached. Oxidation of alcohols requires removal of a hydrogen from this carbon, which is impossible in tertiary alcohols. Under vigorous conditions, C-C bond cleavage may occur instead.",

For an acid to liberate CO2 from NaHCO3, it must be stronger than H2CO3 to protonate it. Phenol reacts with strong bases like NaOH to form sodium phenoxide, but not with weak bases like NaHCO3. This is a key test to distinguish phenols from carboxylic acids.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "This is a common misconception. While phenol is acidic enough to react with NaOH, it is not acidic enough to protonate the bicarbonate ion and liberate CO2. Carboxylic acids (pKa ~4-5) are stronger acids than carbonic acid (pKa ~6.4), so they react with NaHCO3. Phenol (pKa ~10) is weaker than carbonic acid, so it cannot displace CO2 from bicarbonate. This exception helps distinguish phenols from carboxylic acids."

      "explanation_correct": "The exception is that secondary and especially tertiary alkyl halides predominantly undergo elimination (E2) rather than substitution (SN2) when treated with alkoxide ions. This is because alkoxide is a strong base, and secondary/tertiary halides are prone to elimination. Therefore, Williamson synthesis works best with primary alkyl halides. To prepare ethers with tertiary groups, the tertiary alkoxide must be used with a primary halide.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Primary alkoxides work perfectly well in Williamson synthesis. Aromatic alkoxides (like sodium phenoxide) can also participate effectively. Methyl halides are actually the most reactive in SN2 reactions. The key exception is that secondary and tertiary alkyl halides favor elimination over substitution when treated with strong bases like alkoxides, giving alkenes instead of ethers. This is why the choice of which component is the alkoxide and which is the halide matters significantly."

This stabilization lowers the activation energy for carbocation formation, making the reaction rapid at room temperature. Primary alcohols form very unstable primary carbocations, requiring heat to overcome the high activation energy barrier.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Solubility, molecular weight, and hydrogen bonding are not the primary factors. The reaction mechanism involves carbocation formation as the rate-determining step. Tertiary carbocations (R3C+) are stabilized by electron donation from three alkyl groups through hyperconjugation and inductive effects. Primary carbocations (RCH2+) have minimal stabilization, making them high-energy intermediates. This energy difference explains the dramatic reactivity difference in the Lucas test."

The oxygen's lone pairs delocalize into the ring, increasing electron density especially at ortho and para positions. This makes the ring more nucleophilic and highly reactive toward electrophiles. That's why phenol reacts with bromine water without a catalyst, while benzene requires a Lewis acid catalyst.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The -OH group is electron-donating through resonance, not electron-withdrawing. Molecular weight and acidity are irrelevant to electrophilic substitution reactivity. The key reason is resonance: oxygen's lone pair participates in resonance structures that place negative charge on the ring (especially ortho/para positions), significantly increasing electron density. This activation is so strong that phenol can react with weak electrophiles that would not react with benzene."

      "explanation_correct": "HI cleaves ethers effectively because it combines two favorable factors: (1) HI is a strong acid that protonates the ether oxygen, making it a better leaving group, and (2) I- is an excellent nucleophile due to its large size and polarizability, allowing it to attack the carbon and displace the alcohol. Although HCl is also acidic, Cl- is a much poorer nucleophile than I-, making the cleavage very slow.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "HI is actually a stronger acid than HCl, not weaker. However, acidity alone doesn't explain ether cleavage. The mechanism requires both protonation of oxygen (needs strong acid) and nucleophilic attack (needs good nucleophile). I- is a superior nucleophile compared to Cl- because it is larger, more polarizable, and less electronegative. This makes I- much better at attacking electrophilic carbon. Solubility is not a significant factor in this reaction."
