    "text": "Aldehydes (R-CHO) and ketones (R-CO-R') contain the carbonyl group (C=O) which undergoes nucleophilic addition reactions. Aldehydes are more reactive than ketones towards nucleophilic addition due to less steric hindrance and greater electrophilicity. Key reactions include addition of HCN, Grignard reagents, and alcohols (acetal formation), as well as reactions with nitrogen nucleophiles to form oximes, hydrazones, and semicarbazones. Aldol condensation occurs between two molecules of an aldehyde or ketone having alpha-hydrogen. The Cannizzaro reaction is a disproportionation of aldehydes without alpha-hydrogen. Carboxylic acids (R-COOH) are acidic due to resonance stabilisation of the carboxylate ion. Their acidity is affected by the nature of substituents (electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity). Important reactions include esterification, formation of acid derivatives, and the Hell-Volhard-Zelinsky reaction.",
    "rules": [
      "Aldehydes give positive Tollens' test (silver mirror) and Fehling's test (red precipitate of Cu2O); ketones do not.",
      "Aldol condensation requires at least one alpha-hydrogen: 2CH3CHO -> CH3CH(OH)CH2CHO (aldol), which on heating loses water to give CH3CH=CHCHO.",
      "Acidity of carboxylic acids: electron-withdrawing groups increase acidity (e.g., Cl-CH2COOH > CH3COOH); electron-donating groups decrease it."

An ortho-substituent is much closer to the -COOH group and therefore exerts a far stronger inductive (and steric/field) effect on the acidity than a para-substituent. As a result, ortho-bromobenzoic acid (pKa ~ 2.85) is a stronger acid than para-chlorobenzoic acid (pKa ~ 3.98), despite Cl being more electronegative than Br.

Benzaldehyde (C6H5CHO) has no hydrogen on the carbon adjacent to the carbonyl (the adjacent carbon is part of the aromatic ring and its hydrogens are vinylic, not alpha). Without an alpha-hydrogen, enolate formation is impossible, and the alternate pathway -- the Cannizzaro reaction (disproportionation into benzyl alcohol and sodium benzoate) -- occurs.",

When a carboxylic acid loses a proton, the resulting carboxylate ion (RCOO-) has two equivalent resonance structures in which the negative charge is equally distributed over both oxygen atoms. This extensive delocalisation greatly stabilises the conjugate base and shifts the equilibrium towards ionisation. In contrast, the alkoxide ion (RO-) formed from an alcohol has the negative charge localised on a single oxygen with no resonance stabilisation, making it far less stable and the alcohol a much weaker acid.",
