    "text": "Amines are derivatives of ammonia in which one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced by alkyl or aryl groups. They are classified as primary (RNH2), secondary (R2NH), and tertiary (R3N). Amines are basic because the lone pair on nitrogen can accept a proton. The basicity of aliphatic amines is generally greater than that of aromatic amines because the lone pair in aniline is delocalised into the benzene ring. Key preparation methods include reduction of nitro compounds, ammonolysis of alkyl halides, Gabriel phthalimide synthesis, and Hoffmann bromamide degradation. Diazonium salts (ArN2+X-) are prepared from primary aromatic amines by treatment with NaNO2/HCl at 0-5 degrees C and are versatile intermediates for synthesising various aromatic compounds through Sandmeyer and related reactions.",
    "rules": [
      "Basicity order in aqueous solution: secondary aliphatic > primary aliphatic > tertiary aliphatic > NH3 > aniline (due to balance of inductive effect, solvation, and steric effects).",
      "Gabriel phthalimide synthesis is used to prepare primary amines only; it cannot prepare secondary or tertiary amines.",
      "Diazonium salts undergo coupling reactions with phenols (in alkaline medium) and amines to form brightly coloured azo compounds used as dyes."

      "explanation_correct": "The order of increasing boiling point is: Trimethylamine (A) < Ethylamine (B) < Propylamine (D) < Diethylamine (C). This is because as the molecular weight and number of carbon atoms increases, the boiling point also increases due to stronger intermolecular forces.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be A, B, C, D. This is because the boiling point does not solely depend on the number of carbon atoms. Branching and the presence of electronegative atoms like nitrogen also affect the intermolecular forces and hence the boiling point. Trimethylamine (A) has the lowest boiling point due to its compact structure and lack of long alkyl chains, while Diethylamine (C) has the highest boiling point due to stronger intermolecular forces between the larger ethyl groups."

This is because iodine has the lowest electronegativity, followed by bromine, chlorine, and fluorine has the highest electronegativity.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to arrange the reactions in the order A, B, C, D. This is because the Sandmeyer reaction with CuCl/HCl introduces chlorine, which has a higher electronegativity than the bromine introduced in the Sandmeyer reaction with CuBr/HBr. The Balz-Schiemann reaction introduces fluorine, which has the highest electronegativity, and the reaction with KI introduces iodine, which has the lowest electronegativity."
