    "text": "Amines are derivatives of ammonia in which one or more hydrogen atoms are replaced by alkyl or aryl groups. They are classified as primary (RNH2), secondary (R2NH), and tertiary (R3N). Amines are basic because the lone pair on nitrogen can accept a proton. The basicity of aliphatic amines is generally greater than that of aromatic amines because the lone pair in aniline is delocalised into the benzene ring. Key preparation methods include reduction of nitro compounds, ammonolysis of alkyl halides, Gabriel phthalimide synthesis, and Hoffmann bromamide degradation. Diazonium salts (ArN2+X-) are prepared from primary aromatic amines by treatment with NaNO2/HCl at 0-5 degrees C and are versatile intermediates for synthesising various aromatic compounds through Sandmeyer and related reactions.",
    "rules": [
      "Basicity order in aqueous solution: secondary aliphatic > primary aliphatic > tertiary aliphatic > NH3 > aniline (due to balance of inductive effect, solvation, and steric effects).",
      "Gabriel phthalimide synthesis is used to prepare primary amines only; it cannot prepare secondary or tertiary amines.",
      "Diazonium salts undergo coupling reactions with phenols (in alkaline medium) and amines to form brightly coloured azo compounds used as dyes."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Aniline is highly susceptible to oxidation by the nitrating mixture. Arjun should first protect the amino group by acetylation to form acetanilide. This reduces the activating effect and prevents oxidation while directing nitration to the para position. After nitration, the acetyl group is removed by hydrolysis to regenerate the amino group, yielding p-nitroaniline.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is B. Direct nitration (option A) would oxidise aniline and give a complex mixture with excessive ring substitution. Converting to diazonium salt (option C) is not done before nitration—diazonium salts are used for substitution reactions, not electrophilic aromatic substitution. Dissolving in NaOH (option D) would not protect the amino group from oxidation. Only acetylation provides the necessary protection while controlling the reaction."

The alkaline conditions convert the phenol to the more reactive phenoxide ion, which is a stronger nucleophile for the electrophilic diazonium cation, facilitating the coupling reaction to form the coloured azo compound.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is C. In strongly acidic medium (option A), phenol would not be deprotonated to form the reactive phenoxide nucleophile, and the coupling would be very slow or not occur. Neutral medium (option B) is also not optimal as phenoxide formation is favoured in base. Pure organic solvent (option D) is impractical as both the diazonium salt and phenoxide need to be in solution, which requires an aqueous component."

This is because the three bulky methyl groups cause steric hindrance to protonation and significantly reduce the solvation (stabilisation) of the trimethylammonium ion by water molecules, making the protonated form less stable.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is C. Methylamine and dimethylamine (options A and B) follow the expected trend of increasing basicity with methyl substitution due to the +I effect. The order in aqueous solution is (CH3)2NH > CH3NH2 > (CH3)3N > NH3, where trimethylamine breaks the expected pattern. Option D is incorrect because trimethylamine does show exceptional behaviour as an exception to the simple +I effect prediction."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "This is not truly contradictory but often confuses students. The lone pair on nitrogen in aniline is delocalised into the ring, reducing its availability for protonation (lower basicity). However, this same delocalisation increases electron density in the benzene ring, particularly at ortho and para positions, making the ring highly activated for electrophilic aromatic substitution. The effect operates in different directions for different properties.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is B. The amino group is electron-donating, not withdrawing (option A is wrong). Aniline is actually highly reactive towards electrophilic substitution (option C is factually incorrect). The direction of electron flow is from nitrogen to the ring, not ring to nitrogen (option D reverses it). The key insight is that the same lone pair delocalisation decreases basicity but increases ring reactivity—seemingly opposite effects from the same electronic phenomenon."

The aromatic ring can delocalise positive charge through resonance, stabilising the diazonium cation. This resonance stabilisation is not available to aliphatic diazonium salts, which decompose immediately. Combined with low temperature (0-5°C), this allows aromatic diazonium salts to be isolated and used in synthesis.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is B. The halide counterion (option A) is present in both aromatic and aliphatic diazonium salts but doesn't explain the stability difference. Ionic bonding strength (option C) doesn't distinguish aromatic from aliphatic diazonium salts. Hydrogen bonding with water (option D) would not stabilise a cationic species and is not the key factor. Only resonance stabilisation by the aromatic ring explains why aromatic diazonium salts are stable enough to isolate while aliphatic ones are not."

In ethylamine (aliphatic amine), the lone pair is localised on nitrogen and readily available. In aniline, the lone pair is delocalised through resonance into the benzene ring, making it less available for accepting a proton, thus reducing basicity.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is B. Molecular mass (option A) does not determine basicity—it's about electron availability. Ethylamine is aliphatic, not aromatic (option C is factually wrong). While aniline does have an electron-donating -NH2 group (option D), this doesn't explain why it's a weaker base than ethylamine. The key reason is the difference in lone pair localisation: localised in ethylamine (more basic) versus delocalised in aniline (less basic)."

It withdraws electron density from the benzene ring and the nitrogen atom through both inductive effect (-I) and mesomeric effect (-M). This further reduces the already limited availability of the nitrogen lone pair for protonation, making p-nitroaniline significantly less basic than aniline.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is B. The nitro group is electron-withdrawing, not electron-donating (option A is wrong—it shows -I and -M effects, not +I). Molecular weight (option C) is irrelevant to basicity. The nitro group decreases, not increases, lone pair availability (option D is opposite to reality).

This versatility makes them invaluable intermediates for introducing substituents that cannot be easily introduced by direct electrophilic substitution.",

Molecular weight (option B) is irrelevant to their role in synthesis. Cost (option D) is not the determining factor.
