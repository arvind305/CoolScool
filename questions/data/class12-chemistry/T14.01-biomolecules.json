    "text": "Biomolecules are organic molecules essential for life. Carbohydrates are polyhydroxy aldehydes or ketones classified as monosaccharides (glucose, fructose), disaccharides (sucrose, maltose, lactose), and polysaccharides (starch, cellulose, glycogen). Glucose has both open-chain and cyclic (alpha and beta) structures. Proteins are polymers of amino acids linked by peptide bonds (-CO-NH-), with four levels of structural organisation (primary through quaternary). Denaturation disrupts the higher-order structure of proteins. Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) are polynucleotides consisting of a sugar, phosphate, and nitrogenous base. DNA stores genetic information in a double helix, while RNA assists in protein synthesis. Enzymes are biological catalysts with high specificity, working at optimal temperature and pH. Vitamins are classified as water-soluble (B, C) and fat-soluble (A, D, E, K).",
    "rules": [
      "Glucose is an aldohexose (C6H12O6) that exists in cyclic forms (alpha-D-glucose and beta-D-glucose) differing in the position of the -OH group at the anomeric carbon (C1).",
      "The peptide bond is formed by condensation between the -COOH of one amino acid and the -NH2 of another, with loss of water.",
      "DNA has deoxyribose sugar and bases A, T, G, C paired as A=T and G triple-bond C; RNA has ribose sugar and bases A, U, G, C."

Vitamin B is important for energy metabolism, vitamin C is an antioxidant, and vitamin K is essential for blood clotting. Night blindness is specifically caused by a lack of vitamin A, which is necessary for the proper functioning of the retina in the eye."
