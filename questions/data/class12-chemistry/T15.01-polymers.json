    "text": "Polymers are large macromolecules formed by the repetitive bonding of smaller units called monomers. They are classified by source (natural, synthetic, semi-synthetic), by structure (linear, branched, cross-linked), and by the mode of polymerisation (addition/chain growth and condensation/step growth). Addition polymers form by successive addition of monomers with double bonds (e.g., polyethylene, PVC, polystyrene, teflon). Condensation polymers form by reaction between bifunctional monomers with elimination of small molecules like water (e.g., nylon-6,6, polyester/Dacron, bakelite). Copolymers contain two or more different monomers. Rubber can be natural (polyisoprene) or synthetic (Buna-S, Buna-N, neoprene); vulcanisation with sulphur improves its properties. Biodegradable polymers like PHBV and nylon-2-nylon-6 are environmentally friendly alternatives. Molecular mass is described by number average and weight average values.",
    "rules": [
      "Addition polymerisation involves unsaturated monomers joining without loss of atoms; condensation polymerisation involves bifunctional monomers joining with elimination of small molecules.",
      "Vulcanisation of rubber involves cross-linking polyisoprene chains with sulphur bridges, improving elasticity, strength, and resistance to solvents.",
      "Nylon-6,6 is formed by the condensation of hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid; Nylon-6 is formed by ring-opening polymerisation of caprolactam."
