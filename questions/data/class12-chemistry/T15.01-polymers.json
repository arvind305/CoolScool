    "text": "Polymers are large macromolecules formed by the repetitive bonding of smaller units called monomers. They are classified by source (natural, synthetic, semi-synthetic), by structure (linear, branched, cross-linked), and by the mode of polymerisation (addition/chain growth and condensation/step growth). Addition polymers form by successive addition of monomers with double bonds (e.g., polyethylene, PVC, polystyrene, teflon). Condensation polymers form by reaction between bifunctional monomers with elimination of small molecules like water (e.g., nylon-6,6, polyester/Dacron, bakelite). Copolymers contain two or more different monomers. Rubber can be natural (polyisoprene) or synthetic (Buna-S, Buna-N, neoprene); vulcanisation with sulphur improves its properties. Biodegradable polymers like PHBV and nylon-2-nylon-6 are environmentally friendly alternatives. Molecular mass is described by number average and weight average values.",
    "rules": [
      "Addition polymerisation involves unsaturated monomers joining without loss of atoms; condensation polymerisation involves bifunctional monomers joining with elimination of small molecules.",
      "Vulcanisation of rubber involves cross-linking polyisoprene chains with sulphur bridges, improving elasticity, strength, and resistance to solvents.",
      "Nylon-6,6 is formed by the condensation of hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid; Nylon-6 is formed by ring-opening polymerisation of caprolactam."

      "explanation_correct": "In addition polymerisation, monomers with C=C double bonds add directly to the growing chain without any loss of atoms, so no by-product is formed. In condensation polymerisation, bifunctional monomers react with each other and a small molecule (commonly water, HCl, or ammonia) is eliminated in each step.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A reverses the two processes. Option C is wrong because addition polymerisation does not eliminate any molecule. Option D is wrong because condensation polymerisation does produce a small molecule as a by-product. The key distinction is that addition polymerisation retains all atoms of the monomers, whereas condensation polymerisation always involves elimination."

The real point is that among the options, all three diene-based polymers (A, B, C) are indeed elastomers, so none of them contradicts the generalisation. Students should recognise that Bakelite is not diene-based. However, at an advanced level, certain diene polymers can be rigid plastics if heavily cross-linked or if the diene structure is modified. Bakelite is the correct answer because it is the only non-diene polymer listed, and selecting it shows the student understands that not every polymer in a list is diene-based.",

These cross-links restrict chain mobility and give vulcanised rubber its improved elasticity and strength.",
