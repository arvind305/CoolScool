    "text": "Chemistry plays a vital role in everyday life through drugs, food chemicals, and cleansing agents. Drugs are classified by their therapeutic action: analgesics (pain relievers), tranquilizers (sedatives), antiseptics, disinfectants, antimicrobials (antibiotics), antifertility drugs, antacids, and antihistamines. Drug-target interactions primarily involve enzymes (as competitive or non-competitive inhibitors) and receptors (agonists or antagonists). Chemicals in food include artificial sweeteners (aspartame, saccharin, sucralose), food preservatives (sodium benzoate, sorbic acid), and antioxidants (BHA, BHT). Soaps are sodium or potassium salts of long-chain fatty acids formed by saponification, and they clean by forming micelles around grease/oil. Synthetic detergents are classified as anionic, cationic, and non-ionic, and unlike soaps, they work in hard water.",
    "rules": [
      "Drugs interact with targets by binding to enzyme active sites (competitive inhibition) or allosteric sites (non-competitive inhibition), or by binding to receptors to trigger/block biological responses.",
      "Soaps form micelles with the hydrophobic tail dissolving grease and the hydrophilic head pointing outward into water; they do not work well in hard water due to formation of insoluble calcium/magnesium salts.",
      "Synthetic detergents are sulphonate or sulphate salts (anionic), quaternary ammonium salts (cationic), or polyethylene glycol ethers (non-ionic), and they work in both soft and hard water."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Analgesics are not drugs that reduce fever (that would be antipyretics), kill bacteria (that would be antibiotics), or reduce anxiety (that would be tranquilizers or sedatives). Analgesics specifically target and relieve pain, which is why option B is the correct answer."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'saponification'. Saponification is the chemical process where fats or oils are reacted with a strong base, such as sodium hydroxide (NaOH), to produce glycerol and the sodium salts of fatty acids, which are the main components of soap.

Antihistamines are drugs that work by blocking the action of histamine, a chemical in the body that causes allergy symptoms.
