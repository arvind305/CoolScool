    "text": "Electrostatics deals with the study of forces, fields, and potentials arising from static electric charges. Coulomb's law quantifies the force between two point charges as F = kq1q2/r^2, and the electric field E = F/q0 describes the force per unit positive test charge. Gauss's law relates the total electric flux through a closed surface to the enclosed charge (phi = q_enclosed/epsilon_0), providing a powerful tool for symmetric charge distributions. Electric potential V = kq/r is the work done per unit charge in bringing a test charge from infinity, and the relation E = -dV/dr connects field and potential. Capacitors store energy (U = 1/2 CV^2) with capacitance depending on geometry and dielectric medium. Electric dipoles, characterised by dipole moment p = q.2a, experience torque tau = p x E in uniform fields.",

      "explanation_correct": "The energy density in an electric field E is given by u = 1/2 epsilon_0 E^2 because this expression represents the energy per unit volume stored in the electric field. The electric field stores energy in the form of electric potential energy, and this energy density formula is derived from the principles of electrostatics.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer format is 1/2 epsilon_0 E^2, where epsilon_0 is the permittivity of free space. This expression for the energy density accounts for the energy stored per unit volume in the electric field. Incorrect answers may include just E^2, or may miss the 1/2 factor, but the complete expression is required to correctly describe the energy density in the electric field."

      "correct_answer": "2",
      "explanation_correct": "The ratio of the electric field on the axial line to the equatorial line of an electric dipole at the same large distance is 2. This is because the electric field of a dipole follows a cos(theta) distribution, where theta is the angle between the dipole axis and the observation point. At large distances, the cosine of the angle on the axial line (theta = 0) is 1, while the cosine on the equatorial line (theta = 90 degrees) is 0, leading to a ratio of 2.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is a single number, in this case '2'. An incorrect explanation could be that the electric field on the axial line is the same as the electric field on the equatorial line, because the dipole field is uniform in all directions. This is not correct, as the dipole field follows a directional dependence, with the field being stronger along the dipole axis compared to the equatorial plane."

      "correct_answer": "one-fourth",
      "explanation_correct": "According to Coulomb's law, the force between two charges is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. If the distance is doubled, the force becomes one-fourth of the original force, since the distance term in the denominator is squared.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be that the force becomes half the original force when the distance is doubled. This is not correct because Coulomb's law states that the force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance. Therefore, if the distance is doubled, the force becomes one-fourth (1/4) of the original force."

      "explanation_correct": "The formula for the capacitance of a parallel plate capacitor is C = epsilon_0 A/d, where epsilon_0 is the permittivity of free space, A is the area of the plates, and d is the separation between the plates. This formula is derived from the definition of capacitance as the ratio of the stored charge to the applied voltage, and the fact that the electric field between the plates is uniform and proportional to the charge density and inversely proportional to the plate separation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be something like C = q/V, which is the general formula for capacitance but does not take into account the specific geometry of a parallel plate capacitor. The correct formula C = epsilon_0 A/d is derived by considering the uniform electric field between the plates and the proportionality between the stored charge and the applied voltage."
