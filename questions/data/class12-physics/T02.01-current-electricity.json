    "text": "Current electricity studies the flow of electric charge through conductors. Electric current I is the rate of flow of charge and is related to drift velocity by I = nAv_d e. Ohm's law states V = IR, where resistance R = rho l/A depends on the material's resistivity, length, and cross-sectional area. Kirchhoff's junction rule conserves charge, and the loop rule conserves energy in circuit analysis. The Wheatstone bridge provides a null method for measuring resistance (P/Q = R/S), while the potentiometer compares EMFs without drawing current. Electrical power P = VI = I^2R = V^2/R governs energy dissipation in circuits.",

      "explanation_correct": "The order of increasing resistivity is silver (C), copper (A), nichrome (B), and germanium (D). This is because silver and copper are good conductors with low resistivity, while nichrome is a poorer conductor and germanium is a semiconductor with relatively high resistivity.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be copper (A), silver (C), nichrome (B), and germanium (D). This is incorrect because silver is a better conductor than copper, with lower resistivity. Nichrome has higher resistivity than both copper and silver, while germanium has the highest resistivity as a semiconductor material."

      "explanation_correct": "The power dissipation in a resistor is given by P = V^2/R. Since the voltage is fixed at 12V, the resistor with the highest resistance (C, 12Ω) will have the lowest power dissipation, followed by B (6Ω), D (3Ω), and A (2Ω) in increasing order of power dissipation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to arrange the resistors in increasing order of resistance, which is A (2Ω), D (3Ω), B (6Ω), C (12Ω). However, this is not the correct order of increasing power dissipation, as power dissipation depends on both the voltage and the resistance, not just the resistance alone."
