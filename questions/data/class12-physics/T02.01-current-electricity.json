    "text": "Current electricity studies the flow of electric charge through conductors. Electric current I is the rate of flow of charge and is related to drift velocity by I = nAv_d e. Ohm's law states V = IR, where resistance R = rho l/A depends on the material's resistivity, length, and cross-sectional area. Kirchhoff's junction rule conserves charge, and the loop rule conserves energy in circuit analysis. The Wheatstone bridge provides a null method for measuring resistance (P/Q = R/S), while the potentiometer compares EMFs without drawing current. Electrical power P = VI = I^2R = V^2/R governs energy dissipation in circuits.",

Wait, let me recalculate: 0.1 kW × 24 × 30 = 72 kWh; 1.5 kW × 8 × 30 = 360 kWh. Total = 432 kWh × Rs 6 = Rs 2592.
