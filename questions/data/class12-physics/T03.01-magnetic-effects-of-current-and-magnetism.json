    "text": "Moving charges and currents produce magnetic fields. The Biot-Savart law gives the magnetic field due to a small current element: dB = (mu_0/4pi)(Idl x r/r^3). Ampere's circuital law provides a simpler method for symmetric current distributions, yielding B = mu_0 nI inside a solenoid. A moving charge in a magnetic field experiences the Lorentz force F = qv x B, causing circular or helical motion. Current-carrying conductors in a magnetic field experience force F = Il x B, and the force between parallel conductors defines the ampere. Magnetic materials are classified as diamagnetic, paramagnetic, or ferromagnetic based on their susceptibility and response to external fields.",

This is because an electric current produces a magnetic field, and the line integral of the field around a closed loop is directly proportional to the current enclosed.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The other options are incorrect because: B) The total magnetic flux through the loop is not equal to the line integral of B around the loop, which is what Ampere's law describes. C) Ampere's law has nothing to do with electric flux or the permittivity of free space (ε₀). D) The line integral of B around a closed loop is not always zero, as it is directly related to the current enclosed by the loop as per Ampere's law."

      "question_text": "The cyclotron frequency of a charged particle is f = ___.",
      "correct_answer": "qB/(2pi m)",
      "explanation_correct": "The cyclotron frequency of a charged particle is given by the formula f = qB/(2pi m), where q is the charge of the particle, B is the magnetic field, and m is the mass of the particle. This formula is derived from the Lorentz force equation, which describes the force experienced by a moving charged particle in a magnetic field.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be something like f = qB/m. This formula is missing the 2pi term, which is an essential part of the cyclotron frequency formula. The 2pi term arises from the fact that the charged particle follows a circular path in the magnetic field, and the cyclotron frequency represents the number of revolutions per second. The correct answer, f = qB/(2pi m), takes this circular motion into account and provides the accurate expression for the cyclotron frequency."

      "question_text": "The magnetic field at a point on the axis of a circular loop at large distance x from the centre is proportional to ___.",
      "correct_answer": "1/x^3",
      "explanation_correct": "The magnetic field at a point on the axis of a circular loop is proportional to 1/x^3, where x is the distance from the center of the loop. This is because the magnetic field from a small current element follows the Biot-Savart law, which shows that the field decreases with the cube of the distance from the current element.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be something like '1/x' or '1/x^2'. This is because the magnetic field from a circular loop does not decrease linearly with distance (1/x) or with the square of the distance (1/x^2), but rather with the cube of the distance (1/x^3) according to the Biot-Savart law."

      "correct_answer": "Curie",
      "explanation_correct": "The temperature above which a ferromagnetic substance becomes paramagnetic is called the Curie temperature. This is because at the Curie temperature, the magnetic moments of the atoms in the ferromagnetic material become randomized, causing the material to lose its strong magnetic properties and become paramagnetic instead.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'Curie' temperature. Ferromagnetic materials like iron, nickel, and cobalt exhibit strong magnetic properties at normal temperatures. However, when the temperature is raised above a certain critical value, the thermal energy becomes high enough to randomize the alignment of the magnetic moments of the atoms, causing the material to lose its ferromagnetism and become paramagnetic instead. This critical temperature is known as the Curie temperature."

This is incorrect because paramagnetic materials have a higher magnetic susceptibility than vacuum, which has no magnetic properties.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be A, B, D, C (proton, alpha particle, deuteron, electron). This is wrong because the radius of the circular path in a magnetic field depends on the charge-to-mass ratio of the particle, not just the mass or charge alone.
