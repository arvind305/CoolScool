    "text": "Electromagnetic induction describes the generation of EMF due to changing magnetic flux, governed by Faraday's law: EMF = -d(phi_B)/dt. Lenz's law determines the direction of induced current, opposing the change in flux. Self-inductance (L) and mutual inductance (M) quantify the ability of coils to induce EMF in themselves or neighbouring coils. An AC generator produces sinusoidal EMF E = E0 sin(omega t). In AC circuits, impedance Z combines resistance and reactance, with resonance occurring when X_L = X_C at frequency f_r = 1/(2pi sqrt(LC)). Transformers use electromagnetic induction to step up or step down AC voltages according to the turns ratio V_s/V_p = N_s/N_p.",

      "correct_answer": "I_p/I_s",
      "explanation_correct": "The turns ratio of a transformer is defined as the ratio of the number of turns in the secondary coil (N_s) to the number of turns in the primary coil (N_p), which is also equal to the ratio of the secondary voltage (V_s) to the primary voltage (V_p). This is because the secondary current (I_s) is inversely proportional to the primary current (I_p) in the transformer, so the turns ratio is also equal to the ratio of primary current to secondary current (I_p/I_s).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be the ratio of the secondary voltage to the primary voltage (V_s/V_p). While this is also a correct expression for the turns ratio, the question specifically asks for the relationship between the primary and secondary currents. The correct answer is the ratio of the primary current to the secondary current (I_p/I_s), which is equal to the turns ratio N_s/N_p."

      "question_text": "The average power in an AC circuit is P = V_rms I_rms cos(phi), where cos(phi) is called the ___.",
      "correct_answer": "power factor",
      "explanation_correct": "The power factor cos(phi) represents the ratio of the real power (W) to the apparent power (VA) in an AC circuit. It quantifies how much of the total power is actually being used to do work, as opposed to just being stored and returned to the source. This makes the power factor an important parameter in determining the efficiency of an AC circuit.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 'power factor'. The power factor is not the same as resistance or reactance in an AC circuit. Rather, it represents the phase difference between the voltage and current, and determines how much of the apparent power is actually being used for useful work. Misunderstanding the power factor and its role in AC circuits would lead to the wrong answer."

      "correct_answer": "opposes",
      "explanation_correct": "According to Lenz's law, the direction of the induced current is such that it opposes the change in magnetic flux producing it. This is because the induced current creates its own magnetic field that opposes the original change in magnetic flux, as per the law of electromagnetic induction.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'opposes'. Lenz's law states that the direction of the induced current is such that it opposes the change in magnetic flux that is producing it. This is because the induced current creates its own magnetic field that acts to counter the original change in flux, in accordance with the principle of electromagnetic induction."

This is wrong because the instantaneous value at t = 0 (D) is the highest, not the average value over the positive half cycle (A).
