    "text": "Electromagnetic waves are self-propagating oscillations of electric and magnetic fields, predicted by Maxwell's equations. The displacement current concept completed Ampere's law to show that a changing electric field produces a magnetic field, just as a changing magnetic field produces an electric field. EM waves are transverse, with E and B perpendicular to each other and to the direction of propagation, travelling at speed c = 1/sqrt(mu_0 epsilon_0) = 3 x 10^8 m/s in vacuum. The electromagnetic spectrum spans from radio waves (longest wavelength) to gamma rays (shortest wavelength), each region having distinct sources, detectors, and applications. The intensity of EM waves is given by I = (1/2) c epsilon_0 E0^2.",
