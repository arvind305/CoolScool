    "text": "Optics encompasses both ray optics (geometrical optics) and wave optics. Ray optics treats light as straight-line rays, using the mirror formula (1/v + 1/u = 1/f), thin lens formula (1/v - 1/u = 1/f), and lens maker's equation (1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2)). Optical instruments like microscopes and telescopes use combinations of lenses to achieve magnification. Wave optics treats light as waves, explaining interference (Young's double slit experiment: fringe width beta = lambda D/d), diffraction (single slit: minima at a sin theta = n lambda), and polarisation (Malus's law: I = I0 cos^2 theta). Brewster's law gives the polarising angle as tan(i_p) = n.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The combined focal length of two thin lenses placed in contact is not simply the average of the individual focal lengths. The formula 1/f_c = 1/f_1 + 1/f_2 must be used, where f_1 and f_2 are the focal lengths of the individual lenses.

      "explanation_correct": "The order of increasing refractive index in glass is: red (A), green (C), blue (D), violet (B). This is because the refractive index of a material is inversely proportional to the wavelength of light - shorter wavelengths (violet) have a higher refractive index compared to longer wavelengths (red).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to arrange the colours in the order A, C, B, D. This is incorrect because the refractive index increases as the wavelength of light decreases. Violet (B) has a higher refractive index than blue (D) since it has a shorter wavelength. The correct order from lowest to highest refractive index is red (A), green (C), blue (D), violet (B)."

This is wrong because the central bright fringe corresponds to the smallest path difference of 0, while the first bright fringe has a larger path difference of λ.

When it then passes through a second polaroid at 30° to the first, the intensity is further reduced by cos^2(30°) = 0.75 (C).

The correct order accounts for the specific angles between the polaroids and the resulting intensity reduction."
