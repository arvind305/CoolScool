    "text": "Optics encompasses both ray optics (geometrical optics) and wave optics. Ray optics treats light as straight-line rays, using the mirror formula (1/v + 1/u = 1/f), thin lens formula (1/v - 1/u = 1/f), and lens maker's equation (1/f = (n-1)(1/R1 - 1/R2)). Optical instruments like microscopes and telescopes use combinations of lenses to achieve magnification. Wave optics treats light as waves, explaining interference (Young's double slit experiment: fringe width beta = lambda D/d), diffraction (single slit: minima at a sin theta = n lambda), and polarisation (Malus's law: I = I0 cos^2 theta). Brewster's law gives the polarising angle as tan(i_p) = n.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The combined focal length of two thin lenses placed in contact is not simply the average of the individual focal lengths. The formula 1/f_c = 1/f_1 + 1/f_2 must be used, where f_1 and f_2 are the focal lengths of the individual lenses.
