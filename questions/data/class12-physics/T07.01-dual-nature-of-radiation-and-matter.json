    "text": "The dual nature of radiation and matter reveals that light exhibits both wave and particle properties. The photoelectric effect, explained by Einstein, shows that light consists of photons with energy E = hf, and electrons are ejected only when the photon energy exceeds the work function phi: KE_max = hf - phi. The stopping potential V0 satisfies eV0 = hf - phi. De Broglie proposed that matter also has wave-like properties, with wavelength lambda = h/(mv). The Davisson-Germer experiment confirmed electron diffraction. Graphical analysis of photoelectric data reveals the linear relationship between stopping potential and frequency, with the slope equal to h/e.",

This relationship is derived from the equation eV0 = hf - phi, where phi is the work function of the material. The slope of this linear graph is equal to h/e, as shown by the proportionality between the stopping potential and the frequency of the incident light.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to say that the slope of the graph is equal to h. While the energy of the photoelectrons is related to Planck's constant h through the equation E = hf, the slope of the V0 vs f graph is specifically equal to h/e, where e is the charge of an electron. This is because the stopping potential V0 is related to the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons, which is proportional to h/e and not just h alone."

      "correct_answer": "phi/h",
      "explanation_correct": "The threshold frequency f0 is related to the work function phi by f0 = phi/h because the work function represents the minimum energy required to eject an electron from a material, and this energy is directly proportional to the threshold frequency according to the photoelectric effect equation E = hf.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to state that the threshold frequency f0 is equal to the work function phi. This is incorrect because the photoelectric effect equation shows that the threshold frequency f0 is related to the work function phi by the formula f0 = phi/h, where h is Planck's constant. The threshold frequency is the minimum frequency of light required to eject electrons from the material, and this frequency is inversely proportional to the work function."

      "explanation_correct": "The Davisson-Germer experiment showed that electrons exhibit a diffraction pattern when fired at a crystalline surface, confirming de Broglie's hypothesis that matter has wave-like properties, just like light. This electron diffraction pattern provided experimental evidence for the wave nature of matter.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'diffraction'. The Davisson-Germer experiment demonstrated that electrons, which are a form of matter, exhibit a diffraction pattern when fired at a crystalline surface. This confirms de Broglie's hypothesis that matter has a wave-like nature, similar to how light exhibits both wave and particle properties. The observation of the diffraction pattern is the key evidence that supports the dual nature of matter."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 'sqrt(2mKE)'. However, the correct formula is lambda = h/sqrt(2mKE), not just 2mKE. This is because the momentum of the particle is related to its kinetic energy as p = sqrt(2mKE), so the de Broglie wavelength is inversely proportional to the square root of the kinetic energy, not just the kinetic energy itself."
