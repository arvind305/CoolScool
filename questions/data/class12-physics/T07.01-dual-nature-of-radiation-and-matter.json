    "text": "The dual nature of radiation and matter reveals that light exhibits both wave and particle properties. The photoelectric effect, explained by Einstein, shows that light consists of photons with energy E = hf, and electrons are ejected only when the photon energy exceeds the work function phi: KE_max = hf - phi. The stopping potential V0 satisfies eV0 = hf - phi. De Broglie proposed that matter also has wave-like properties, with wavelength lambda = h/(mv). The Davisson-Germer experiment confirmed electron diffraction. Graphical analysis of photoelectric data reveals the linear relationship between stopping potential and frequency, with the slope equal to h/e.",

The slope of this linear graph is equal to h/e, as shown by the proportionality between the stopping potential and the frequency of the incident light.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to say that the slope of the graph is equal to h. While the energy of the photoelectrons is related to Planck's constant h through the equation E = hf, the slope of the V0 vs f graph is specifically equal to h/e, where e is the charge of an electron. This is because the stopping potential V0 is related to the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons, which is proportional to h/e and not just h alone."
