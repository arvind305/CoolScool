    "text": "Bohr's model describes the hydrogen atom with quantised energy levels E_n = -13.6/n^2 eV and orbital radii r_n = 0.529 n^2 angstrom. Spectral series arise from transitions between levels: Lyman (to n=1), Balmer (to n=2), Paschen (to n=3). Nuclear structure involves protons and neutrons held together by the strong nuclear force, with nuclear size R = R0 A^(1/3). Radioactive decay follows N = N0 e^(-lambda t) with half-life T_1/2 = 0.693/lambda. The mass defect leads to binding energy via E = mc^2, and the binding energy per nucleon curve explains nuclear stability and the energy released in fission and fusion.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Option B, T_1/2 = 0.693 / λ, is the correct answer. This is because the half-life (T_1/2) is related to the decay constant (λ) by the formula T_1/2 = 0.693 / λ. This is derived from the exponential decay law, N = N_0 e^(-λt), where N is the number of radioactive nuclei remaining, N_0 is the initial number, and t is the time.

This is because when 1 u (unified atomic mass unit) of mass is converted to energy, the energy released is equal to the mass converted multiplied by the speed of light squared, as per Einstein's famous equation E = mc^2. Since 1 u = 1.66 x 10^-27 kg, and the speed of light is 3 x 10^8 m/s, the energy released is 931.5 MeV.",
