    "text": "Electronic devices are based on semiconductor physics. Energy band theory classifies solids into conductors, semiconductors, and insulators based on the energy gap between valence and conduction bands. Intrinsic semiconductors (Si, Ge) have equal electron and hole concentrations, while extrinsic semiconductors are doped to create n-type (excess electrons) or p-type (excess holes). The p-n junction forms a depletion layer and exhibits rectifying behaviour. Applications include half-wave and full-wave rectifiers, Zener diode voltage regulators, LEDs, and photodiodes. Logic gates (OR, AND, NOT, NAND, NOR) form the basis of digital electronics, with NAND and NOR being universal gates.",

      "explanation_correct": "If both inputs of a NOR gate are connected together, it functions as a NOT gate. This is because the NOR operation is 'true' only when both inputs are 'false'. With both inputs connected, the gate always sees 'true' inputs, so the output is always 'false', which is the opposite (NOT) of the input.",

In those cases, the output would depend on the specific logic operation defined for the gate. However, when both inputs are connected to the same signal, the NOR gate effectively becomes a NOT gate, inverting the input signal."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Many students think a p-n junction diode allows current flow in both directions, but this is not the case. A p-n junction diode has a built-in potential barrier that only allows current to flow easily in one direction, from the p-type to the n-type side.

      "explanation_incorrect": "A common misconception is that a half-wave rectifier is more efficient since it has a simpler circuit design.

      "explanation_incorrect": "To create a p-type semiconductor, you need to add a trivalent impurity (such as boron or gallium) to pure silicon.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The potential barrier across a silicon p-n junction at room temperature is not 0.5 V. The correct value is 0.7 V.

This constant voltage is called the Zener voltage, which is a key property of the Zener diode that allows it to be used as a voltage regulator.",

In a forward-biased p-n junction, the majority carriers (electrons in n-type and holes in p-type) are driven across the junction by the applied voltage, which reduces the width of the depletion region.

An AND gate can be constructed from NAND gates by feeding the output of one NAND gate into a second NAND gate with both its inputs tied together (acting as a NOT gate). So: first NAND gives NOT(A AND B), and the second NAND (used as NOT) inverts it back to (A AND B). Total: 2 NAND gates.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A (1 gate) is wrong because a single NAND gate gives the complement of the required AND function. Option C (3 gates) and Option D (4 gates) use more than necessary. The minimum is 2: one NAND gate followed by another NAND gate wired as an inverter."

The series resistor absorbs the excess voltage. This is the fundamental principle of Zener voltage regulation.",

Option C is irrelevant; thermal conductivity differences are not the primary reason for silicon's dominance.
