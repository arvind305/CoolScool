    "text": "A communication system consists of a transmitter, a channel, and a receiver. The message signal (information) must be modulated onto a high-frequency carrier wave for efficient transmission. Amplitude modulation (AM) varies the carrier amplitude proportional to the message signal, with modulation index m = A_m/A_c and bandwidth = 2f_m. Electromagnetic waves propagate via ground wave (low frequency, follows Earth's curvature), sky wave (reflected by ionosphere, HF), and space wave (line of sight, VHF/UHF). The line of sight distance is d = sqrt(2Rh) where R is the Earth's radius and h is the antenna height. Bandwidth requirements differ for speech (~4 kHz), music (~20 kHz), and video (~4.2 MHz).",

      "explanation_correct": "Sky wave propagation involves the reflection of radio waves from the ionosphere, a layer of the upper atmosphere that contains ionized gases. This allows radio signals to travel long distances beyond the line of sight, as the ionosphere can reflect the waves back to the Earth's surface.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Sky wave propagation does not involve reflection from the troposphere, stratosphere, or mesosphere. The troposphere is the lowest layer of the atmosphere, the stratosphere is the layer above that, and the mesosphere is the layer above the stratosphere. The ionosphere, which is the layer of the upper atmosphere containing ionized gases, is responsible for the reflection of radio waves in sky wave propagation."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The space wave propagation method is used for frequencies above 40 MHz, not 2 MHz or 30 MHz.

Option C) 10 kHz is incorrect because the audio bandwidth of a single station is 5 kHz, and the total bandwidth required for 10 stations would be much higher. Option D) 500 kHz is incorrect because the total bandwidth required is only 100 kHz, as explained in the correct explanation."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is ground wave, sky wave, and space wave, in increasing order of frequency range. Ground waves travel at lower frequencies and follow the curvature of the Earth, while sky waves use higher frequencies and are reflected by the ionosphere, and space waves use the highest frequencies and travel in a line-of-sight path.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be ground wave, space wave, and sky wave. This is incorrect because space waves use higher frequencies than sky waves, which are reflected by the ionosphere. Ground waves travel at the lowest frequencies and follow the Earth's curvature, while sky waves and space waves use higher frequencies for different propagation modes."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be A, D, C, B. Speech/telephone signals actually have a lower bandwidth requirement than Morse code/telegraph signals, as speech only requires around 4 kHz of bandwidth compared to the very narrow bandwidth of Morse code. Music signals require more bandwidth than speech, around 20 kHz, while TV video signals have the highest bandwidth requirement of around 4.2 MHz."

This is incorrect because the message signal must be generated first (by the microphone) before it can be modulated onto the carrier wave.
