    "text": "A communication system consists of a transmitter, a channel, and a receiver. The message signal (information) must be modulated onto a high-frequency carrier wave for efficient transmission. Amplitude modulation (AM) varies the carrier amplitude proportional to the message signal, with modulation index m = A_m/A_c and bandwidth = 2f_m. Electromagnetic waves propagate via ground wave (low frequency, follows Earth's curvature), sky wave (reflected by ionosphere, HF), and space wave (line of sight, VHF/UHF). The line of sight distance is d = sqrt(2Rh) where R is the Earth's radius and h is the antenna height. Bandwidth requirements differ for speech (~4 kHz), music (~20 kHz), and video (~4.2 MHz).",

      "explanation_correct": "Sky wave propagation involves the reflection of radio waves from the ionosphere, a layer of the upper atmosphere that contains ionized gases. This allows radio signals to travel long distances beyond the line of sight, as the ionosphere can reflect the waves back to the Earth's surface.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Sky wave propagation does not involve reflection from the troposphere, stratosphere, or mesosphere. The troposphere is the lowest layer of the atmosphere, the stratosphere is the layer above that, and the mesosphere is the layer above the stratosphere. The ionosphere, which is the layer of the upper atmosphere containing ionized gases, is responsible for the reflection of radio waves in sky wave propagation."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The space wave propagation method is used for frequencies above 40 MHz, not 2 MHz or 30 MHz.

Option C) 10 kHz is incorrect because the audio bandwidth of a single station is 5 kHz, and the total bandwidth required for 10 stations would be much higher. Option D) 500 kHz is incorrect because the total bandwidth required is only 100 kHz, as explained in the correct explanation."

The actual reasons for modulation are: (1) practical antenna size (antenna length ~ λ/4; low-frequency signals would need impractically long antennas), (2) avoiding signal mixing by assigning different carrier frequencies, and (3) increasing effective range since high-frequency signals radiate more efficiently.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Options A, B, and C are all valid reasons for modulation.

When m > 1, the factor (1 + m cos ω_m t) becomes negative during part of the cycle, which means the envelope crosses zero and reverses phase. The physical transmitter cannot produce negative amplitudes, so the waveform is clipped. This clipping distorts the envelope, adding harmonics and spurious frequencies that corrupt the recovered message signal.",
