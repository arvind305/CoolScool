    "text": "Relations and Functions in Class 12 extend the foundational concepts by exploring the classification of relations (reflexive, symmetric, transitive, and equivalence), the composition of functions, and the existence and computation of inverse functions. A relation R on a set A is reflexive if (a, a) belongs to R for every a in A, symmetric if (a, b) in R implies (b, a) in R, and transitive if (a, b) and (b, c) in R implies (a, c) in R. An equivalence relation satisfies all three properties and partitions the set into equivalence classes. The composition of functions (f o g)(x) = f(g(x)) combines two functions into one and is associative but generally not commutative. The inverse of a function f exists if and only if f is bijective (both one-one and onto), and is found by solving y = f(x) for x in terms of y, with verification through f o f⁻¹ = f⁻¹ o f = identity.",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct answer is -6 because (g o f)(3) = g(f(3)) = g(3^2) = g(9) = 9 + 1 = 10, and (f o g)(3) = f(g(3)) = f(3 + 1) = f(4) = 4^2 = 16. Therefore, (g o f)(3) - (f o g)(3) = 10 - 16 = -6.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to simply calculate (g o f)(3) and (f o g)(3) without considering the subtraction between them. This would result in the incorrect answer of 10 - 16 = -6, which is the accepted answer format but not the correct reasoning."

      "explanation_correct": "The relation 'congruence modulo 4' on the set of integers (ℤ) is an equivalence relation, which means it satisfies the properties of reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. This equivalence relation partitions the set of integers into 4 distinct equivalence classes: [0], [1], [2], and [3].",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is a single integer value. The incorrect response may have been a different number, such as 2 or 8. However, the relation 'congruence modulo 4' has 4 distinct equivalence classes because any integer can be expressed as being congruent to one of the numbers 0, 1, 2, or 3 modulo 4. Therefore, the correct number of equivalence classes is 4."

First, you need to check that every element a in A is related to itself, which is the reflexive property. Next, you check the symmetric property - that if a is related to b, then b is also related to a. Finally, you check the transitive property - that if a is related to b and b is related to c, then a is also related to c. If all three properties hold, then the relation is an equivalence relation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to first check the transitive property, then the symmetric property, and finally the reflexive property. This is not the right order because you need to establish the fundamental properties of reflexivity and symmetry before you can verify the more complex transitive property. The correct order is to start with reflexivity, then check symmetry, and finally verify transitivity, before concluding that the relation is an equivalence relation."
