    "text": "Matrices and Determinants at the Class 12 level encompass the classification of matrices (row, column, square, diagonal, scalar, identity, null, symmetric, skew-symmetric), matrix algebra (addition, scalar multiplication, multiplication with conformability rules), the transpose and its properties, determinants of 2×2 and 3×3 matrices using cofactor expansion, properties of determinants (row and column operations, effect of scalar multiplication, factor theorem), and the computation of the adjoint and inverse of a matrix. The inverse A⁻¹ = adj(A)/|A| exists only when |A| ≠ 0. Systems of linear equations in 2 or 3 variables are solved using the matrix method (AX = B gives X = A⁻¹B) and Cramer's rule.",
    "rules": [
      "Matrix multiplication is defined only when the number of columns of the first matrix equals the number of rows of the second matrix, and is associative but not commutative in general.",
      "For a square matrix A, the inverse A⁻¹ = adj(A)/|A| exists if and only if |A| ≠ 0 (the matrix is non-singular).",
      "Every square matrix can be uniquely expressed as the sum of a symmetric matrix ½(A + Aᵀ) and a skew-symmetric matrix ½(A − Aᵀ)."

This is because Cramer's rule involves finding the determinants of the coefficient matrix and the matrix formed by replacing the coefficients of x with the constants on the right-hand side.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The value of x is not given by x = Dₓ/D where Dₓ = |[[e, b], [f, d]]| and D = |[[a, b], [c, d]]|. This is because the correct formula for Dₓ is the determinant of the matrix formed by replacing the coefficients of x with the constants on the right-hand side, which is |[[e, b], [f, d]]|.

      "explanation_correct": "The given matrix A is a diagonal matrix with elements 2 and 3 on the diagonal. To find A³, we can simply cube each diagonal element, so the result is [[2³, 0], [0, 3³]], which simplifies to [[8, 0], [0, 27]].",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to think that A³ = A, since a diagonal matrix raised to a power simply means cubing each diagonal element. However, this is not the case here. The correct answer is [[8, 0], [0, 27]], which is obtained by cubing the diagonal elements 2 and 3 separately."

To do that, you need to compute the adjoint of A and divide it by the determinant |A|, but you can only do that after verifying that |A| is non-zero.
