    "text": "Continuity and Differentiability form the backbone of calculus at the Class 12 level. A function f is continuous at x = a if lim(x→a) f(x) = f(a), meaning the left-hand limit, right-hand limit, and function value all agree. Differentiability at a point implies continuity, but the converse is not necessarily true (e.g., f(x) = |x| is continuous at x = 0 but not differentiable). Key differentiation techniques include the chain rule for composite functions dy/dx = (dy/du)(du/dx), implicit differentiation for equations involving both x and y, parametric differentiation where dy/dx = (dy/dt)/(dx/dt), and logarithmic differentiation for functions of the form y = [f(x)]^g(x). Derivatives of inverse trigonometric functions (sin⁻¹x, cos⁻¹x, tan⁻¹x), exponential and logarithmic functions are essential. Second-order derivatives d²y/dx² are computed by differentiating dy/dx. Rolle's theorem and the Mean Value Theorem provide theoretical foundations connecting function values with derivatives.",

In this case, f(x) = x^2 - 6x + 8 is continuous on [2, 4] and differentiable on (2, 4), and f(2) = f(4) = 0, so the point c where the derivative is 0 is c = 3.",
