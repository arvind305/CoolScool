    "text": "Applications of Derivatives use the concepts of differentiation to solve practical problems. The derivative dy/dx represents the rate of change of y with respect to x. Related rates problems apply the chain rule to find how one quantity changes with respect to time when another related quantity is changing. A function f is increasing on an interval where f'(x) > 0 and decreasing where f'(x) < 0. Critical points occur where f'(x) = 0 or f'(x) is undefined. The first derivative test examines the sign change of f'(x) around a critical point to classify local maxima and minima. The second derivative test states: if f'(c) = 0 and f''(c) > 0, then c is a local minimum; if f''(c) < 0, then c is a local maximum. For absolute extrema on a closed interval, evaluate f at critical points and endpoints. Applied optimisation problems involve translating real-world constraints into mathematical functions and finding their extreme values. The slope of the tangent to y = f(x) at (x₁, y₁) is f'(x₁), and the normal has slope −1/f'(x₁).",

      "question_text": "The slope of the normal to y = x³ at x = 1 is ___.",
      "correct_answer": "−1/3",
      "explanation_correct": "The slope of the normal to the curve y = x³ at x = 1 is −1/f'(x), where f'(x) is the derivative of the function. Since the derivative of x³ is 3x², the derivative at x = 1 is 3(1)² = 3. Therefore, the slope of the normal is −1/3.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is −1/3. To find the slope of the normal, we need to find the slope of the tangent line first. The slope of the tangent line is given by the derivative of the function, f'(x). In this case, the function is y = x³, so the derivative is f'(x) = 3x². Evaluating the derivative at x = 1 gives f'(1) = 3. The slope of the normal is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the tangent, which is −1/3."

      "correct_answer": "√2",
      "explanation_correct": "The maximum value of the function f(x) = sin(x) + cos(x) is √2 because the sum of the squares of the coefficients of sin(x) and cos(x) is 1, which means the function has a maximum value of √(1^2 + 1^2) = √2.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to say the maximum value is 2. This is wrong because the function f(x) = sin(x) + cos(x) has a maximum value when sin(x) = 1 and cos(x) = 1, which gives a maximum value of 1 + 1 = 2. However, the correct maximum value is √2 since the sum of the squares of the coefficients is 1."

      "explanation_correct": "The function f(x) = x³ - 12x is increasing on the intervals (-∞, -2) and (2, ∞) because its derivative f'(x) = 3x² - 12 is positive on these intervals, indicating the function is increasing.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is (-∞, -2) ∪ (2, ∞). This is because the derivative f'(x) = 3x² - 12 is positive for x < -2 and x > 2, indicating the function is increasing on those intervals. The function is decreasing on the interval [-2, 2] where the derivative is negative."

      "correct_answer": "1/π",
      "explanation_correct": "The correct answer is 1/π because the rate of change of the radius is equal to the rate of change of the area divided by the circumference of the circle. Since the area is increasing at 10 cm²/s and the radius is 5 cm, the circumference is 2πr = 10π cm. Therefore, the rate of change of the radius is 10 cm²/s divided by 10π cm, which equals 1/π cm/s.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to simply divide the rate of change of the area (10 cm²/s) by the radius (5 cm), which would give 2 cm/s. However, this is not correct because the rate of change of the radius is not directly proportional to the rate of change of the area. The correct formula involves dividing the rate of change of the area by the circumference of the circle, which is 2πr, to get the rate of change of the radius."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The steps should be in the order given in the correct answer. Finding the critical points by setting the first derivative equal to zero is the first step, followed by computing the second derivative.

Finally, you can use the second derivative test to confirm if the critical points are local maxima or minima, and compute the optimal value.",
