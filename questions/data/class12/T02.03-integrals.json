    "text": "Integrals form the second fundamental operation of calculus, serving as the inverse of differentiation. An indefinite integral (anti-derivative) ∫f(x)dx = F(x) + C where F'(x) = f(x). Standard integrals include ∫xⁿdx = xⁿ⁺¹/(n+1) + C (n ≠ −1), ∫sin(x)dx = −cos(x) + C, ∫cos(x)dx = sin(x) + C, ∫eˣdx = eˣ + C, and ∫(1/x)dx = ln|x| + C. The three main methods of integration are: substitution (changing variable to simplify), partial fractions (decomposing rational functions), and integration by parts (∫u dv = uv − ∫v du). Definite integrals are evaluated using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus: ∫ₐᵇ f(x)dx = F(b) − F(a). Key properties include: ∫ₐᵇ f(x)dx = −∫ᵇₐ f(x)dx, ∫₋ₐᵃ f(x)dx = 0 if f is odd and 2∫₀ᵃ f(x)dx if f is even, and ∫₀²ᵃ f(x)dx = 2∫₀ᵃ f(x)dx if f(2a−x) = f(x).",

      "correct_answer": "0",
      "explanation_correct": "The integral ∫₋₃³ x⁵ dx is equal to 0 because the function x⁵ is an odd function. For odd functions, the integral over a symmetric interval around 0 (like [-3, 3] here) is always 0.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to evaluate the integral directly using the power rule for integration: ∫x⁵dx = x⁶/6 + C. However, since the interval is [-3, 3], which is symmetric around 0, and the function x⁵ is an odd function, the integral evaluates to 0 due to the property of odd functions mentioned earlier."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be e^(2x), which is not correct because the integral of e^(2x) is not just e^(2x). The correct answer is e^(2x)/2 + C, where the 2 in the exponent becomes the denominator of the final expression after integration."

The next step is to compute du = dx and v = sin(x), also correct. Then, we apply the integration by parts formula: ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du, which gives us x·sin(x) - ∫sin(x) dx.
