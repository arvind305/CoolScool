    "text": "Applications of Integrals use definite integrals to compute areas of plane regions. The area under a curve y = f(x) from x = a to x = b (when f(x) ≥ 0) is given by ∫ₐᵇ f(x) dx. If the curve lies below the x-axis, the area is the absolute value of the integral. For area bounded by a curve and the y-axis, we integrate with respect to y: ∫_{c}^{d} x dy. The area between two curves y = f(x) and y = g(x), where f(x) ≥ g(x) on [a, b], is ∫ₐᵇ [f(x) − g(x)] dx. Standard applications include computing the area of a circle x² + y² = r² as πr² using integration, the area of an ellipse x²/a² + y²/b² = 1 as πab, and the area enclosed between a parabola and a line. When curves intersect, the points of intersection determine the limits of integration.",

      "explanation_correct": "The area bounded by y = cos(x), x = 0, x = π, and the x-axis is 2 units. This is because the cosine function is positive between 0 and π, and the definite integral of cos(x) from 0 to π is equal to 2.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The area bounded by y = cos(x), x = 0, x = π, and the x-axis is not 1. The correct answer is 2. This is because the area under the cosine curve from 0 to π is equal to 2 units, as the definite integral of cos(x) from 0 to π is 2."

This is important because the points of intersection define the limits of integration for each sub-interval where one curve is above the other. Without knowing the intersection points, you cannot properly set up the integral to calculate the area between the curves."
