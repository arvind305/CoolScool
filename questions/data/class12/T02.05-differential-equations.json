    "text": "A differential equation is an equation involving derivatives of an unknown function. The order of a differential equation is the highest order derivative present, and the degree is the power of the highest order derivative when the equation is polynomial in its derivatives. A differential equation can be formed by eliminating arbitrary constants from a given family of curves. The number of arbitrary constants determines the order. Methods of solving first-order ODEs include: (1) Variable separable method, where the equation can be written as f(x)dx = g(y)dy and solved by integrating both sides; (2) Homogeneous equations, where dy/dx = F(y/x), solved by substituting y = vx; (3) Linear first-order equations of the form dy/dx + P(x)y = Q(x), solved using the integrating factor e^(∫P(x)dx). The solution containing arbitrary constants is the general solution; a particular solution is obtained by using initial conditions.",
