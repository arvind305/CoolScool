    "text": "Vectors are quantities that have both magnitude and direction, represented as directed line segments. In 3D, a vector is expressed in component form as a = a₁i + a₂j + a₃k, where i, j, k are unit vectors along the x, y, z axes. The magnitude is |a| = √(a₁² + a₂² + a₃²). Direction cosines cos α, cos β, cos γ satisfy l² + m² + n² = 1. Vector addition follows the triangle and parallelogram laws. The scalar (dot) product a · b = a₁b₁ + a₂b₂ + a₃b₃ = |a||b|cos θ, giving the angle between vectors and projections (projection of a on b = a · b / |b|). The vector (cross) product a × b = |a||b|sin θ n̂, computed using the determinant form with i, j, k, gives a vector perpendicular to both a and b. The magnitude |a × b| equals the area of the parallelogram with sides a and b, and (1/2)|a × b| is the area of the triangle. The scalar triple product a · (b × c) gives the volume of the parallelepiped; three vectors are coplanar if and only if their scalar triple product is zero.",

      "correct_answer": "1/2",
      "explanation_correct": "The area of a triangle with sides a and b is given by (1/2) × |a × b|, where |a × b| is the magnitude of the vector cross product of a and b. This is because the vector cross product a × b gives a vector perpendicular to both a and b, and its magnitude |a × b| represents the area of the parallelogram formed by a and b. Since the triangle is half the parallelogram, the formula for the triangle area is (1/2) × |a × b|.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be simply |a × b|, which represents the area of the parallelogram formed by the vectors a and b. However, the area of the triangle with sides a and b is actually (1/2) × |a × b|, since the triangle is half the size of the parallelogram. The correct answer is 1/2, as the formula for the triangle area involves a scaling factor of 1/2 applied to the parallelogram area."

      "explanation_correct": "The magnitude of a vector a = 6i + 2j - 3k is calculated using the formula |a| = √(a₁² + a₂² + a₃²). Substituting the given values, we get |a| = √(6² + 2² + (-3)²) = √(36 + 4 + 9) = √49 = 7.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is a single number. However, if you calculated the magnitude of the vector a = 6i + 2j - 3k incorrectly, you may have gotten a different value. Remember that the magnitude is the square root of the sum of the squares of the vector components, so the correct magnitude is 7."

This step-by-step process follows the definition of the dot product and its relationship to the angle between two vectors.",
