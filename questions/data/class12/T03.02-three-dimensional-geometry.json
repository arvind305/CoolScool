    "text": "Three-Dimensional Geometry at the Class 12 level extends coordinate geometry into 3D space. A line in 3D is represented in vector form as r = a + λb (where a is a position vector of a point on the line and b is the direction vector) or in Cartesian form as (x − x₁)/l = (y − y₁)/m = (z − z₁)/n. Direction cosines l, m, n satisfy l² + m² + n² = 1. The angle between two lines is found using their direction ratios or vectors. A plane is represented in vector form as r · n = d or in Cartesian form as ax + by + cz = d, where (a, b, c) is the normal to the plane. The angle between two planes is the angle between their normals. The angle between a line and a plane uses sin θ = |b · n|/(|b||n|). The distance of a point (x₁, y₁, z₁) from a plane ax + by + cz + d = 0 is |ax₁ + by₁ + cz₁ + d|/√(a² + b² + c²). The shortest distance between two skew lines can be computed using the cross product of their direction vectors.",

      "correct_answer": "√3",
      "explanation_correct": "The distance of the point (1, 1, 1) from the plane x + y + z = 6 is √3 because the distance formula for a point from a plane is |ax₁ + by₁ + cz₁ + d|/√(a² + b² + c²), and in this case, a = 1, b = 1, c = 1, d = -6, and the point is (1, 1, 1), so the distance is |1 + 1 + 1 - 6|/√(1² + 1² + 1²) = √3.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to simply plug in the coordinates of the point (1, 1, 1) into the plane equation x + y + z = 6, which would give 1 + 1 + 1 = 6, and then conclude that the distance is 0. However, this is not the correct way to find the distance of a point from a plane. The correct formula must be used, which takes into account the normal vector of the plane and the coordinates of the point."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to think the y-coordinate of the point is 2. This is because the position vector (2i + j) has a y-component of 1, but the direction vector (i - j + k) has a y-component of -1. So the y-coordinate of the point on the line with λ = 0 is 1, not 2."

      "correct_answer": "1",
      "explanation_correct": "The distance between two parallel planes is simply the difference between their constant terms. Since the planes x + 2y - 2z = 1 and x + 2y - 2z = 4 differ by a constant of 3, the distance between them is 3 units.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to think that the distance between the planes is not 1 unit. This is because the planes are parallel, meaning they have the same normal vector (1, 2, -2), and the only difference between them is the constant term. So the distance between the planes is simply the difference between their constant terms, which is 4 - 1 = 3 units."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 90 degrees. The angle between two lines is determined by their direction ratios. The direction ratios (1, 0, 0) and (0, 1, 0) are perpendicular to each other, so the angle between the lines is 90 degrees. This is the accepted answer format for this fill-in-the-blank question."

      "correct_answer": "√(a² + b² + c²)",
      "explanation_correct": "The formula for the distance of a point from a plane is the absolute value of the perpendicular distance from the point to the plane, which is given by |ax₁ + by₁ + cz₁ + d| divided by the length of the normal vector to the plane, which is √(a² + b² + c²). This ensures that the distance is always positive, regardless of the position of the point relative to the plane.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect formula would be to just divide |ax₁ + by₁ + cz₁ + d| by a, b, or c alone. However, this would not account for the length of the normal vector to the plane, which is needed to get the true perpendicular distance. The correct formula is to divide by the square root of the sum of the squares of a, b, and c, which gives the length of the normal vector."
