    "text": "Linear Programming (LP) is a mathematical method for optimising a linear objective function Z = ax + by subject to a system of linear inequality constraints. The decision variables x and y typically satisfy non-negativity constraints (x ≥ 0, y ≥ 0). The feasible region is the set of all points (x, y) satisfying all constraints simultaneously, forming a convex polygon (or unbounded region). By the Corner Point Theorem, the optimal value (maximum or minimum) of the objective function, if it exists, occurs at one of the vertices (corner points) of the feasible region. The graphical method involves: (1) plotting each constraint as a line and shading the appropriate half-plane, (2) identifying the feasible region, (3) finding all corner points, and (4) evaluating Z at each corner point to determine the optimum. Common applications include manufacturing problems (maximise profit), diet problems (minimise cost), and transportation/allocation problems.",

      "explanation_correct": "The minimum value of the objective function Z = x + y is 0, which occurs at the corner point (0, 0). This is because the objective function is minimised when both x and y are as small as possible, which happens at the origin (0, 0).",

However, this is incorrect because the objective function Z = x + y is minimised when both x and y are as small as possible, which happens at the corner point (0, 0) where the value of Z is 0."

If the LPP has no feasible solution, it means there are no values for the variables (x, y) that satisfy all the given constraints simultaneously.
