    "text": "Probability at the Class 12 level extends to conditional probability, independent events, Bayes' theorem, and random variables. Conditional probability P(A|B) = P(A ∩ B)/P(B) gives the probability of event A given that B has occurred. The multiplication theorem states P(A ∩ B) = P(A)·P(B|A). Events A and B are independent if P(A ∩ B) = P(A)·P(B), which is distinct from mutually exclusive events. The total probability theorem gives P(B) = Σ P(B|Aᵢ)·P(Aᵢ) over a partition {A₁, A₂, ..., Aₙ}. Bayes' theorem reverses conditional probabilities: P(Aᵢ|B) = P(B|Aᵢ)·P(Aᵢ) / Σ P(B|Aⱼ)·P(Aⱼ). A discrete random variable X has a probability distribution where Σ P(X = xᵢ) = 1. The mean (expectation) is E(X) = Σ xᵢ·P(X = xᵢ) and the variance is Var(X) = E(X²) − [E(X)]². The binomial distribution models n independent Bernoulli trials: P(X = r) = ⁿCᵣ·pʳ·qⁿ⁻ʳ where q = 1 − p.",

      "explanation_correct": "The probability P(Aᵢ|B) is called the 'posterior' probability because it represents the updated probability of event Aᵢ occurring, given the new information that event B has occurred. This is in contrast to the 'prior' probability P(Aᵢ), which is the probability of Aᵢ occurring without any additional information.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The 'posterior' probability refers to the updated probability of event Aᵢ occurring, given the new information that event B has occurred. This is the correct term used in Bayes' theorem, which is a formula for calculating conditional probabilities. The other options like 'conditional', 'marginal', or 'independent' do not accurately describe the type of probability represented by P(Aᵢ|B) in Bayes' theorem."

      "correct_answer": "0.35",
      "explanation_correct": "The correct answer is 0.35 because the probability of A and B occurring together, P(A ∩ B), is given by the formula P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B|A). Since P(A) = 0.7 and P(B|A) = 0.5, we can calculate P(A ∩ B) = 0.7 * 0.5 = 0.35.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to simply multiply P(A) and P(B), which is 0.7 * 0.5 = 0.35. However, this is not the correct answer, as P(A ∩ B) requires the use of the conditional probability P(B|A) in the formula P(A ∩ B) = P(A) * P(B|A). The accepted answer format is a decimal number to 2 decimal places, so the correct answer is 0.35."

      "explanation_correct": "Since A and B are independent events, the probability of their union is simply the sum of their individual probabilities: P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B) = 0.6 + 0.5 - (0.6 × 0.5) = 0.8.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 0.8. For independent events A and B, the probability of their union is given by P(A ∪ B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A ∩ B). Since P(A) = 0.6 and P(B) = 0.5, and A and B are independent, P(A ∩ B) = P(A) × P(B) = 0.6 × 0.5 = 0.3. Plugging these values, we get P(A ∪ B) = 0.6 + 0.5 - 0.3 = 0.8."
