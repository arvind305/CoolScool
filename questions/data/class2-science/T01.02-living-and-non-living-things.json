    "text": "Everything around us can be divided into two groups: living things and non-living things. Living things like plants, animals, and humans need food and water, breathe air, grow and change, move on their own, and can have babies. Non-living things like stones, toys, and furniture do not eat, breathe, grow, move by themselves, or have babies. We can look at these characteristics to decide if something is living or non-living.",
