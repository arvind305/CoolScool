    "text": "Plants are living things that grow all around us. Every plant has six main parts: roots, stem, leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds. Each part has an important job. The root absorbs water from the soil and holds the plant firmly. The stem carries water to the leaves and supports the plant. Leaves make food for the plant using sunlight. Flowers help make seeds. Fruits contain seeds, and seeds grow into new plants. Plants are of different types: trees are tall with thick trunks, shrubs are medium-sized with many stems, herbs are small with soft stems, climbers grow upward with support, and creepers spread along the ground.",
