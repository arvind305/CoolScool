    "text": "Animals live all around us in different places called habitats. Some animals live on land like dogs, cats, and elephants. Some live in water like fish and whales. Some live both on land and in water like frogs and turtles. Animals eat different types of food. Herbivores like cows and rabbits eat only plants. Carnivores like lions and tigers eat only meat. Omnivores like bears and crows eat both plants and meat. Baby animals have special names - a baby dog is a puppy, a baby cat is a kitten. Animals have different body coverings like fur, feathers, scales, and shells to protect them.",
