    "text": "We get food from two main sources: plants and animals. Plants give us fruits, vegetables, grains, and pulses. Animals give us milk, eggs, meat, and honey. Food can be divided into different types: fruits like apples and bananas, vegetables like carrots and spinach, grains like rice and wheat, dairy products like milk and cheese, and pulses like dal. Eating different types of food every day keeps us healthy - this is called eating a balanced diet. Some foods we eat raw like fruits and salads, while other foods we cook before eating like rice and vegetables.",
