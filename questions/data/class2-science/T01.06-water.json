    "text": "Water is essential for all living things. We use water for drinking, cooking, bathing, cleaning, and watering plants. Water comes from different sources like rain, rivers, lakes, wells, and taps. The water cycle is nature's way of recycling water: the sun heats water in rivers and seas, the water turns into vapor and goes up to form clouds, and then the clouds bring rain. We must save water because clean water is precious. We can save water by turning off taps when not in use, fixing leaky taps, and not wasting water.",

This water vapor then forms clouds in the sky, and the clouds bring rain, which is part of the water cycle. So the sun's heating of the water is an important part of the water cycle."
