    "text": "Air is all around us even though we cannot see it. Air has no color or smell when it is clean. All living things need air to breathe and stay alive. Moving air is called wind. Air helps birds fly, dries our clothes, and moves sailboats. Weather tells us what the sky and air are like each day. Weather can be sunny, rainy, cloudy, or windy. We have three main seasons: summer when it is hot, rainy season (monsoon) when it rains a lot, and winter when it is cold. We wear different clothes in different seasons.",

But air is all around us and when we put a balloon in the air, the air goes inside the balloon and makes it big. The air fills up the empty space inside the balloon, which is why a balloon gets bigger when we fill it with air."
