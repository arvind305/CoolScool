    "text": "Earth is our home planet. It has both land and water. Land comes in different forms called landforms: mountains are very high, hills are smaller than mountains, plains are flat land, valleys are low areas between mountains, and deserts are dry sandy areas. Water on Earth is found in rivers that flow, lakes surrounded by land, and seas and oceans which are very large and salty. The Sun gives us light and heat during the day. When the Sun shines on our part of Earth, it is day. When the Sun does not shine on our part, it is night. The Moon shines at night.",
