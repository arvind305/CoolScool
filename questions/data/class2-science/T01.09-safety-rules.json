    "text": "Safety rules help us stay safe and avoid getting hurt. On the road, we should walk on footpaths, look both ways before crossing, use zebra crossings, and follow traffic lights (red means stop, yellow means wait, green means go). At home, we should not touch fire or hot things, play with sharp objects, or touch electrical sockets. At school and playground, we should not push others, run in corridors, or use equipment unsafely. We should never talk to strangers or take anything from them. If someone makes us uncomfortable, we should tell a trusted adult like a parent or teacher.",
