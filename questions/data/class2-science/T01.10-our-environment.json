    "text": "Our environment is everything around us - our home, school, neighborhood, plants, and animals. Keeping our surroundings clean is very important for our health. We should throw garbage in dustbins, not on the road or in water. Garbage is of two types: wet waste like food scraps and fruit peels, and dry waste like paper, plastic, and glass. We should care for plants by watering them and not plucking flowers unnecessarily. We should be kind to animals and not harm them. The three Rs - Reduce, Reuse, Recycle - help us take care of our environment. Reduce means using less, reuse means using things again, and recycle means making new things from old ones.",
