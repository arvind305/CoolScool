    "text": "A number line is a straight line with numbers placed at equal distances along it. Skip counting means jumping forward or backward by the same number each time. You can skip count by 2s, 3s, 4s, 5s, or 10s. Patterns appear when you skip count — for example, skip counting by 2s always gives even numbers. Finding missing numbers in a sequence means figuring out which number was skipped based on the counting pattern.",
    "rules": [
      "On a number line, numbers increase from left to right and decrease from right to left.",
      "Skip counting by 2s: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ... (add 2 each time).",
      "Skip counting by 5s: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ... (add 5 each time).",
      "Skip counting by 10s: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, ... (add 10 each time).",
      "Forward counting means adding the skip number; backward counting means subtracting it.",
      "To find a missing number in a pattern, first figure out how much is added or subtracted each time."
