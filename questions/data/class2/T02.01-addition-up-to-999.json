    "text": "Addition means finding the total when we put numbers together. We can add 2-digit and 3-digit numbers. When the digits in a column add up to 10 or more, we regroup (carry) to the next column. We can write addition in column form (one number below the other) or horizontal form (side by side). Adding zero to any number gives the same number (identity property). We can add two numbers in any order and get the same sum (commutative property). For example, 25 + 30 = 30 + 25 = 55.",
    "rules": [
      "Add ones first, then tens, then hundreds.",
      "When digits in a column add up to 10 or more, write the ones digit and carry the tens digit to the next column (regrouping).",
      "Column addition: write numbers one below the other, lining up ones, tens, and hundreds.",
      "Horizontal addition: write numbers side by side with a plus sign.",
      "Identity property: adding zero to any number gives the same number (a + 0 = a).",
      "Commutative property: the order of addends does not change the sum (a + b = b + a).",
      "All sums in this topic are up to 999. 3-digit addition is without regrouping only."
