  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Subtraction means taking away one number from another to find the difference. We can subtract 2-digit and 3-digit numbers using column subtraction (writing numbers one below the other) or horizontal subtraction. When the digit being subtracted is larger than the digit above it, we use regrouping (borrowing) from the next place. For example, in 53 − 27, since 3 < 7 we borrow 1 ten from the 5 tens, making it 13 − 7 = 6 ones and 4 − 2 = 2 tens, giving 26. We can always check our subtraction answer by adding the answer to the smaller number: if 86 − 34 = 52, then 52 + 34 should equal 86. Mental strategies like counting up, rounding, and using number bonds help us subtract quickly.",
    "rules": [
      "Subtraction finds the difference between two numbers.",
      "In column subtraction, line up ones under ones, tens under tens, and hundreds under hundreds.",
      "When a digit on top is smaller than the digit below, regroup (borrow) from the next higher place.",
      "Regrouping for 2-digit: borrow 1 ten (= 10 ones) from the tens place.",
      "To check subtraction, add the difference to the number subtracted: if a − b = c, then c + b = a.",
      "Horizontal subtraction works the same as column subtraction but is written on one line.",
      "All values in this topic are from 0 to 999 with no negative results.",
      "3-digit subtraction in this topic does not require regrouping."

For example, 43 is wrong because it does not account for the need to borrow 1 ten to make the 7 ones into 17 ones before subtracting. 51 is wrong because it does not show the correct regrouping of 1 ten from the 8 tens.
