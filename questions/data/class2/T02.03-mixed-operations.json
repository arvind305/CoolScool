    "text": "Mixed operations means using both addition and subtraction together to solve problems. Sometimes a problem has more than one step. You may need to add first and then subtract, or subtract first and then add. To solve word problems, read carefully and decide whether to add or subtract. Clue words like 'in all', 'total', and 'altogether' usually mean addition. Clue words like 'left', 'remaining', and 'how many more' usually mean subtraction. Addition and subtraction are inverse (opposite) operations: if 25 + 30 = 55, then 55 - 30 = 25.",
    "rules": [
      "Some problems need both addition and subtraction to find the answer.",
      "Read word problems carefully to decide which operation to use.",
      "Clue words like 'total', 'altogether', 'in all', and 'combined' suggest addition.",
      "Clue words like 'left', 'remaining', 'gave away', and 'how many more' suggest subtraction.",
      "Addition and subtraction are inverse operations: if a + b = c, then c - b = a and c - a = b.",
      "In multi-step problems, solve one step at a time in order.",
