    "text": "Multiplication is a quick way of adding the same number again and again. Instead of writing 4 + 4 + 4, we can write 3 × 4 = 12, which means 3 groups of 4. We can show multiplication using equal groups or arrays (rows and columns). The multiplication tables of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 10 help us find answers quickly. An important rule is that we can swap the numbers and the answer stays the same: 3 × 4 = 4 × 3. This is called the commutative property. Skip counting (2, 4, 6, 8 … or 5, 10, 15, 20 …) is the same as multiplying.",
