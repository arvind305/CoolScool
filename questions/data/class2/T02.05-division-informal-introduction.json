  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Division means sharing things equally or making equal groups. When we share equally, we give the same number of things to each person or group. For example, if you have 10 sweets and share them equally among 2 friends, each friend gets 5 sweets. When we make equal groups, we put the same number of things in each group. For example, if you have 12 pencils and put 3 in each group, you get 4 groups. Division is the opposite of multiplication.",
    "rules": [
      "Equal sharing means giving the same number of things to each person or group.",
      "Equal grouping means making groups with the same number of things in each group.",
      "When we share equally, every person gets the same amount.",
      "When we make equal groups, every group has the same number of items.",
      "All numbers in this topic are within 50.",
      "All division results are exact with no remainders."
