    "text": "In India, we use Rupees (₹) and Paise (p) as money. 1 Rupee = 100 paise. Coins come in ₹1, ₹2, ₹5, and ₹10. Notes come in ₹10, ₹20, ₹50, ₹100, and ₹500. We can convert rupees to paise by multiplying by 100, and paise to rupees by dividing by 100. We can add and subtract money amounts up to ₹100. When we buy something and pay more than the price, the shopkeeper gives us back the extra money, which is called change.",
