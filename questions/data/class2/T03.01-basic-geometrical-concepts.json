    "text": "Lines can be straight or curved. A straight line goes in one direction without bending. A curved line bends or turns. Figures can be open or closed. A closed figure has no gaps and its boundary line comes back to where it started. An open figure has a gap. A simple closed curve is a closed curve that does not cross itself. We can draw straight lines using a ruler or freehand without a ruler. The boundary of a closed figure separates the inside from the outside.",
