    "text": "2D shapes (plane figures) are flat shapes that have length and width but no thickness. We already know circle, triangle, square, and rectangle. Now we learn new shapes: an oval (ellipse) is like a stretched circle, a pentagon has 5 sides and 5 corners, and a hexagon has 6 sides and 6 corners. Every shape has a certain number of sides and corners (vertices). Some shapes have symmetry — if you fold them along a line of symmetry, both halves match exactly. We can find these shapes all around us in everyday objects and use them to create beautiful patterns.",
    "rules": [
      "A circle is round with 0 sides and 0 corners.",
      "A triangle has 3 sides and 3 corners.",
      "A square has 4 equal sides and 4 corners.",
      "A rectangle has 4 sides and 4 corners, with opposite sides equal.",
      "An oval (ellipse) is a stretched circle with 0 sides and 0 corners.",
      "A pentagon has 5 sides and 5 corners.",
      "A hexagon has 6 sides and 6 corners.",
      "Corners of a shape are also called vertices (one vertex, many vertices).",
      "A line of symmetry divides a shape into two matching halves.",
      "A square has 4 lines of symmetry; a rectangle has 2; a circle has many.",
      "Shapes can be found in everyday objects — a door is a rectangle, a wheel is a circle.",
      "We can combine shapes to make patterns and designs."
