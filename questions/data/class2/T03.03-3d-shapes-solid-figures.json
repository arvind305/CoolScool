    "text": "3D shapes are solid figures that have length, width, and height. Unlike flat 2D shapes, you can hold them in your hand. The basic 3D shapes are sphere, cube, cuboid, cone, cylinder, and pyramid. Each 3D shape has faces (flat or curved surfaces), edges (lines where two faces meet), and vertices (corners). Shapes with curved surfaces can roll, while shapes with only flat faces slide. The flat faces of 3D shapes are 2D shapes — for example, a cube has square faces and a cylinder has circular faces.",
    "rules": [
      "A cube has 6 square faces, 12 edges, and 8 vertices.",
      "A cuboid has 6 rectangular faces, 12 edges, and 8 vertices.",
      "A cone has 2 faces (1 flat circular face and 1 curved face), 1 edge, and 1 vertex.",
      "A cylinder has 3 faces (2 flat circular faces and 1 curved face), 2 edges, and 0 vertices.",
      "A sphere has 1 curved face, 0 edges, and 0 vertices.",
      "A square pyramid has 5 faces (1 square base and 4 triangular faces), 8 edges, and 5 vertices.",
      "A triangular pyramid has 4 triangular faces, 6 edges, and 4 vertices.",
      "Shapes with curved surfaces (sphere, cylinder, cone) can roll.",
      "Shapes with only flat faces (cube, cuboid, pyramid) slide when pushed.",
      "The flat faces of a 3D shape are 2D shapes.",
      "Faces are the flat or curved surfaces of a 3D shape.",
      "Edges are the lines where two faces meet.",
      "Vertices are the corners or points of a 3D shape."
