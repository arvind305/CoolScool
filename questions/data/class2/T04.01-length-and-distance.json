    "text": "Length tells us how long something is. We can measure length using non-standard units like handspans, footsteps, or pencil lengths. Standard units of length are centimetre (cm) and metre (m). A ruler is used to measure and draw line segments in centimetres. 1 metre is equal to 100 centimetres. We can compare and estimate lengths of different objects. Word problems help us use length in real-life situations.",
