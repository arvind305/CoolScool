    "text": "Mass or weight tells us how heavy an object is. We measure weight using standard units: gram (g) and kilogram (kg). Light objects like a pencil or a coin are measured in grams. Heavy objects like a bag of rice or a watermelon are measured in kilograms. 1 kilogram is equal to 1000 grams. We use a weighing scale to find the weight of an object. We can compare objects to tell which is heavier and which is lighter. We can also estimate the weight of everyday objects.",
