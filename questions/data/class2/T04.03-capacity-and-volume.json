    "text": "Capacity is the amount of liquid a container can hold. We measure capacity in milliliters (ml) and liters (l). A small medicine cup holds a few milliliters. A big water bottle holds about 1 liter. 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters. We use measuring cups and jugs marked with ml or l to find out how much liquid a container holds. We can compare containers to see which holds more, less, or the same. We can also estimate how much a container might hold before measuring. A container can be full, half-full, or empty.",
