    "text": "There are 7 days in a week: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday. A year has 12 months: January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December. A calendar shows the date, day, month and year. Yesterday is the day before today, and tomorrow is the day after today. An analog clock has a short hand (hour hand) and a long hand (minute hand). When the long hand points to 12, it is the exact hour (o'clock). When the long hand points to 6, it is half past that hour. A digital clock shows time using numbers with a colon, for example 3:00 or 4:30. The 12-hour format uses AM (midnight to noon) and PM (noon to midnight) to tell whether it is morning/before noon or afternoon/evening/night.",
