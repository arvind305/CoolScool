    "text": "Data is information we collect by asking people questions (surveys) or by watching and counting things (observations). After collecting data, we write it down in a simple table with rows and columns. To count quickly, we use tally marks: one small standing line (|) for each item. Every fifth tally mark is drawn across the first four to make a bundle of 5. A frequency table has three columns: the item name, the tally marks, and the total count (frequency). Frequency tables help us organize data neatly so we can compare and understand it easily. Numbers in our data can go up to 50.",

      "Data is information collected through surveys (asking questions) or observations (watching and counting).",
