    "text": "Data is information we collect by asking people questions (surveys) or by watching and counting things (observations). After collecting data, we write it down in a simple table with rows and columns. To count quickly, we use tally marks: one small standing line (|) for each item. Every fifth tally mark is drawn across the first four to make a bundle of 5. A frequency table has three columns: the item name, the tally marks, and the total count (frequency). Frequency tables help us organize data neatly so we can compare and understand it easily. Numbers in our data can go up to 50.",

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation_correct": "30 belongs to 6 groups of 5 because 30 can be divided into 6 equal groups, each with 5 items. This is the correct answer because 30 is a multiple of 5 and can be neatly organized into 6 groups of 5.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The other options are incorrect because they do not accurately describe how 30 can be organized. Option B has 1 group of 5 with 4 extra, but 30 is not 4 more than a multiple of 5. Option C has 2 groups of 5 with 1 extra, but 30 is not 1 more than a multiple of 5. Option D has 5 groups of 5, but 30 is not a multiple of 5."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The number 9 does not belong to the groups of 6 groups of 5, 2 groups of 5 and 1 extra, or 5 groups of 5. These groups are for numbers that are multiples of 5, like 10, 15, or 25. But 9 is not a multiple of 5, so it belongs to the group of 1 group of 5 and 4 extra."
