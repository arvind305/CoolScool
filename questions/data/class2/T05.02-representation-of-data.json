    "text": "Data can be shown using pictographs and bar graphs. A pictograph uses pictures or symbols to represent numbers. In a one-to-one pictograph, each symbol stands for 1 item. In a scaled pictograph, each symbol can stand for 2 or 5 items. A bar graph uses bars of different lengths to show data. Bar graphs can be vertical (bars go up) or horizontal (bars go sideways). Every graph has axes and labels that tell us what the data is about.",
    "rules": [
      "In a one-to-one pictograph, each symbol stands for 1 item.",
      "In a scaled pictograph, the key tells how many items each symbol stands for (e.g., 1 symbol = 2 or 1 symbol = 5).",
      "To find the total in a scaled pictograph, multiply the number of symbols by the scale value.",
      "A bar graph uses bars to show data; taller or longer bars mean larger values.",
      "A vertical bar graph has bars going up from the bottom; a horizontal bar graph has bars going sideways.",
      "The axes of a graph are the two lines: one shows the categories and the other shows the numbers.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is C, green, because it has the smallest number of items at 3. Blue has 9 items, which is more than green, and yellow has 7 items, which is also more than green. So green is the color with the fewest items on the graph."
