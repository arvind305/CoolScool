    "text": "Data is information collected about things. We can show data using pictographs, bar graphs, and tables. A pictograph uses small pictures to show numbers. A bar graph uses bars of different heights to show numbers. A table uses rows and columns to organise data. We can read these to find out how many, which is most, which is least, and compare amounts. We can also draw simple conclusions like which item is most popular or least popular.",
    "rules": [
      "A pictograph uses pictures or symbols to represent data. Each picture stands for one or more items.",
      "A bar graph uses bars to show data. Taller bars mean larger numbers.",
      "A table arranges data in rows and columns so it is easy to read.",
      "To find the most, look for the largest number, tallest bar, or most pictures.",
      "To find the least, look for the smallest number, shortest bar, or fewest pictures.",
      "We can compare two groups by looking at their numbers and finding which is more or less.",
      "We can draw simple conclusions such as which item is the favourite or which has the fewest."
