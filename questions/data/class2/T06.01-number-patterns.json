    "text": "A number pattern is a sequence of numbers that follows a rule. In a repeating pattern, a group of numbers repeats over and over, like 3, 6, 3, 6, 3, 6. In a growing pattern, numbers increase by the same amount each time, like 4, 7, 10, 13 (add 3 each time). Skip counting means counting forward by skipping the same number each time. You can skip count by 2s (2, 4, 6, 8), by 3s (3, 6, 9, 12), by 4s (4, 8, 12, 16), by 5s (5, 10, 15, 20), or by 10s (10, 20, 30, 40). To find a missing number in a pattern, first figure out the rule (how much is added or subtracted each time), then use the rule to fill the gap. Even numbers end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. Odd numbers end in 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. Even and odd numbers form their own patterns.",
