    "text": "Patterns are arrangements that repeat following a rule. We can make patterns using shapes (circle, square, triangle, star, etc.) and colors (red, blue, green, yellow, etc.). Simple repeating patterns like AB repeat two items: circle, square, circle, square. More complex patterns include ABC (three items repeating), AABB (two of each repeating), and ABB (one then two). To extend a pattern, find the repeating group and continue it. You can also create your own original patterns by choosing a rule and following it. A symmetrical pattern looks the same on both sides of a middle line, like a mirror image.",
    "rules": [
      "A repeating pattern has a core group that repeats over and over.",
      "An ABC pattern repeats three different items: A, B, C, A, B, C.",
      "An AABB pattern repeats two of each: A, A, B, B, A, A, B, B.",
      "An ABB pattern repeats one then two: A, B, B, A, B, B.",
      "To extend a pattern, identify the repeating core and continue it.",
      "A symmetrical pattern has two halves that are mirror images of each other.",
      "You can create original patterns by choosing shapes or colors and making a rule."
