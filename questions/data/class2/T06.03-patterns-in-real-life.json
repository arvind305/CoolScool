    "text": "Patterns are all around us! A pattern is something that repeats in the same order. In nature, we see patterns on flowers, leaves, and shells. Buildings and floor tiles also have patterns. The clothes we wear often have stripes, checks, or dots — these are patterns too! Many cultures use beautiful patterns in rangoli, mehndi, and embroidery. We can also create our own art using patterns.",
    "rules": [
      "A pattern is something that repeats in the same order.",
      "Nature has many patterns — petals on flowers, veins on leaves, spirals on shells.",
      "Buildings, windows, floor tiles, and fences can show repeating patterns.",
      "Clothing and textiles have patterns like stripes, checks, polka dots, and floral prints.",
      "Cultural patterns include rangoli, mehndi, kolam, and embroidery designs.",
      "We can create art by repeating shapes, colours, or designs in a pattern.",
      "To find a pattern, look for the part that repeats."
