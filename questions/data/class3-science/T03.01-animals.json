      "explanation_incorrect": "A food chain does not start with animals. It always starts with plants, the producers. Plants make their own food using sunlight, water, and air. Then, plant-eating animals (herbivores) eat the plants, and meat-eating animals (carnivores) eat the herbivores. This is the correct order of a food chain, with plants at the beginning."
