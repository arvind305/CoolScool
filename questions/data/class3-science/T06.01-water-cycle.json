    "text": "The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on Earth. The sun heats water in rivers, lakes, and oceans, causing it to evaporate into water vapor. The vapor rises, cools, and condenses to form clouds. When clouds become heavy, water falls as rain, snow, or hail. This water collects in rivers and oceans, and the cycle repeats.",

      "Evaporation: Sun heats water, turning it into water vapor",

      "explanation_correct": "The water cycle is the continuous movement of water on Earth. This means water is always moving from one place to another, like from the ocean to the clouds and back again. The sun's heat makes the water evaporate and move up, and then it falls back down as rain or snow.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The water cycle is not water moving in a bucket or staying in one place. It is a continuous process where water evaporates, turns into clouds, and then falls back down as rain or snow. The water keeps moving around again and again, never disappearing forever."
