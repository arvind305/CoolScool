    "text": "Four-digit numbers range from 1000 to 9999. Each digit has a place value: thousands (Th), hundreds (H), tens (T), and ones (O). Face value is the digit itself, while place value is the value based on its position. Numbers can be written in standard form (3456) or expanded form (3000 + 400 + 50 + 6).",
    "rules": [
      "A four-digit number has digits in thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones places",
      "Place value = Face value × Position value (e.g., in 5432, place value of 5 is 5000)",
      "Face value is the digit itself regardless of position",
      "Expanded form shows the sum of place values of all digits",
      "To form the greatest number, arrange digits in descending order; for smallest, ascending order (avoid zero at the start)"
