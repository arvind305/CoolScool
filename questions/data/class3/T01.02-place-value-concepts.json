    "text": "Place value is the value of a digit based on its position in a number. In a four-digit number, the positions from right to left are ones, tens, hundreds, and thousands. Understanding place value helps us read, write, and work with numbers by knowing that each position has a value ten times greater than the position to its right.",
    "rules": [
      "The rightmost digit represents ones (1s)",
      "Moving left, each position is 10 times the previous: tens (10s), hundreds (100s), thousands (1000s)",
      "A number can be decomposed into its place value parts (e.g., 3456 = 3000 + 400 + 50 + 6)",
      "Regrouping allows converting between places (e.g., 1 thousand = 10 hundreds = 100 tens = 1000 ones)",
      "The value of a digit depends on its position, not just the digit itself"
