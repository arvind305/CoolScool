    "text": "Rounding is the process of replacing a number with another number that is approximately equal but simpler. When rounding to the nearest 10, we look at the ones digit: if it is 5 or more, we round up; if it is less than 5, we round down. When rounding to the nearest 100, we look at the tens digit. Estimation uses rounding to find approximate answers quickly, which helps us check if our exact calculations are reasonable.",
    "rules": [
      "To round to nearest 10: Look at ones digit. If 0-4, round down. If 5-9, round up.",
      "To round to nearest 100: Look at tens digit. If 0-4, round down. If 5-9, round up.",
      "When estimating sums or differences, round each number first, then calculate.",
      "When estimating products, round the numbers to make multiplication easier.",
      "Use estimation to check if your exact answer makes sense."
