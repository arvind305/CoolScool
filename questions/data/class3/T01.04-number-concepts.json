    "text": "Number concepts help us understand different properties and patterns of numbers. Even numbers can be divided exactly by 2, while odd numbers leave a remainder of 1. Skip counting involves counting in equal steps, and ordinal numbers show position or order (first, second, third, etc.). Recognizing patterns in number sequences helps develop mathematical thinking.",
    "rules": [
      "Even numbers end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8; odd numbers end in 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9",
      "Skip counting means counting by a fixed interval (e.g., 2s: 2, 4, 6, 8...)",
      "Ordinal numbers indicate position (1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th... up to 100th)",
      "Cardinal numbers tell 'how many', ordinal numbers tell 'which position'",
      "Number patterns follow rules where each term relates to previous terms"
