      "explanation_correct": "The value of XIV is 14. In Roman numerals, X represents 10, and V represents 5. When the smaller symbol I comes before the larger symbol V, we subtract 1, so IV represents 4. Therefore, XIV represents 10 + 4, which is 14.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 14. Option A (10) is wrong because X represents 10, but the Roman numeral XIV has an extra I which means 1. Option B (1) is wrong because I represents 1, but the Roman numeral XIV has more symbols. Option C (4) is wrong because the Roman numeral XIV has more symbols than just IV, which represents 4."
