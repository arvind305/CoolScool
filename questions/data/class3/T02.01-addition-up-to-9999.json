  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Addition is the process of combining two or more numbers to find their total or sum. When adding numbers up to 9999, we can use column addition by arranging numbers according to their place values (ones, tens, hundreds, thousands). We may need to regroup (carry) when the sum in any column is 10 or more. Addition follows important properties: commutative (order doesn't matter), associative (grouping doesn't matter), and identity (adding 0 gives the same number).",
    "rules": [
      "Align numbers by place value (ones under ones, tens under tens, etc.)",
      "Add each column starting from the right (ones place)",
      "If a column sum is 10 or more, regroup (carry) to the next column",
      "The order of addends can be changed without changing the sum (commutative property)",
      "Use mental strategies and estimation to check if answers are reasonable"
