    "text": "Subtraction is the process of finding the difference between two numbers by taking away one quantity from another. In Class 3, we learn to subtract numbers up to 9999 (4-digit numbers) using various methods including with and without regrouping (borrowing). We also learn to handle special cases like zeros in the minuend, check our answers using addition, use mental strategies for quick calculations, and apply subtraction to solve real-world word problems.",
    "rules": [
      "Align numbers by place value (ones under ones, tens under tens, etc.)",
      "Subtract from right to left, starting with the ones place",
      "When a digit in the minuend is smaller than the corresponding digit in the subtrahend, borrow 1 from the next higher place value",
      "When borrowing from zero, continue borrowing from the next non-zero digit",
      "Check subtraction by adding the difference to the subtrahend; it should equal the minuend"
