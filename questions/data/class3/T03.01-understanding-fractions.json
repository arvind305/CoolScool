    "text": "A fraction represents a part of a whole. It is written as two numbers separated by a line: the top number is called the numerator (tells how many parts we have) and the bottom number is called the denominator (tells how many equal parts the whole is divided into). For example, in 1/4, we have 1 part out of 4 equal parts. Fractions can be shown using pictures, objects, or on a number line.",
