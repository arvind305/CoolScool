    "text": "A fraction of a collection means taking a part of a group of objects. To find a unit fraction (like 1/2, 1/3, 1/4) of a collection, we divide the total number of objects by the denominator. For example, to find 1/3 of 12 apples, we divide 12 by 3, which gives us 4 apples. This helps us understand that finding a fraction is the same as dividing and sharing equally.",
