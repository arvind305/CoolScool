    "text": "Geometry is the study of shapes, lines, and angles. A point is an exact location in space with no size. A line extends infinitely in both directions, while a line segment has two endpoints and a ray has one endpoint extending infinitely in one direction. Lines can be parallel (never meeting) or intersecting (crossing each other), and can be horizontal, vertical, or perpendicular (meeting at right angles). A right angle measures 90 degrees and looks like the corner of a square.",
