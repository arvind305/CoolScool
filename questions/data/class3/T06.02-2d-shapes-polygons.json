    "text": "2D shapes are flat figures that have length and width but no thickness. Polygons are closed shapes made of straight lines. Common polygons include triangles (3 sides), squares and rectangles (4 sides), pentagons (5 sides), hexagons (6 sides), heptagons (7 sides), and octagons (8 sides). Each polygon has properties like number of sides, vertices (corners), and angles. The area of a shape is the space it covers, measured in square units like cm² or m². Many shapes have line symmetry, where one half is a mirror image of the other half.",
    "rules": [
      "A polygon is a closed shape made only of straight lines",
      "The number of sides equals the number of vertices and angles in a polygon",
      "Area of rectangle = length × breadth (l × b)",
      "Area of square = side × side (s × s)",
      "A line of symmetry divides a shape into two identical halves that are mirror images"
