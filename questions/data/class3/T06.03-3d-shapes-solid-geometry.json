    "text": "3D shapes are solid objects that have length, width, and height. Common 3D shapes include cube, cuboid, sphere, cone, cylinder, triangular prism, rectangular prism, and pyramid. Each 3D shape has specific properties including faces (flat surfaces), edges (where two faces meet), and vertices (corner points). We see 3D shapes all around us in everyday objects like boxes, balls, ice cream cones, and buildings.",
