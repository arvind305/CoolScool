Geometric patterns use shapes like circles, squares, and triangles to create beautiful designs. Tessellations are patterns where shapes fit together perfectly without any gaps or overlaps, like tiles on a floor. Symmetrical designs like rangoli and mandalas have balanced patterns where one half mirrors the other half.",
