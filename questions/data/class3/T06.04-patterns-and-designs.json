    "text": "Patterns and designs are arrangements of shapes, colors, or objects that repeat or follow a rule. Geometric patterns use shapes like circles, squares, and triangles to create beautiful designs. Tessellations are patterns where shapes fit together perfectly without any gaps or overlaps, like tiles on a floor. Symmetrical designs like rangoli and mandalas have balanced patterns where one half mirrors the other half.",
    "rules": [
      "Patterns follow a repeating rule or arrangement",
      "Geometric patterns use basic shapes like circles, squares, triangles, and rectangles",
      "Tessellations cover a surface completely without gaps or overlaps",
      "Symmetrical designs have parts that match when folded or reflected",
      "Patterns can be found in art, nature, and everyday objects"
