    "text": "Data collection involves gathering information through methods like observation, surveys, and questionnaires. Once collected, data must be organized systematically in tables using tally marks and frequency tables. Tally marks are grouped in sets of five (four vertical lines with a diagonal fifth line) to make counting easier. Data can also be grouped into categories to help us understand and analyze information better.",
