Once collected, data must be organized systematically in tables using tally marks and frequency tables. Tally marks are grouped in sets of five (four vertical lines with a diagonal fifth line) to make counting easier. Data can also be grouped into categories to help us understand and analyze information better.",

While A) Information is presented clearly and C) Organized information is simpler to recall are important, they do not directly address the ability to find patterns and draw conclusions, which is the key to analyzing data effectively. B) Can see differences between items quickly is also not the complete answer, as analyzing data goes beyond just identifying differences."
