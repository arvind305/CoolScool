  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Data representation helps us organize and display information in visual forms that are easy to understand. Pictographs use symbols or pictures to represent data, where each symbol can stand for 1, 2, 5, or 10 units. Bar graphs use rectangular bars to show data, and can be drawn vertically (bars going up) or horizontally (bars going sideways). Every graph needs important parts: a title (tells what the graph shows), axes (the lines that form the frame), labels (names for categories), and a scale (tells how much each unit represents).",
    "rules": [
      "In pictographs, always check the scale to know what each symbol represents",
      "Bar graphs must have clearly labeled axes showing what is being measured",
      "The scale must be consistent throughout the graph",
      "Every graph needs a title to explain what data is being shown",
      "Bars in a bar graph should be of equal width and evenly spaced"
