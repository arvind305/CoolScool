    "text": "Number patterns are sequences of numbers that follow a specific rule. In arithmetic sequences, we add or subtract the same number each time. In geometric patterns, we multiply or divide by the same number. Patterns help us predict what comes next and find missing numbers in a sequence.",
    "rules": [
      "Arithmetic patterns use constant addition or subtraction (e.g., 2, 5, 8, 11 adds 3 each time)",
      "Geometric patterns use constant multiplication or division (e.g., 2, 6, 18, 54 multiplies by 3)",
      "Multiplication tables create patterns (e.g., 5, 10, 15, 20 follows the 5 times table)",
      "To find missing terms, identify the rule first, then apply it",
      "Every pattern has a rule that explains how to get from one number to the next"
