    "text": "The human skeletal system is made up of bones that provide support, protection, and enable movement. The skeleton protects vital organs - the skull protects the brain, and the rib cage protects the heart and lungs. The spine (backbone) is made of small bones called vertebrae. Joints are places where two or more bones meet. Different types of joints allow different movements: hinge joints (knee, elbow) work like a door, ball-and-socket joints (shoulder, hip) allow movement in all directions, pivot joints (neck) allow rotation, and fixed joints (skull) do not move. Muscles are attached to bones by tendons and work in pairs to create movement - when one muscle contracts (shortens), the opposite muscle relaxes.",
