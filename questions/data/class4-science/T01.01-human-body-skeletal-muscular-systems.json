    "text": "The human skeletal system is made up of bones that provide support, protection, and enable movement. The skeleton protects vital organs - the skull protects the brain, and the rib cage protects the heart and lungs. The spine (backbone) is made of small bones called vertebrae. Joints are places where two or more bones meet. Different types of joints allow different movements: hinge joints (knee, elbow) work like a door, ball-and-socket joints (shoulder, hip) allow movement in all directions, pivot joints (neck) allow rotation, and fixed joints (skull) do not move. Muscles are attached to bones by tendons and work in pairs to create movement - when one muscle contracts (shortens), the opposite muscle relaxes.",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is 'Protects vital organs', 'Produces blood cells', 'Helps muscles move the body'. This is because the skeleton's main job is to protect the body's important organs like the brain and heart. The skeleton also makes blood cells, and then the muscles use the bones to move the body around.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be 'Helps muscles move the body', 'Protects vital organs', 'Produces blood cells'. This is wrong because the skeleton's most important job is to protect the body's vital organs like the brain and heart. The skeleton comes before the muscles, as the muscles need the bones to be able to move the body. The skeleton also makes blood cells, but this is not its primary function."
