    "text": "Plants reproduce through flowers. A flower has four main parts: sepals (protect the bud), petals (attract insects), stamens (male part with anther and filament), and pistil (female part with stigma, style, and ovary). Pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma, either by self-pollination (same flower or plant) or cross-pollination (different plant). Agents of pollination include wind, water, insects, and birds. After pollination, seeds form inside the ovary, which becomes the fruit. Seeds have three parts: seed coat (protection), cotyledon (food storage), and embryo (baby plant). Seeds are dispersed by wind, water, animals, or explosion to grow away from the parent plant. Germination requires water, air, and warmth.",
