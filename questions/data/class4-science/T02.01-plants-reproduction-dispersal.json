    "text": "Plants reproduce through flowers. A flower has four main parts: sepals (protect the bud), petals (attract insects), stamens (male part with anther and filament), and pistil (female part with stigma, style, and ovary). Pollination is the transfer of pollen from the anther to the stigma, either by self-pollination (same flower or plant) or cross-pollination (different plant). Agents of pollination include wind, water, insects, and birds. After pollination, seeds form inside the ovary, which becomes the fruit. Seeds have three parts: seed coat (protection), cotyledon (food storage), and embryo (baby plant). Seeds are dispersed by wind, water, animals, or explosion to grow away from the parent plant. Germination requires water, air, and warmth.",

Bees and birds typically pollinate flowers that are brightly colored and have a strong smell to attract them. Water can sometimes carry pollen from one plant to another, but this is not the main way that grass flowers are pollinated. The correct answer is that grass flowers are most likely pollinated by the wind, which can easily carry their small, light pollen to other grass plants."

The insects are attracted to the flowers to feed on the nectar, and as they move around the flower, they help transfer the pollen from the stamens to the stigma, which is important for plant reproduction.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement is true because petals are an important part of the flower that help attract insects. Petals are brightly colored and have sweet smells that draw insects like bees and butterflies to the flowers. The insects are attracted to the flowers to feed on the nectar, and as they move around the flower, they help transfer the pollen from the stamens to the stigma, which is important for plant reproduction. If the petals were not there, the flowers would not be able to attract insects and the process of pollination would be much more difficult."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is: 'Pollen is produced in anther', 'Pollen travels to another flower', 'Pollen lands on stigma', 'Pollen moves down the style to ovary'. This is the path of pollen during pollination, where the pollen from the male part (anther) travels to the female part (stigma) to fertilize the ovary and form seeds.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: 'Pollen travels to another flower', 'Pollen is produced in anther', 'Pollen lands on stigma', 'Pollen moves down the style to ovary'. This is wrong because the pollen is first produced in the anther, then it travels to another flower, lands on the stigma, and finally moves down the style to the ovary."
