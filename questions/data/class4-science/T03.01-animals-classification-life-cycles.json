    "text": "Animals can be classified by habitat (terrestrial, aquatic, aerial, amphibians), body covering (fur, feathers, scales, shell), or food habits (herbivores, carnivores, omnivores). Vertebrates have a backbone while invertebrates do not. Some animals undergo metamorphosis - a complete change in body form during their life cycle. A butterfly's life cycle includes egg, caterpillar (larva), pupa (chrysalis), and adult. A frog's life cycle includes egg, tadpole, froglet, and adult frog. The tadpole breathes through gills and has a tail, but the adult frog has lungs and no tail.",
    "rules": [
      "Terrestrial animals live on land, aquatic animals live in water",
      "Amphibians can live both on land and in water",
