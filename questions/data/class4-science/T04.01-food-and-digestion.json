    "text": "Food provides nutrients that our body needs. Carbohydrates (rice, bread) give energy. Proteins (milk, eggs, pulses) help in growth and repair. Fats (butter, oil) provide energy and warmth. Vitamins and minerals protect from diseases. A balanced diet includes all nutrients in the right amounts. Digestion begins in the mouth where teeth chew food and saliva mixes with it. Food travels through the food pipe to the stomach where it is churned. The small intestine absorbs nutrients into blood, and the large intestine absorbs water. We have four types of teeth: incisors (cut), canines (tear), premolars and molars (grind).",
