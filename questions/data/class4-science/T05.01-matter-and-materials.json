    "text": "Matter exists in three states: solid, liquid, and gas. Solids have a definite shape and volume (ice, wood). Liquids have a definite volume but take the shape of their container (water, milk). Gases have no definite shape or volume and fill their container (air, oxygen). Matter can change from one state to another: melting (solid to liquid), freezing (liquid to solid), evaporation/boiling (liquid to gas), and condensation (gas to liquid). The water cycle shows these changes in nature. Changes can be reversible (ice melting, can be refrozen) or irreversible (cooking, burning - cannot go back). Materials can be natural (wood, cotton) or man-made (plastic, glass).",
