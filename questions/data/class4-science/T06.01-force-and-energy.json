    "text": "Force is a push or a pull that can change the state of motion or shape of an object. Types of forces include muscular force (from our muscles), gravitational force (Earth pulling objects down), frictional force (opposes motion between surfaces), and magnetic force (between magnets). Force can start motion, stop motion, change speed, change direction, or change shape. Energy is the ability to do work. Types of energy include heat, light, sound, electrical, and mechanical energy. The Sun is the main source of energy. Energy can change from one form to another (e.g., electrical to light in a bulb). Energy sources can be renewable (sun, wind, water) or non-renewable (coal, oil, gas).",

Friction is a force that goes in the opposite direction of the object's motion, making it harder for the object to keep moving."
