    "text": "Force is a push or a pull that can change the state of motion or shape of an object. Types of forces include muscular force (from our muscles), gravitational force (Earth pulling objects down), frictional force (opposes motion between surfaces), and magnetic force (between magnets). Force can start motion, stop motion, change speed, change direction, or change shape. Energy is the ability to do work. Types of energy include heat, light, sound, electrical, and mechanical energy. The Sun is the main source of energy. Energy can change from one form to another (e.g., electrical to light in a bulb). Energy sources can be renewable (sun, wind, water) or non-renewable (coal, oil, gas).",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Some people may think that friction helps motion, but that is not correct. Friction actually works against the motion of an object, slowing it down. Friction is a force that goes in the opposite direction of the object's motion, making it harder for the object to keep moving."

Frictional force works differently -- it opposes the motion between two surfaces that are touching, like when a ball rolling on the ground slows down. These two forces act in different ways on objects.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Gravity and friction are different types of forces. Gravity does not oppose motion between surfaces -- it pulls objects toward the Earth. Friction does not pull objects downward -- it acts between surfaces to slow down or stop movement. The key difference is that gravity pulls things down, while friction resists sliding motion between surfaces."

      "explanation_correct": "Weight is not a form of energy. Weight is actually a measure of the gravitational force acting on an object -- it tells us how strongly gravity pulls something down. Heat, light, and sound are all proper forms of energy. Many students confuse weight with energy because heavy objects seem powerful, but weight is a force, not energy.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Heat, light, and sound are all forms of energy. Heat energy makes things warm, light energy helps us see, and sound energy lets us hear. Weight is not a form of energy -- it is the force of gravity acting on an object. Even though heavy things seem to have more power, weight itself is a force, not a type of energy."

But wood is actually a renewable source because we can plant new trees and they will grow back over time.

Wood is the one that seems non-renewable because cutting a tree removes it, but trees can be planted again and will grow back, making wood a renewable source."

      "explanation_correct": "Gravity is a non-contact force because it can pull objects toward the Earth without needing to touch them. For example, when you drop a ball, the Earth's gravity pulls it down without any physical contact between the Earth and the ball. Contact forces like friction need the surfaces to be touching.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Gravity is not classified as non-contact because it is strong, because it only works on heavy objects (it works on all objects), or because it is the same as friction (they are different forces). The real reason is that gravity can act on objects from a distance, without needing to touch them, which is what makes it a non-contact force."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "The football was at rest (not moving) before it was kicked. When force was applied by kicking, the ball went from being still to moving. Since the ball had no motion before, this is 'starting motion'. 'Changing direction' only applies when an object is already moving in one direction and force makes it go a different way.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The weight of the ball does not decide whether force starts motion or changes direction. The real reason is about whether the ball was already moving or not. Since the ball was stationary (not moving), the kick started its motion. If the ball had already been rolling and then was kicked sideways, that would be changing direction."

It is not stored as warmth or hotness. When our body digests the food, it releases this stored chemical energy so we can use it to move, play, and do work.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Food is not always cold, and food does give us energy. Heat energy is not found only in fire -- it can be found in many warm objects. The real reason food has chemical energy is that the energy is stored in the chemical bonds of the nutrients in the food, not as warmth. Our body breaks down these chemicals to release the stored energy."
