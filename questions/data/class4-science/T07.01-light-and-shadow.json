    "text": "Light is a form of energy that helps us see. Natural sources include the Sun, stars, fire, and lightning. Artificial sources include bulbs, torches, and candles. Light travels in straight lines and very fast. Objects are classified by how they interact with light: transparent objects let all light pass through (glass, water), translucent objects let some light pass through (frosted glass, oiled paper), and opaque objects block all light (wood, metal). Shadows form when opaque objects block light. A shadow has the same shape as the object and appears on the opposite side of the light source. Shadow size changes with the position of the light source. Reflection is light bouncing off surfaces; smooth shiny surfaces like mirrors reflect light well.",
