    "text": "Sound is produced by vibrations. When objects vibrate, they create sound waves that travel through a medium (air, water, or solids). Sound cannot travel through vacuum (empty space). Sound travels slower than light. Musical instruments produce sound through vibrations - drums through vibrating membranes, guitars through vibrating strings, flutes through vibrating air columns. Sound has two main characteristics: loudness (loud or soft, depends on energy) and pitch (high or low, depends on speed of vibration). Pleasant sounds like music are enjoyable, while unpleasant sounds (noise) like traffic can cause noise pollution, leading to hearing problems and stress.",
