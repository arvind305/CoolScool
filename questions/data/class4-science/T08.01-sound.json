    "text": "Sound is produced by vibrations. When objects vibrate, they create sound waves that travel through a medium (air, water, or solids). Sound cannot travel through vacuum (empty space). Sound travels slower than light. Musical instruments produce sound through vibrations - drums through vibrating membranes, guitars through vibrating strings, flutes through vibrating air columns. Sound has two main characteristics: loudness (loud or soft, depends on energy) and pitch (high or low, depends on speed of vibration). Pleasant sounds like music are enjoyable, while unpleasant sounds (noise) like traffic can cause noise pollution, leading to hearing problems and stress.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Sound is not produced by light, heat, or electricity. Light, heat, and electricity are different types of energy that don't create the vibrations needed to produce sound waves. Only vibrating objects can create sound waves that we can hear."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Sound does not travel faster than light. Light is a form of energy that can travel through empty space, called a vacuum, at a very high speed of about 300,000 km per second.

Since there is no air or any medium in space, sound cannot travel, and astronauts cannot talk to each other without special equipment like radios.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The other options are not correct. Space is not too dark for astronauts to talk (option A), and their helmets are not too thick to allow them to talk (option D). While it is very cold in space (option C), the cold temperature does not prevent sound from traveling. The main reason astronauts cannot talk to each other in space without special equipment is that space is a vacuum, with no medium for sound to travel through."

Light travels at a very fast speed of about 300,000 kilometers per second, while sound travels much slower at about 340 meters per second. This is why you can see lightning before you hear the thunder - the light travels faster than the sound.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Sound does not travel faster than light. Light is the fastest thing in the universe, traveling at a speed of about 300,000 kilometers per second. Sound, on the other hand, travels much slower at about 340 meters per second. This is why you can see lightning before you hear the thunder - the light reaches you first before the sound does."

This makes the sound softer and quieter. In contrast, a shout has more energy from the stronger vibrations of our vocal cords, resulting in louder, more powerful sound waves.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "A whisper is not softer than a shout because it has more energy. Many people think that a whisper is quieter because it has less energy, but this is not true. In fact, a whisper has less energy than a shout, which is why it is softer. The vibrations in our vocal cords are weaker when we whisper, creating sound waves with less energy and resulting in a quieter, softer sound."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement 'Fast vibrations produce low-pitched sounds' is incorrect. This is because the speed of vibration and the pitch of the sound are related in the opposite way. The faster an object vibrates, the higher the pitch of the sound it creates. For example, a guitar string vibrating quickly produces a high-pitched note, while a guitar string vibrating slowly produces a low-pitched note."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Some musical instruments like drums or guitars make sound by vibrating solid parts, like the drum membrane or the strings. But a flute is different - it produces sound by making the air inside it vibrate, not any solid parts of the instrument. The air vibrations inside the flute are what create the sound we hear when someone plays the flute."
