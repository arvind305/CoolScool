    "text": "The Sun is a star at the center of our solar system, providing light and heat to Earth. Earth rotates on its axis once every 24 hours, causing day and night. Earth revolves around the Sun in about 365 days (one year), causing seasons due to Earth's tilted axis. The Moon is Earth's natural satellite, revolving around Earth in about 28 days. The Moon reflects sunlight and shows different phases: new moon, crescent, half moon, gibbous, and full moon. Our solar system has 8 planets in order from the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Stars are distant suns, and constellations are patterns formed by groups of stars.",

This is why it is day in India while it is night in America at the same time.",

Option C is wrong because whether a place is colder or warmer does not determine if it is day or night. Option D is wrong because the distance between India and the Sun does not affect whether it is day or night in India."

The Moon is the only one that does not produce light. It just reflects sunlight, which is why it seems to shine at night."

      "explanation_correct": "Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, so many people think it must be the hottest. But Mercury is actually NOT the hottest planet. Venus is hotter than Mercury because Venus has thick clouds that trap heat, like a blanket. So being closest to the Sun does not always mean being the hottest.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The question asks which planet is closest to the Sun but is NOT the hottest. Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, but Venus is actually hotter because of its thick atmosphere that traps heat. Earth and Mars are farther from the Sun and are not the closest. Mercury is the correct answer because it seems like it should be the hottest, but it is not."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Earth's rotation causes day and night because it spins on its axis every 24 hours. As it spins, the side facing the Sun gets sunlight (day) and the side facing away is dark (night). Seasons are caused by a different movement: revolution around the Sun with a tilted axis.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Rotation does not make Earth go around the Sun. That is revolution, which takes 365 days. Rotation does not tilt Earth's axis or change the distance from the Sun. Rotation simply means Earth is spinning in place, which makes the Sun appear to rise and set, giving us day and night."

A satellite is any object that orbits around a planet, and since the Moon orbits Earth, it is Earth's natural satellite.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Being made of rock does not decide if something is a planet or a satellite. Being bright at night or having no atmosphere also does not determine this. What matters is what the Moon orbits around. Since the Moon goes around Earth (a planet) and not directly around the Sun, it is called a satellite."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Stars are actually much farther away than the planets in our solar system, not closer. Stars do not orbit around our Sun. Stars are also much bigger than planets, not smaller. The real reason stars are called distant suns is that they produce their own light and heat, just like our Sun."
