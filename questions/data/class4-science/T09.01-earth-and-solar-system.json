    "text": "The Sun is a star at the center of our solar system, providing light and heat to Earth. Earth rotates on its axis once every 24 hours, causing day and night. Earth revolves around the Sun in about 365 days (one year), causing seasons due to Earth's tilted axis. The Moon is Earth's natural satellite, revolving around Earth in about 28 days. The Moon reflects sunlight and shows different phases: new moon, crescent, half moon, gibbous, and full moon. Our solar system has 8 planets in order from the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Stars are distant suns, and constellations are patterns formed by groups of stars.",

As Earth rotates on its axis every 24 hours, one side of Earth is facing the Sun (day) while the other side is facing away from the Sun (night). This is why it is day in India while it is night in America at the same time.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect options are not correct. Option A is wrong because the Sun does not actually move to different places - it is Earth that rotates, causing day and night. Option C is wrong because whether a place is colder or warmer does not determine if it is day or night. Option D is wrong because the distance between India and the Sun does not affect whether it is day or night in India."

Some people may think this is false because they confuse the Moon's rotation around its own axis (which takes about 27 days) with its revolution around the Earth (which takes about 28 days).
