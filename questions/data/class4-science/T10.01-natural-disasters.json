    "text": "Natural disasters are harmful events caused by nature that cannot be prevented but can be prepared for. Earthquakes are sudden shakings of Earth's surface caused by movements inside the Earth. Floods occur when water covers normally dry land due to heavy rain or overflowing rivers. Droughts happen when there is no rain for a long time, causing water shortage. Cyclones are strong rotating winds with heavy rain. Thunderstorms bring lightning and thunder, which can be dangerous. Safety measures include staying indoors during storms, moving to higher ground during floods, and having an emergency kit with water, food, flashlight, and first aid supplies.",
