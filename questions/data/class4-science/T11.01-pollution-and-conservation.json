    "text": "Pollution is the contamination of the environment by harmful substances. Air pollution comes from vehicle smoke, factories, and burning garbage. Water pollution is caused by chemicals, sewage, and garbage in water. Land pollution results from plastic and garbage on land. Noise pollution is unwanted loud sound from traffic and machines. All types of pollution harm health and the environment. Conservation means protecting and saving natural resources for the future. The three Rs help: Reduce (use less), Reuse (use again), and Recycle (make new from old). We can protect the environment by planting trees, using less plastic, saving water and electricity, and using public transport.",
