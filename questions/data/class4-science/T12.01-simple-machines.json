    "text": "Simple machines are devices that make work easier by changing the direction or amount of force needed. There are six types of simple machines: lever, pulley, wheel and axle, inclined plane, wedge, and screw. A lever is a rod that rotates around a fixed point called the fulcrum (examples: see-saw, scissors, bottle opener). An inclined plane is a sloped surface that makes it easier to move objects up or down (examples: ramps, slides). A wedge is like two inclined planes joined together and is used for cutting or splitting (examples: knife, axe, nail). A pulley is a wheel with a rope that helps lift heavy objects (examples: flagpole, well). A wheel and axle is a wheel attached to a rod and helps move or turn things (examples: door knob, steering wheel). A screw is an inclined plane wrapped around a cylinder and is used for holding things together (examples: screws, jar lids).",

This is because pulleys and ramps help with lifting and moving up, while knives and axes are used for cutting and splitting.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: ramp (C), pulley (B), axe (D), knife (A). While ramps and pulleys do help with lifting and moving, the axe (D) is actually used for splitting, not cutting like a knife (A). The correct order is pulley, ramp, knife, axe, as this goes from lifting to cutting and splitting."
