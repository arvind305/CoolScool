      "explanation_correct": "The correct figures for Eight lakh forty-five thousand six hundred seventy-eight is 845678. This is because in the Indian place-value system, 'lakh' means 100,000, so 8 lakhs is 800,000. Adding the 45,000 and 678 gives us the full number 845,678.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option B (320000) is incorrect because it does not represent Eight lakh forty-five thousand six hundred seventy-eight. Option C (100001) is incorrect because it is a different number entirely. Option D (999999) is also incorrect because it is a much larger number than the one given in the question."
