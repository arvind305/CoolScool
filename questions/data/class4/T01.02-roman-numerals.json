    "text": "Roman numerals use seven symbols: I=1, V=5, X=10, L=50, C=100, D=500, M=1000. Numbers are formed using addition (larger before smaller: VI=6) and subtraction principles (smaller before larger: IV=4). Valid subtractive combinations are IV, IX, XL, XC, CD, CM.",
    "rules": [
      "Addition rule: When a smaller symbol follows a larger one, add the values (e.g., VI = 5 + 1 = 6)",
