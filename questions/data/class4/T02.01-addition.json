We can add numbers without carrying (when digits in each place value sum to less than 10) or with carrying (regrouping when the sum is 10 or more). Addition follows important properties: commutative (order doesn't matter), associative (grouping doesn't matter), and additive identity (adding 0 gives the same number).",

      "Align numbers by place value (ones under ones, tens under tens, etc.)",
