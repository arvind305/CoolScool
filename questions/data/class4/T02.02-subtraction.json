    "text": "Subtraction is the operation of finding the difference between two numbers. It can be performed with or without regrouping (borrowing). When subtracting larger numbers, we may need to borrow from the next higher place value. Subtraction has properties like subtracting 0 leaves the number unchanged, and subtracting a number from itself gives 0.",

      "When borrowing, reduce the higher place value by 1 and add 10 to the current place value",
