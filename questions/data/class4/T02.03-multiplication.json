    "text": "Multiplication is repeated addition. When we multiply two numbers, the first number (multiplicand) is added to itself as many times as the second number (multiplier). For example, 5 × 3 means adding 5 three times: 5 + 5 + 5 = 15. Multiplication has important properties: commutative (order doesn't matter), associative (grouping doesn't matter), and distributive (breaking numbers apart). We can multiply large numbers step by step and estimate products by rounding.",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct answer is B) 27,648. To calculate 3,456 × 8, we can multiply each digit of 3,456 by 8 and then add the results. 3 × 8 = 24, 4 × 8 = 32, 5 × 8 = 40, and 6 × 8 = 48. Putting it all together, we get 24,000 + 3,200 + 400 + 48 = 27,648.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The other options are incorrect because they do not match the step-by-step calculation of 3,456 × 8. Option A) 32,592 is wrong because it does not take into account the place value of the digits in 3,456. Option C) 45,060 and Option D) 23,673 are also wrong because they do not correctly multiply 3,456 by 8."
