Factors are numbers that divide another number exactly (e.g., factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12). Even numbers are divisible by 2, odd numbers are not. Prime numbers have exactly 2 factors (1 and itself), composite numbers have more than 2 factors. Divisibility tests help determine if a number is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10.",
