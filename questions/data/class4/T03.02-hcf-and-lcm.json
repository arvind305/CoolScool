    "text": "HCF (Highest Common Factor) is the largest number that divides two numbers exactly. LCM (Lowest Common Multiple) is the smallest number that both numbers divide into exactly. We can find HCF by listing common factors or using long division method. We can find LCM by listing common multiples or using long division method. Both HCF and LCM have properties that help us understand number relationships.",
    "rules": [
      "HCF is the largest number that divides both numbers exactly with no remainder.",
      "LCM is the smallest number that both numbers divide into exactly.",
      "To find HCF by listing: list all factors of both numbers, find common factors, choose the highest.",
      "To find LCM by listing: list multiples of both numbers, find common multiples, choose the lowest.",
      "HCF by long division: divide the larger number by the smaller, then divide the divisor by the remainder, repeat until remainder is zero. The last divisor is the HCF.",
      "LCM by long division: divide by common factors, multiply all divisors and remaining numbers.",
      "HCF of two numbers is always less than or equal to the smaller number.",
      "LCM of two numbers is always greater than or equal to the larger number.",
      "All numbers in this topic are within 1000. Work with 2 numbers only."
