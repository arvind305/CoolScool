    "text": "Measurement helps us find how long, heavy, or much space something takes. We use standard units like millimetre (mm), centimetre (cm), metre (m), and kilometre (km) for length; gram (g) and kilogram (kg) for mass; and millilitre (ml) and litre (l) for capacity. We can add and subtract these measurements to solve problems.",
