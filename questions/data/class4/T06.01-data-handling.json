Pictographs use pictures or symbols to show data, where each symbol represents a certain number of items. Bar graphs use rectangular bars of different heights to display data, with labeled axes showing categories and values. Tables help organize data systematically before creating pictographs or bar graphs.",

      "In pictographs, each symbol represents a fixed number of items (called the scale)",
      "Read the key or legend to understand what each symbol represents",

      "The height or length of each bar represents the quantity for that category",
