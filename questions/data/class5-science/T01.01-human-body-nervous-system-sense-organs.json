    "text": "The nervous system controls and coordinates all body activities. It consists of the brain (control centre), spinal cord (connects brain to body), and nerves (carry messages). The brain controls thinking, memory, and body functions. We have five sense organs: eyes (sight), ears (hearing), nose (smell), tongue (taste), and skin (touch). Each sense organ has specialized receptors. The eye has parts like cornea, pupil, lens, and retina. The ear has outer ear, ear canal, and eardrum. Reflexes are quick automatic responses like blinking. We must protect and care for our sense organs.",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is: Light enters through the cornea, passes through the pupil, gets focused by the lens, and finally forms an image on the retina. This is the path light takes to reach the retina, which is the light-sensitive layer at the back of the eye.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Image formed on retina, Light enters through cornea, Light passes through pupil, Lens focuses light. This is wrong because light first enters the eye through the cornea, then passes through the pupil, gets focused by the lens, and only then forms an image on the retina at the back of the eye."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The order from largest to smallest is not 'Individual nerve, Spinal cord, Brain'. The brain is the largest part of the nervous system, as it is the main control center that coordinates all body functions. The spinal cord is larger than individual nerves, as it connects the brain to the rest of the body and allows communication between them."
