A cell has three main parts: cell membrane (outer covering), cytoplasm (jelly-like substance), and nucleus (controls cell activities). Plant cells have additional features: cell wall (for support), chloroplasts (for making food), and larger vacuoles. Animal cells lack cell wall and chloroplasts. Unicellular organisms like amoeba and bacteria are made of one cell. Multicellular organisms like plants and animals are made of many cells working together.",

Atoms are the smallest particles of matter, but they cannot carry out the basic functions of life on their own. Organs and tissues are made up of many cells working together, but they are not the basic unit of life. The cell is the basic unit of life because it is the smallest structure that can perform all the essential life processes."

This is because all living organisms, whether they are plants, animals, or single-celled organisms like bacteria, are made up of tiny units called cells. Cells are the basic building blocks of life, and every living thing, no matter how small or large, is composed of one or more cells. Some people might think that this is not true, but this is a misconception. All living things, from the smallest bacteria to the largest whales, are made of cells."

This is because a cell is the basic unit of life, and tissues are made of many cells working together. Organs are made of multiple tissues, and organisms are the largest, made of many organs that work together as a whole living thing.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Organism, Organ, Cell, Tissue. This is wrong because organisms are the largest, made of many organs, and organs are made of many tissues. Cells are the smallest, basic unit of life, and tissues are made of many cells working together. The correct order from smallest to largest is Cell, Tissue, Organ, Organism."

This is because the cell wall is the outermost layer that provides support and protection to the plant cell. Inside the cell wall is the cell membrane, which controls what goes in and out of the cell. The cytoplasm is the jelly-like substance inside the cell membrane, and the nucleus is the control center located within the cytoplasm.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be placing the nucleus on the outer side of the cell. This is not correct because the nucleus is the control center of the cell and is located in the innermost part, inside the cytoplasm. The correct order from outer to inner is cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm, and then the nucleus."
