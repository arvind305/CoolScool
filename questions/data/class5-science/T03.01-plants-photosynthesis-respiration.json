    "text": "Plants make their own food through photosynthesis. This process requires sunlight, water (absorbed by roots), carbon dioxide (from air through stomata), and chlorophyll (green pigment in leaves). The products are glucose (food) and oxygen (released into air). Plants also respire to release energy from food. Respiration uses oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. Photosynthesis occurs only during the day (needs light) in green parts of plants. Respiration occurs all the time (day and night) in all parts of plants. Plants are important as they produce oxygen and food for all living things.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Plants do not need sunlight just to stay warm or dry their leaves. The sunlight is crucial for the process of photosynthesis, where plants use the energy from sunlight to make their own food. Without sunlight, plants would not be able to produce the glucose that they need to survive and grow."

Respiration uses oxygen and glucose to release energy, producing carbon dioxide. Both processes happen in the green parts of the plant during the day.",

They also respire (use oxygen and release carbon dioxide) to get energy from the food they make. Option B is incorrect because plants do not only respire during the day - they also perform photosynthesis.

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is carbon dioxide goes in, glucose is made, and oxygen comes out. This is because during photosynthesis, the plant takes in carbon dioxide and uses the energy from sunlight to turn it into glucose, which is the plant's food. As a result, the plant releases oxygen back into the air.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be oxygen comes out, glucose is made, carbon dioxide goes in. This is wrong because the first step in photosynthesis is the plant taking in carbon dioxide from the air, not oxygen coming out. The plant then uses the carbon dioxide, along with water and sunlight, to make glucose as its food, and only then does it release oxygen back into the air."
