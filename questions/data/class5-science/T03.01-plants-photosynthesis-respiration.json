    "text": "Plants make their own food through photosynthesis. This process requires sunlight, water (absorbed by roots), carbon dioxide (from air through stomata), and chlorophyll (green pigment in leaves). The products are glucose (food) and oxygen (released into air). Plants also respire to release energy from food. Respiration uses oxygen and releases carbon dioxide. Photosynthesis occurs only during the day (needs light) in green parts of plants. Respiration occurs all the time (day and night) in all parts of plants. Plants are important as they produce oxygen and food for all living things.",
