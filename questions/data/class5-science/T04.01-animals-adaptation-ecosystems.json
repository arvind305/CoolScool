    "text": "Adaptation refers to special features that help animals survive in their habitat. Desert animals like camels have humps to store fat and can survive without water. Aquatic animals like fish have gills and fins. Polar animals like polar bears have thick fur for warmth. An ecosystem includes living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) components interacting together. Food chains show how energy flows from producers (plants) to consumers (animals) to decomposers. Biodiversity (variety of life) is important because each organism has a role in the ecosystem.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "The special features that help an animal survive are called adaptations. Adaptations are special body parts or behaviors that allow an animal to live and thrive in its habitat. For example, a camel's hump stores fat that it can use for energy when there is no water around.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Habitats, ecosystems, and food chains are not the same as adaptations. Habitats are the environments where animals live. Ecosystems include both living and non-living things in an environment. Food chains show how energy flows from plants to animals. Adaptations are the special features that help an animal survive and do well in its habitat."

This is the natural order of a simple food chain.",

This is wrong because the cat is a tertiary consumer that eats the bird, which is a secondary consumer. The caterpillar is a primary consumer that eats the tree leaves, which are the producers. The correct order is always from the producer to the primary, secondary, and tertiary consumers."

This is wrong because eagles are the top consumers that eat rabbits, and rabbits are consumers that eat the grass, which is the producer.
