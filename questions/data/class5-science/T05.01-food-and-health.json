    "text": "Our body needs six nutrients: carbohydrates (energy), proteins (growth and repair), fats (stored energy), vitamins (protection from diseases), minerals (body functions), and water (essential for all processes). A balanced diet contains all nutrients in right amounts. Deficiency diseases occur when nutrients are lacking: scurvy (Vitamin C), rickets (Vitamin D), anaemia (iron), goitre (iodine), night blindness (Vitamin A). Communicable diseases spread through air, water, contact, or food. Good hygiene practices like handwashing prevent diseases. Basic first aid includes cleaning cuts, cooling burns, and knowing when to seek help.",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is: Germs enter body, Germs multiply, Person becomes sick. This is because germs (like viruses or bacteria) first need to get into your body, then they multiply and grow inside you, and finally you become sick as a result.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Person becomes sick, Germs enter body, Germs multiply. This is wrong because the germs have to first enter your body before they can multiply and make you sick. The germs don't just appear inside you after you become sick. They have to infect you first, then they spread and grow, which leads to you getting the illness."

Then, our body breaks down and digests the food. Finally, the energy from the food is released and used by our body.",

This is not the right order because energy is not released until after the food has been digested. The correct order is to first eat the food, then digest the food, and finally the energy from the food is released and used by our body."
