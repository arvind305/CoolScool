    "text": "Matter exists in three states: solid (definite shape and volume, tightly packed particles), liquid (definite volume but takes container shape, particles less closely packed), and gas (no definite shape or volume, particles far apart). Changes of state include: melting (solid to liquid), freezing (liquid to solid), evaporation (liquid to gas), condensation (gas to liquid), and sublimation (solid to gas directly). Physical changes are reversible with no new substance formed. Chemical changes produce new substances and are usually irreversible. The water cycle shows natural changes: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection.",

Precipitation is when these water droplets fall back down to Earth as rain, snow or hail. Collection is the process of water accumulating in lakes, rivers and oceans. Evaporation, where the sun's heat turns liquid water into water vapour, is the correct process that makes water from oceans become vapour in the water cycle."

The cold surface cooled the water vapour, causing it to change from a gas to tiny liquid water droplets on the outside of the bottle.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The water did not leak from inside the bottle. The droplets formed on the outside. It is also not evaporation (liquid to gas) or freezing (liquid to solid). The warm air around the cold bottle contains water vapour, and when this vapour touches the cold bottle surface, it cools down and condenses into liquid water droplets."

Even though the paper looks different (smaller pieces), no new substance has been formed. The small pieces are still paper with the same properties. A change in shape or size alone does not make it a chemical change. Only when a new substance is created is it a chemical change.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Meera is wrong because tearing paper only changes its shape and size, not the substance itself. The torn pieces are still paper. A chemical change requires that a new substance with different properties is formed, like when paper is burned and turns into ash and smoke. Simply changing the shape or size of something is a physical change."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Burning a candle, rusting of iron, and cooking an egg are all chemical changes because new substances are formed in each case.

      "explanation_incorrect": "Gas particles are not heavier than solid particles, and gases are not always hotter than solids. Solids are not always bigger than gases either.

This cold temperature causes the water vapour to condense (change from gas to tiny liquid water droplets), which group together to form clouds. This is the condensation step of the water cycle.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Water vapour is actually lighter than dry air, so it rises easily. The wind alone does not carry all water vapour upward, and the sun does not pull water vapour towards it.
