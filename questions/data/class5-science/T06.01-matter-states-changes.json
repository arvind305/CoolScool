    "text": "Matter exists in three states: solid (definite shape and volume, tightly packed particles), liquid (definite volume but takes container shape, particles less closely packed), and gas (no definite shape or volume, particles far apart). Changes of state include: melting (solid to liquid), freezing (liquid to solid), evaporation (liquid to gas), condensation (gas to liquid), and sublimation (solid to gas directly). Physical changes are reversible with no new substance formed. Chemical changes produce new substances and are usually irreversible. The water cycle shows natural changes: evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and collection.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Condensation is when water vapour in the air cools down and turns back into liquid water droplets, such as in clouds. Precipitation is when these water droplets fall back down to Earth as rain, snow or hail. Collection is the process of water accumulating in lakes, rivers and oceans. Evaporation, where the sun's heat turns liquid water into water vapour, is the correct process that makes water from oceans become vapour in the water cycle."

      "explanation_correct": "In a solid, the particles are tightly packed and can only vibrate in place. In a liquid, the particles are less closely packed and can move around each other. In a gas, the particles are far apart and can move freely in all directions. So the order from least to most freely moving particles is solid, liquid, gas.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be gas, liquid, solid. This is wrong because in a gas, the particles are farthest apart and can move the most freely, while in a solid the particles are tightly packed and can only vibrate in place. The correct order from least to most freely moving particles is solid, liquid, gas."
