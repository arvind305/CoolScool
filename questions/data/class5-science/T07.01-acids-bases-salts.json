    "text": "Acids taste sour and are found in lemon juice, vinegar, and orange juice. Bases taste bitter and feel soapy, like soap and baking soda. Indicators like litmus paper help identify acids and bases: acids turn blue litmus red, bases turn red litmus blue. Natural indicators include turmeric and china rose. Neutralisation occurs when acid and base react to form salt and water. Common salts include table salt (sodium chloride) and baking soda. Acids, bases, and salts have many uses in daily life including cooking, cleaning, and food preservation.",
