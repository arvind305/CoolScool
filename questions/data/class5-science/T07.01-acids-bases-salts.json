    "text": "Acids taste sour and are found in lemon juice, vinegar, and orange juice. Bases taste bitter and feel soapy, like soap and baking soda. Indicators like litmus paper help identify acids and bases: acids turn blue litmus red, bases turn red litmus blue. Natural indicators include turmeric and china rose. Neutralisation occurs when acid and base react to form salt and water. Common salts include table salt (sodium chloride) and baking soda. Acids, bases, and salts have many uses in daily life including cooking, cleaning, and food preservation.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Lemon juice, vinegar, and orange juice are all acids because they taste sour. Baking soda is the exception here because it is a base, even though it is a common kitchen ingredient. Not everything in the kitchen is an acid."

Acids like vinegar prevent bacteria from growing in food, which keeps the pickle safe to eat for months. Bases do not have this ability, which is why vinegar is chosen over baking soda."
