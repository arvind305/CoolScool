    "text": "Force is a push or pull that can change an object's motion, shape, or direction. Types of forces include: muscular (from muscles), gravitational (pulls objects toward Earth), frictional (opposes motion), and magnetic (from magnets). Contact forces require physical contact; non-contact forces act from a distance. Work is done when force moves an object. Energy is the ability to do work. Forms of energy include: kinetic (motion), potential (stored), heat, light, sound, and electrical. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.",

      "explanation_correct": "When Rohan turns on the lamp, electrical energy from the wall socket flows through the wire to the bulb. Inside the bulb, this electrical energy is transformed into light energy (which helps Rohan study) and heat energy (which makes the bulb feel warm). This is an example of energy transformation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A reverses the transformation. The lamp does not change light into electricity; it changes electricity into light. Option C is wrong because there is no heat-to-sound conversion happening in a lamp. Option D describes a change between motion and stored energy, which is not what happens in a lamp."

Force can change the shape of an object, and this is exactly what happened here. The clay's colour, weight, and temperature stay the same.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Pressing clay does not change its colour, which depends on the material. It does not change its weight because no clay was added or removed. It does not change its temperature because pressing does not heat or cool the clay noticeably. The correct answer is that the force changed the shape of the clay."
