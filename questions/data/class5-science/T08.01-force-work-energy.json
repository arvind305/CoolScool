    "text": "Force is a push or pull that can change an object's motion, shape, or direction. Types of forces include: muscular (from muscles), gravitational (pulls objects toward Earth), frictional (opposes motion), and magnetic (from magnets). Contact forces require physical contact; non-contact forces act from a distance. Work is done when force moves an object. Energy is the ability to do work. Forms of energy include: kinetic (motion), potential (stored), heat, light, sound, and electrical. Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed from one form to another.",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is Foot applies force, Ball moves, Ball changes direction. This is because when you kick a ball, your foot first applies a force to the ball, which then makes the ball move, and this change in motion also causes the ball to change direction.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Ball moves, Foot applies force, Ball changes direction. This is wrong because the foot has to first apply a force to the ball before the ball can start moving. The ball can only change direction after it has started moving due to the force applied by the foot."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is: Light energy captured, Food is made, Chemical energy stored. This is because plants use the light energy from the sun to make their own food through a process called photosynthesis. The food they make is in the form of chemical energy, which the plant then stores for later use.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Chemical energy stored, Light energy captured, Food is made. This is not correct because the plants first capture the light energy from the sun, then use that energy to make their own food, and finally store that food as chemical energy. The process always starts with the plant capturing light energy, then making food, and finally storing the chemical energy."

This is not correct because gravitational force is a non-contact force that acts across a distance, while magnetic force also acts across a distance through magnetic fields.
