    "text": "Heat is a form of energy that flows from hot to cold objects. Temperature measures how hot or cold something is. A thermometer measures temperature in Celsius (0C = freezing, 100C = boiling water). Heat transfers by: conduction (through solids, particles pass heat), convection (through fluids, hot rises, cold sinks), and radiation (without medium, like Sun's heat). Conductors like metals allow heat to pass easily. Insulators like wood, plastic, rubber do not. Heat causes materials to expand; cooling causes contraction.",

      "explanation_correct": "Copper is the best conductor of heat, allowing heat to pass through it easily. Wood is a good insulator, not allowing heat to pass through it easily. Plastic is the best insulator, which does not allow heat to pass through it at all. So the correct order from best conductor to best insulator is: Copper, Wood, Plastic.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Plastic, Wood, Copper. Plastic is the best insulator, not allowing heat to pass through it easily. Wood is also a good insulator, but not as good as plastic. Copper is the best conductor of heat, allowing heat to pass through it easily, so it should be placed first in the order."

      "explanation_correct": "The temperatures are arranged from lowest to highest: Ice (0°C), Room temperature (around 25°C), and Water boiling (100°C). This makes sense because ice is the coldest, room temperature is in the middle, and boiling water is the hottest.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "If the temperatures were arranged from Ice, Water boiling, and then Room temperature, that would not be correct. Ice is the coldest at 0°C, but Water boiling is hotter than Room temperature, which is around 25°C. So the right order from lowest to highest is Ice, Room temperature, and then Water boiling."

This is not correct because for heat to flow from hot to cold, the hot and cold objects must first come into contact with each other. Only then can the heat transfer happen, until the temperatures become equal."
