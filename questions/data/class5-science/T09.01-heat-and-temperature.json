    "text": "Heat is a form of energy that flows from hot to cold objects. Temperature measures how hot or cold something is. A thermometer measures temperature in Celsius (0C = freezing, 100C = boiling water). Heat transfers by: conduction (through solids, particles pass heat), convection (through fluids, hot rises, cold sinks), and radiation (without medium, like Sun's heat). Conductors like metals allow heat to pass easily. Insulators like wood, plastic, rubber do not. Heat causes materials to expand; cooling causes contraction.",

      "explanation_correct": "When Rohan ran hot water over the metal lid, the heat caused the metal to expand slightly. Metal expands faster than glass when heated. This expansion loosened the lid's grip on the glass jar, making it easier to twist open. This is a practical use of the fact that materials expand when heated.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because being wet and slippery alone would not loosen a very tight lid. Option C is wrong because hot water does not dissolve metal. Option D is wrong because the hot water was run on the lid, not the jar, and the key effect is the expansion of the metal lid, not contraction of the glass."

      "explanation_correct": "The hot water at the bottom of the pot rises to the top because of convection. When the stove heats the water at the bottom, it becomes lighter and rises. The cooler water at the top sinks to take its place. This circular movement of water is convection, and it is why Meera sees bubbles rising from the bottom.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Conduction is the transfer of heat through solids by particles passing heat to neighbours -- it is how heat moves through the steel pot itself, but not how the water circulates. Radiation is heat transfer without a medium. Evaporation is the changing of liquid water to water vapour at the surface. The rising of hot water and sinking of cool water is convection."

The hand loses heat, which is why it feels cold, but it is heat that is moving, not cold.",
