    "text": "Light is a form of energy that enables us to see. Luminous objects produce their own light (Sun, stars, bulb). Non-luminous objects do not (Moon, planets). Light travels in straight lines. Materials are classified as: transparent (light passes through completely), translucent (some light passes), opaque (no light passes). Reflection is bouncing of light from a surface; plane mirrors produce same-size, laterally inverted images. Refraction is bending of light when passing between different media. Shadows form when opaque objects block light; umbra is the dark part, penumbra is lighter. Solar eclipse occurs when Moon blocks Sun; lunar eclipse when Earth blocks sunlight to Moon.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The penumbra is not the darkest part of the shadow. The umbra, which is the completely dark part where no light reaches, is the darkest. The penumbra is the lighter area around the umbra where some light still reaches. So, the correct order from darkest to lightest is umbra, penumbra."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is: Light travels in original direction, Light enters new medium, Light bends. This is because when light passes from one medium (like air) to another medium (like water), it bends or refracts at the boundary between the two media. The bending of light is the last step in the process of light refraction.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order is: Light bends, Light enters new medium, Light travels in original direction. This is wrong because light first enters the new medium, then it bends at the boundary between the two media. The bending happens after light enters the new medium, not before. The light does not continue to travel in the original direction after refraction."
