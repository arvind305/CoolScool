    "text": "Sound is produced by vibrating objects. It needs a medium (solid, liquid, or gas) to travel and cannot travel through vacuum. Sound travels fastest in solids and slowest in gases. Loudness depends on amplitude (how much the object vibrates) - larger amplitude means louder sound. Pitch depends on frequency (how fast the object vibrates) - higher frequency means higher pitch. Musical instruments produce sound through vibrating strings, air columns, or membranes. Music has regular vibrations while noise has irregular vibrations. Noise pollution from traffic, factories, and loudspeakers causes hearing damage and health problems. We can reduce noise by using barriers and reducing volume.",

This is wrong because the sitar produces sound through vibrating strings, not air or membranes. The flute produces sound through vibrating air, not strings or membranes.
