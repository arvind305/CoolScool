    "text": "Electric current is the flow of electricity through conductors. A simple electric circuit needs: cell/battery (source), wire (path), bulb (device), and switch (controller). A closed circuit allows current to flow; an open circuit does not. Electrical conductors (metals, water) allow electricity to flow; insulators (rubber, plastic, wood) do not. Magnets are made of natural (lodestone) or artificial materials. Magnets have two poles (North and South), attract iron/nickel/cobalt, and have directive property. Like poles repel, unlike poles attract. Electromagnets are made by coiling wire around iron and passing current; they can be switched on and off.",

      "explanation_correct": "The advantage of an electromagnet over a permanent magnet is that an electromagnet can be turned on and off by controlling the electric current flowing through it. This allows you to control when the electromagnet is 'active' and when it is 'inactive', which is very useful for many applications.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option B is correct because electromagnets are made by passing an electric current through a coil of wire wrapped around an iron core. This creates a magnetic field that can be turned on and off by controlling the electric current. Permanent magnets, on the other hand, always have a fixed magnetic field that cannot be turned on and off. This makes electromagnets more flexible and useful in many applications where you need to control the magnetic field."

The attractive force between opposite poles is stronger than the repulsive force between like poles.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be North-North poles, then North-South poles. This is wrong because like magnetic poles (North-North) repel each other, while unlike magnetic poles (North-South) attract each other. The attractive force between opposite poles is stronger than the repulsive force between like poles."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be 'Bulb lights up, Circuit is complete, Current starts flowing, Switch is turned on'. This is incorrect because the bulb cannot light up until the switch is turned on, which completes the circuit and allows the current to flow, reaching the bulb and making it light up."

This is because copper is the best conductor of electricity, allowing it to flow easily through it. Iron is also a good conductor, but not as good as copper. Rubber, on the other hand, is an insulator, which means it does not allow electricity to flow through it at all."
