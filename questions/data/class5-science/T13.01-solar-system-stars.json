    "text": "The Sun is the centre of our solar system and provides light and heat. Eight planets orbit the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars (inner/rocky), Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune (outer/gas giants). Earth rotates on its axis (causes day and night, 24 hours) and revolves around the Sun (causes year, 365.25 days). Earth's tilted axis causes seasons. The Moon is Earth's natural satellite, revolving around Earth in about 27 days, showing phases (new moon to full moon). Stars are distant suns appearing as points of light. Constellations are patterns of stars. Asteroids, comets, and meteors are other celestial bodies.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "India is in the Northern Hemisphere. In June, the Earth's tilted axis makes the Northern Hemisphere lean towards the Sun. This means the northern part of the Earth, including India, receives more direct sunlight, making it summer. It is not because India is closer to the Sun or because the Sun gets hotter.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Seasons are not caused by the Earth being closer to or farther from the Sun. The Sun does not change how hot it is during different months. The Moon does not affect the seasons. The real reason is that Earth's axis is tilted, and in June the Northern Hemisphere tilts towards the Sun, giving India more direct sunlight and longer days."

The Sun appears to rise in the east and set in the west because the Earth rotates on its axis, but the Sun stays at the centre of the solar system while the Earth revolves around it.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The Sun does not move around the Earth. This is a very old idea that people believed long ago, but it is incorrect. The Earth revolves around the Sun, completing one orbit in about 365 days. The rising and setting of the Sun is caused by the Earth's rotation on its own axis, not by the Sun moving."

      "explanation_correct": "The Moon does not produce its own light at all. It shines because it reflects the light from the Sun. When sunlight falls on the Moon's surface, it bounces back towards Earth, making the Moon look bright. This is why the Moon looks different during different phases, depending on how much of the sunlit side faces Earth.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The Moon does not have any source of light inside it and does not have glowing rocks. It also does not produce light only during full moon. The truth is that the Moon always reflects sunlight. We see different amounts of the lit side as the Moon orbits Earth, which creates the different phases like crescent, half moon, and full moon."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Seasons are caused by the tilt of Earth's axis, not by how close or far Earth is from the Sun. As Earth revolves around the Sun with its axis tilted at about 23.5 degrees, different parts of the Earth lean towards or away from the Sun at different times of the year. The hemisphere tilting towards the Sun gets more direct sunlight and experiences summer.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Earth does revolve around the Sun, and its distance from the Sun does change slightly during the year. However, this small change in distance is not what causes the seasons. The Moon also does not cause seasons. The real cause is the tilt of Earth's axis, which makes different hemispheres receive different amounts of direct sunlight as Earth orbits the Sun."

The side of the Earth facing the Sun has daytime, while the side facing away from the Sun has nighttime. One complete rotation takes about 24 hours, which is why we have one day and one night in every 24-hour period.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The Sun does not turn on and off. It shines all the time. The Moon does not block the Sun every night. That only happens during a solar eclipse, which is very rare. Earth's distance from the Sun does not cause day and night. The real reason is the Earth's rotation on its axis, which makes different parts face the Sun at different times."

But because they are millions and billions of kilometres away, they appear as tiny points of light. The farther away something is, the smaller it looks to us.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Stars are not small at all. Many stars are much larger than our Sun. The Moon does not hide starlight, and Earth's atmosphere does not make stars shrink. The real reason is that stars are incredibly far away from us. When objects are very far away, they look smaller.
