    "text": "The Sun is the centre of our solar system and provides light and heat. Eight planets orbit the Sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars (inner/rocky), Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune (outer/gas giants). Earth rotates on its axis (causes day and night, 24 hours) and revolves around the Sun (causes year, 365.25 days). Earth's tilted axis causes seasons. The Moon is Earth's natural satellite, revolving around Earth in about 27 days, showing phases (new moon to full moon). Stars are distant suns appearing as points of light. Constellations are patterns of stars. Asteroids, comets, and meteors are other celestial bodies.",
