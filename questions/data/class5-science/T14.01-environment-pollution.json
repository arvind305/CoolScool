    "text": "The environment includes living (biotic: plants, animals) and non-living (abiotic: air, water, soil, sunlight) components. Natural resources include air, water, soil, and minerals. Pollution is contamination of the environment. Air pollution comes from vehicles and factories, causing breathing problems and global warming. Water pollution comes from factory waste and sewage, making water unsafe. Land pollution comes from garbage and chemicals, damaging soil. The 3Rs (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) help protect the environment. Conservation includes planting trees, saving water and electricity, and using eco-friendly products.",
