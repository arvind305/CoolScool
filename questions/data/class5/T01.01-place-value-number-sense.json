      "explanation_incorrect": "The place value of 5 in the number 5,43,210 is not 5, 5,000, or 50,000. This is because the 5 is in the ten lakhs place, which has a value of 1,000,000. So the correct place value of 5 is 5,00,000."

In the lakhs place, the digit would have a place value of 600,000. And in the hundreds place, the digit would have a place value of 600. Since the place value of the digit is 60,000, it must be in the ten thousands place."
