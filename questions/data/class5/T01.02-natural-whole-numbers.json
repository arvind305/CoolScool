When you add an even and an odd number, the result cannot be evenly divisible by 2, making it an odd number. Option C is also incorrect because the sum is not sometimes even and sometimes odd - it is always odd. Option D is incorrect because the sum of an even and an odd number is not neither even nor odd, it is specifically an odd number."
