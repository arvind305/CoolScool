      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct Roman numeral equivalent of 900 is CM, not XC, CD, or XLIX. XC represents 90, CD represents 400, and XLIX represents 49, which are all different from 900. The key is to understand that when a smaller value appears before a larger value in Roman numerals, it is subtracted, so CM (1000 - 100) gives us 900."
