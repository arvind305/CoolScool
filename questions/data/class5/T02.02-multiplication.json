      "explanation_incorrect": "The standard method of multiplication involves breaking down the larger numbers into smaller parts and then multiplying each part. In this case, 456 × 78 has 3 partial products, not 2. We first multiply 456 by the ones digit of 78, which is 8. Then we multiply 456 by the tens digit of 78, which is 7. Finally, we multiply 456 by the hundreds digit of 78, which is also 7. The final answer is the sum of all three partial products."

The incorrect answer might be something like 45 pages, which is wrong because we need to multiply the number of pages printed per minute (35) by the number of minutes (45) to get the total number of pages printed. 35 pages per minute × 45 minutes = 1,575 pages."
