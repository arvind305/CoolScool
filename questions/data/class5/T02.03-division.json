      "explanation_correct": "The correct answer is 180 crates. We can find this by dividing the total number of mangoes (7,560) by the number of mangoes in each crate (42). This gives us the number of crates the farmer needs to sell all the mangoes.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be something like 179 crates. This is wrong because the total number of mangoes (7,560) cannot be perfectly divided by the number of mangoes in each crate (42). The correct answer is 180 crates, which is the number of crates needed to hold all 7,560 mangoes."
