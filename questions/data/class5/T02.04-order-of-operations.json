      "explanation_correct": "The correct answer is A) 100 marks. We need to follow the BODMAS rule to solve this expression. First, we do the multiplication 90 × 2 = 180. Then, we divide 180 by 4, which is 45. Finally, we add 80 and 45, then subtract 25 to get the total of 100 marks.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer is B) 125 marks. This is because the student did not follow the BODMAS rule. They likely did the addition 80 + 90 first, which is 170, then multiplied by 2 to get 340, divided by 4 to get 85, and then subtracted 25 to get 125. However, the correct order is to do the multiplication and division first, then the addition and subtraction."
