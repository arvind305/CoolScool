      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "The tank can hold 48 litres of water, and it is 5/6 full. To find how many more litres are needed to fill the tank, we need to find the amount of water the tank can hold when it is full, and then subtract the amount of water it currently holds. Since the tank is 5/6 full, it currently holds 5/6 of 48 litres, which is 40 litres. To find the amount of water needed to fill the tank, we subtract 40 litres from 48 litres, which is 8 litres.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because 6 litres is not the amount of water needed to fill the tank. Option C is incorrect because 10 litres is too much. Option D is incorrect because 12 litres is also too much. The correct answer is 8 litres, as the tank can hold 48 litres and it is currently 5/6 full, so it needs 8 more litres to be completely full."
