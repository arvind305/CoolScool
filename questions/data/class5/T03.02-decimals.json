This is because the decimal 0.008 has 3 places after the decimal point, which means it represents a fraction with a denominator of 1000. The number 8 in the tenths, hundredths, and thousandths places is the numerator, so the fraction is 8/1000.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A '8/10' is not correct because 0.008 does not have 1 place after the decimal point, it has 3 places. Option B '8/100' is also not correct because 0.008 does not have 2 places after the decimal point. Option D '80/1000' is not correct because the number in the hundredths and thousandths places is 8, not 80."
