      "explanation_incorrect": "The other options are incorrect because they do not correctly convert 8,065 m to km and m. Option B) 80 km 65 m is wrong because 8,065 m is less than 80,000 m. Option C) 8 km 650 m is wrong because 8,065 m is less than 8,650 m. Option D) 806 km 5 m is wrong because 8,065 m is less than 806,005 m."
