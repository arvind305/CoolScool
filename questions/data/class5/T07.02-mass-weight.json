Adding these two amounts used (1 kg 250 g + 2 kg 300 g = 3 kg 550 g), and subtracting from the total 5 kg, leaves 1 kg 450 g remaining.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The other options are incorrect because they do not correctly calculate the amount of vegetables left. Option B) 1 kg 550 g is too much, Option C) 2 kg 450 g is too much, and Option D) 1 kg 350 g is too little. The key is to start with the total amount bought, subtract the amounts used for lunch and dinner, and the remaining amount is 1 kg 450 g."
