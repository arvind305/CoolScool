      "explanation_correct": "The answer is 12:15 AM because 00:15 in 24-hour format is equivalent to 12:15 in the 12-hour format, with 'AM' indicating it is before noon.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A (12:15 PM) is incorrect because 00:15 in 24-hour format is before noon, so it should be in the AM time period. Option C (00:15 AM) is also incorrect because there is no such time as '00:15 AM' - the 24-hour format uses '00:00' to represent 12:00 AM. Option D (0:15 PM) is incorrect because the time should be written as '12:15 PM' in the 12-hour format."
