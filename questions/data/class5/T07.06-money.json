      "correct_answer": "1010",
      "explanation_correct": "The answer is 1010 paise because 10 rupees and 10 paise is the same as 1010 paise. One rupee is equal to 100 paise, so 10 rupees is 1000 paise, and 10 paise is an additional 10 paise, making the total 1010 paise.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to just write 10.10, which is the decimal form of the money. However, the question is asking for the amount in paise, which is the smaller unit of Indian currency. To convert 10 rupees and 10 paise to paise, we need to multiply the rupees by 100 (since 1 rupee = 100 paise) and add the 10 paise, which gives us a total of 1010 paise."
