      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is A) Pentagons/Hexagons. The pattern on a turtle's shell is not made up of stripes (option B), nor is it just hexagons (option C) or a six-fold symmetry (option D). The unique pattern of pentagons and hexagons is a special feature of the turtle's shell that helps protect its body."

Snowflakes have a unique six-fold symmetry, where the six identical arms or sides create a stunning, symmetrical pattern. This six-fold symmetry is the key characteristic of the snowflake pattern."
