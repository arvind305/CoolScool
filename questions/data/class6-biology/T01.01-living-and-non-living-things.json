    "text": "Living things are organisms that show characteristics of life such as movement, respiration, sensitivity, growth, reproduction, excretion, and nutrition (remembered by the acronym MRS GREN or MRS NERG). These life processes distinguish living things from non-living things. Non-living things can be natural (rocks, water, air) or man-made (books, cars, buildings). They do not grow, reproduce, or respond to stimuli. Once-living things are objects that were once part of living organisms but are no longer alive, such as wooden furniture, leather, paper, and dead leaves.",

        "Releasing energy from food (respiration)",

      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is 'Taking in sunlight and carbon dioxide', 'Making glucose (nutrition)', and 'Releasing energy from food (respiration)'. This is because plants use photosynthesis to make glucose from sunlight and carbon dioxide, and then they use respiration to release energy from the glucose.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order is 'Releasing energy from food (respiration)', 'Taking in sunlight and carbon dioxide', and 'Making glucose (nutrition)'. This is wrong because plants first need to take in sunlight and carbon dioxide to make glucose through photosynthesis. Then they can use respiration to release energy from the glucose they have made."
