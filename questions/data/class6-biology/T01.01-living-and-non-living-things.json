    "text": "Living things are organisms that show characteristics of life such as movement, respiration, sensitivity, growth, reproduction, excretion, and nutrition (remembered by the acronym MRS GREN or MRS NERG). These life processes distinguish living things from non-living things. Non-living things can be natural (rocks, water, air) or man-made (books, cars, buildings). They do not grow, reproduce, or respond to stimuli. Once-living things are objects that were once part of living organisms but are no longer alive, such as wooden furniture, leather, paper, and dead leaves.",
