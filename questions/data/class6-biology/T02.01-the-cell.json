    "text": "The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of all living organisms. Robert Hooke discovered cells in 1665 while observing cork under a microscope. The cell theory states that all living things are made of cells. A cell consists of three main parts: the cell membrane (controls entry and exit of substances), cytoplasm (jelly-like substance where chemical reactions occur), and nucleus (control center containing genetic material). Plant cells have additional structures like a cell wall (provides rigidity), large central vacuole (stores water and nutrients), and chloroplasts (contain chlorophyll for photosynthesis). Organisms can be unicellular (made of one cell like Amoeba) or multicellular (made of many cells like humans).",

Isaac Newton was a famous physicist, Charles Darwin was the scientist who proposed the theory of evolution, and Louis Pasteur was known for his work on pasteurization and germ theory. None of them discovered cells by observing cork under a microscope. Robert Hooke was the scientist who first observed and named cells after seeing them in cork samples."

At the center of the cell is the nucleus, which acts as the control center and contains the genetic material.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The order should be cell membrane, cytoplasm, and then nucleus. The cell membrane is the outermost layer that protects the cell and controls what goes in and out.
