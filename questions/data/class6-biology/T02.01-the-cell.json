    "text": "The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of all living organisms. Robert Hooke discovered cells in 1665 while observing cork under a microscope. The cell theory states that all living things are made of cells. A cell consists of three main parts: the cell membrane (controls entry and exit of substances), cytoplasm (jelly-like substance where chemical reactions occur), and nucleus (control center containing genetic material). Plant cells have additional structures like a cell wall (provides rigidity), large central vacuole (stores water and nutrients), and chloroplasts (contain chlorophyll for photosynthesis). Organisms can be unicellular (made of one cell like Amoeba) or multicellular (made of many cells like humans).",
