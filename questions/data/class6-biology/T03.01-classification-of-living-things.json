    "text": "Classification is the process of grouping living things based on their similarities and differences. This helps scientists study and identify organisms easily. The five kingdom classification system, proposed by R.H. Whittaker, divides all living things into five kingdoms: Monera (bacteria and blue-green algae - prokaryotes), Protista (single-celled eukaryotes like Amoeba), Fungi (non-green organisms like mushrooms that absorb food), Plantae (green plants that make their own food), and Animalia (animals that cannot make their own food and can move).",
    "rules": [
      "Classification groups organisms based on similarities",
      "The five kingdom system was proposed by R.H. Whittaker",
      "Monera includes prokaryotes (no true nucleus) like bacteria",
      "Protista includes unicellular eukaryotes like Amoeba",
      "Fungi cannot make their own food and absorb nutrients",
      "Plantae are autotrophs that make food by photosynthesis",
      "Animalia are heterotrophs that eat other organisms",

The purpose of classification is to organize and understand the diversity of life, not to alter the appearance or names of organisms. Counting all organisms is not the main reason for classification either, as scientists are more interested in understanding the relationships between different species."
