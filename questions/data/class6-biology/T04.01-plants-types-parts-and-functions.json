    "text": "Plants can be classified based on size (herbs, shrubs, trees) and lifespan (annuals, biennials, perennials). The main parts of a plant include roots, stem, leaves, flowers, fruits, and seeds. Roots anchor the plant and absorb water and minerals. There are two types: tap roots (one main root) and fibrous roots (many similar roots). The stem provides support, transports water and food, and may store nutrients. Leaves perform photosynthesis, transpiration, and gas exchange. The main parts of a leaf are the lamina, petiole, midrib, and veins. Flowers are the reproductive organs with sepals, petals, stamens (male), and pistil/carpel (female).",
    "rules": [
      "Herbs have soft stems, shrubs have hard stems branching near base, trees are tall with trunk",
      "Annuals complete life cycle in one year, biennials in two years, perennials live many years",
      "Tap roots have one main root, fibrous roots have many similar-sized roots",
      "Roots absorb water and minerals, anchor the plant, and may store food",
      "Stem supports the plant, transports water and food, and may store nutrients",
      "Leaves perform photosynthesis, transpiration, and gas exchange",
