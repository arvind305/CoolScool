    "text": "Animals are classified into two main groups: vertebrates (animals with a backbone) and invertebrates (animals without a backbone). Vertebrates include five classes: fish (gills, fins, scales), amphibians (moist skin, live on land and water), reptiles (dry scaly skin), birds (feathers, wings, lay eggs), and mammals (hair/fur, feed young with milk). Invertebrates include insects, spiders, worms, molluscs, and crustaceans. Adaptation refers to special features that help organisms survive in their environment. Different habitats require different adaptations: aquatic animals have fins and gills, terrestrial animals have legs and lungs, aerial animals have wings and hollow bones, desert animals conserve water, and polar animals have thick fur or blubber for warmth.",
    "rules": [
      "Vertebrates have a backbone, invertebrates do not",
      "Fish breathe through gills and live in water",
      "Amphibians can live both in water and on land",
      "Reptiles have dry, scaly skin and are cold-blooded",
      "Birds have feathers, wings, and most can fly",
      "Mammals have hair or fur and feed young with milk",
      "Adaptations are features that help survival in specific environments",
      "Cold-blooded animals cannot regulate body temperature internally",
      "Warm-blooded animals maintain constant body temperature"
