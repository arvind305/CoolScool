    "text": "The human body is organized in a hierarchy: cells form tissues, tissues form organs, organs form organ systems, and organ systems together make up the organism. The skeletal system provides support, protection, and enables movement. It consists of bones connected by joints (fixed, slightly movable, and freely movable). The muscular system enables movement and consists of voluntary (skeletal), involuntary (smooth), and cardiac muscles. The digestive system breaks down food and absorbs nutrients, including the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and intestines. The respiratory system takes in oxygen and removes carbon dioxide, using the nose, trachea, and lungs. The circulatory system transports blood throughout the body using the heart, blood vessels, and blood.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Some people may think that all joints in the body allow free movement, but that is not correct. The human body has different types of joints, and not all of them allow for free movement. For example, the joints in the skull are fixed and do not move, while the joints in the shoulder and knee are freely movable and allow for a wide range of movement."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Some students might think we can consciously control our cardiac muscles because we can control other muscles in our body, like the ones that move our arms and legs. However, cardiac muscles are different - they work on their own to pump blood through our body. We don't have to think about making our heart beat."
