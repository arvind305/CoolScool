    "text": "The human body is organized in a hierarchy: cells form tissues, tissues form organs, organs form organ systems, and organ systems together make up the organism. The skeletal system provides support, protection, and enables movement. It consists of bones connected by joints (fixed, slightly movable, and freely movable). The muscular system enables movement and consists of voluntary (skeletal), involuntary (smooth), and cardiac muscles. The digestive system breaks down food and absorbs nutrients, including the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and intestines. The respiratory system takes in oxygen and removes carbon dioxide, using the nose, trachea, and lungs. The circulatory system transports blood throughout the body using the heart, blood vessels, and blood.",

Even though students are aware of their heartbeat and may feel it speed up when they are scared or exercising, they cannot consciously decide to start or stop it. Walking, picking up a pencil, and waving are all voluntary actions controlled by skeletal muscles that we consciously choose to move.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Walking across the room (A), picking up a pencil (B), and waving your hand (D) are all voluntary actions — we consciously decide to do them using our skeletal muscles. The heart beating (C) is the involuntary action here. Although we can feel our heart beating, we cannot control it with our will. Cardiac muscles work automatically throughout our life."

Bones have a blood supply and continue to grow and change throughout childhood and adolescence.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is a common misconception — bones are not like stones. They are living tissues with cells. Option C is wrong because bones continue to grow as a child grows up. Option D is incorrect because bones do have a blood supply, which provides nutrients to the bone cells and carries away waste. The correct answer is B: bones are living, growing, and self-repairing tissues."

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation_correct": "The small intestine is the main organ for nutrient absorption because it is very long (about 6 metres in adults) and its inner walls are covered with tiny finger-like projections called villi. These villi increase the surface area enormously, allowing nutrients to be absorbed into the blood efficiently. The stomach, by contrast, mainly breaks food down and has a much smaller absorptive surface.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option B is wrong because the stomach's temperature is not the reason — the issue is surface area. Option C is incorrect because partially digested food with nutrients passes through the stomach too, but the stomach's main job is breaking food down, not absorbing nutrients. Option D is wrong because proximity to the heart does not determine absorption. The correct answer is A: the small intestine's large surface area with villi makes it ideal for absorption."

At the same time, waste products like carbon dioxide must be carried away from the cells. If the heart stopped pumping, cells would not receive oxygen, and waste would build up — this would quickly harm the body.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because keeping blood warm is not the primary reason the heart must pump continuously. Option C is incorrect because blood does not become solid simply from stopping. Option D is wrong because the heart does not beat just for exercise. The real reason (B) is that the body's cells constantly require oxygen and nutrients and need waste removed — all delivered and carried away by continuously circulating blood."

Each organ contributes a specific part of the overall task, and only through coordination can the entire function be completed efficiently.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because size is not the reason organs form systems. Option C is partly misleading — organs do have individual functions, but complex tasks require coordination among several organs. Option D is incorrect because organ systems exist for function, not appearance. The correct answer is B: complex body functions require the coordinated effort of multiple organs working together as a system."
