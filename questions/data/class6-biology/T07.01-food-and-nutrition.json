    "text": "Food contains six main components: carbohydrates (for energy), proteins (for growth and repair), fats (for energy storage and insulation), vitamins (for various body functions), minerals (for strong bones, blood, and other functions), and water (for all body processes). Roughage (fiber) is also important for digestion. Vitamins include A (eyes), B (energy), C (healing), and D (bones). Important minerals include calcium (bones), iron (blood), and iodine (thyroid). A balanced diet contains all nutrients in proper amounts. Deficiency diseases occur when specific nutrients are lacking: night blindness (Vitamin A), beriberi (Vitamin B1), scurvy (Vitamin C), rickets (Vitamin D), anemia (iron), and goiter (iodine).",
