    "text": "Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not just the absence of disease. Hygiene refers to practices that maintain health and prevent diseases. Personal hygiene includes bathing, dental care, hand washing, and nail care. Diseases can be communicable (spread from person to person) or non-communicable (cannot spread). Communicable diseases spread through air (cold, flu), water (cholera, typhoid), food, direct contact, or vectors like mosquitoes (malaria). Prevention includes cleanliness, safe drinking water, proper food handling, and vaccination. Community hygiene involves proper sanitation, waste disposal, and clean water supply.",
