    "text": "A habitat is the natural home of an organism where it finds food, shelter, and conditions for survival. Habitats can be terrestrial (forests, deserts, grasslands) or aquatic (freshwater, marine). An ecosystem is a community of living things (biotic components) interacting with their non-living environment (abiotic components). Biotic components include producers (plants), consumers (herbivores, carnivores, omnivores), and decomposers (fungi, bacteria). Abiotic components include air, water, soil, sunlight, and temperature. A food chain shows the transfer of energy from one organism to another, while a food web shows interconnected food chains. Organisms in an ecosystem are interdependent. Threats to habitats include deforestation, pollution, and climate change, making conservation essential.",

A habitat is the specific natural environment where an organism lives and finds everything it needs to survive.

It is the natural environment that an organism is adapted to and where it can find everything it needs to survive, like food, water, and shelter. If the statement was false, it would mean that a habitat could be any random place, which is not correct."

If one food chain is disrupted, the other food chains can still provide food and energy to the ecosystem. This makes the entire ecosystem more resilient and less likely to be affected by changes in the environment.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "A single food chain is less stable than a food web because it has only one path for energy and nutrients to flow through the ecosystem. If something happens to disrupt that single food chain, the whole ecosystem can collapse. But a food web has many pathways for energy and nutrients, so if one food chain is affected, the other food chains can keep the ecosystem stable and healthy."

These nutrients then get released back into the soil, making it rich in the minerals that plants need to grow. This is why decomposers are important for recycling nutrients in an ecosystem.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Some students may think that decomposers do not return nutrients to the soil, but this is not correct. Decomposers play a crucial role in an ecosystem by breaking down dead organic matter and returning the nutrients to the soil.
