    "text": "A habitat is the natural home of an organism where it finds food, shelter, and conditions for survival. Habitats can be terrestrial (forests, deserts, grasslands) or aquatic (freshwater, marine). An ecosystem is a community of living things (biotic components) interacting with their non-living environment (abiotic components). Biotic components include producers (plants), consumers (herbivores, carnivores, omnivores), and decomposers (fungi, bacteria). Abiotic components include air, water, soil, sunlight, and temperature. A food chain shows the transfer of energy from one organism to another, while a food web shows interconnected food chains. Organisms in an ecosystem are interdependent. Threats to habitats include deforestation, pollution, and climate change, making conservation essential.",
