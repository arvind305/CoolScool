Matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms and molecules that are too small to be seen with the naked eye. These particles have spaces between them, are always in motion, and attract each other. Matter can be classified based on physical properties into solids, liquids, and gases, or based on origin into natural and man-made substances.",

      "explanation_correct": "Diffusion in solids has the slowest rate, as the particles in solids are tightly packed and have the least amount of space to move around. Diffusion in liquids is faster than solids, as the particles in liquids have more space to move around. Diffusion in gases is the fastest, as the particles in gases have the most space to move around freely.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The order of increasing rate of diffusion is not 'Diffusion in solid, Diffusion in liquid, Diffusion in gas'. The correct order is 'Diffusion in solid, Diffusion in liquid, Diffusion in gas'. This is because the particles in gases have the most space to move around, so gases have the fastest rate of diffusion, followed by liquids and then solids."

      "explanation_correct": "The particles in ice have the least amount of motion, as ice is a solid state with particles tightly packed together. The particles in water have more motion, as water is a liquid state with particles able to move more freely. The particles in steam have the most motion, as steam is a gas state with particles moving around very quickly.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to arrange the particles from most motion to least motion. This is because the particles in steam (gas) have the most motion, the particles in water (liquid) have less motion, and the particles in ice (solid) have the least amount of motion. The correct order is from least motion to most motion: particles in ice, particles in water, particles in steam."

Atoms are the smallest building blocks of matter, and multiple atoms bond together to form molecules. A visible grain of sand is much larger than a single atom or molecule and can be seen with the naked eye.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The order should be atom, molecule, and then visible grain of sand. This is because atoms are the smallest particles of matter, and multiple atoms bond together to form molecules. A visible grain of sand is much larger than a single atom or molecule and can be seen with the naked eye. Arranging them in the order of molecule, atom, and then visible grain of sand would be incorrect because it does not match the size of these particles."
