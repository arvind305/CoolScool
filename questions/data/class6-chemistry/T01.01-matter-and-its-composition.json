    "text": "Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. Everything around us is made up of matter, including air, water, soil, and all living things. Matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms and molecules that are too small to be seen with the naked eye. These particles have spaces between them, are always in motion, and attract each other. Matter can be classified based on physical properties into solids, liquids, and gases, or based on origin into natural and man-made substances.",
