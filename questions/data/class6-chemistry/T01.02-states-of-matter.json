    "text": "Matter exists in three main states: solid, liquid, and gas. In solids, particles are tightly packed and vibrate in fixed positions, giving solids a definite shape and volume. In liquids, particles are less tightly packed and can slide past each other, so liquids have a definite volume but take the shape of their container. In gases, particles are far apart and move freely, so gases have neither definite shape nor definite volume. Matter can change from one state to another by gaining or losing heat energy. These changes include melting, freezing, evaporation, boiling, condensation, and sublimation.",

This is because warming a solid requires the least energy, then melting a solid to a liquid requires more energy, and boiling a liquid to a gas requires the most energy.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be 'Boiling (liquid to gas)', 'Melting (solid to liquid)', and 'Warming a solid'. This is wrong because boiling a liquid to a gas requires the most energy, then melting a solid to a liquid requires less energy, and warming a solid requires the least energy."
