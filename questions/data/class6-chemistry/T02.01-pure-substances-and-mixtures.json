    "text": "Matter can be classified into pure substances and mixtures. Pure substances have a fixed composition and definite properties. They include elements (like gold, oxygen) and compounds (like water, salt). Mixtures are formed by combining two or more substances physically. The components of a mixture retain their individual properties and can be separated by physical methods. Mixtures can be homogeneous (uniform composition, like salt solution) or heterogeneous (non-uniform composition, like sand and water).",
