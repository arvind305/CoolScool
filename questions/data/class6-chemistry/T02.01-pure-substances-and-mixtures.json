    "text": "Matter can be classified into pure substances and mixtures. Pure substances have a fixed composition and definite properties. They include elements (like gold, oxygen) and compounds (like water, salt). Mixtures are formed by combining two or more substances physically. The components of a mixture retain their individual properties and can be separated by physical methods. Mixtures can be homogeneous (uniform composition, like salt solution) or heterogeneous (non-uniform composition, like sand and water).",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Option B is correct because a pure substance has a fixed composition. This means it is made up of the same substances in the same amounts everywhere, unlike a mixture which can have variable amounts of its components. Pure substances cannot be easily separated into different substances using simple physical methods."
