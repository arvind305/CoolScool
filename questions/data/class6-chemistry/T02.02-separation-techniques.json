      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is to first mix the mud and water, then let the mixture stand so the mud settles down (sedimentation), and finally pour off the clear water on top (decantation). This allows the mud to separate from the water using these physical properties.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to first pour off the clear water, then let the mixture stand. This won't work because the mud is still mixed with the water, so pouring off the water first wouldn't separate the two. You need to let the mud settle first before pouring off the water on top."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: 1. Collect the salt left behind, 2. Prepare salt solution, 3. Heat the solution to evaporate water. This is wrong because you cannot collect the salt before you have actually made the salt solution and then evaporated the water from it. The correct steps are to first make the salt solution, then heat it to remove the water, and finally collect the salt that is left behind."
