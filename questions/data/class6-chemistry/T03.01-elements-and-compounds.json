    "text": "Elements are the simplest form of matter that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by ordinary chemical means. They are made up of only one type of atom. Elements are classified as metals (like iron, copper, gold) and non-metals (like oxygen, nitrogen, carbon). Compounds are formed when two or more elements combine chemically in a fixed ratio. Compounds have properties different from their constituent elements. For example, water is a compound made of hydrogen and oxygen, but its properties are different from both elements.",
