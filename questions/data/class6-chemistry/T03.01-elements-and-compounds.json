    "text": "Elements are the simplest form of matter that cannot be broken down into simpler substances by ordinary chemical means. They are made up of only one type of atom. Elements are classified as metals (like iron, copper, gold) and non-metals (like oxygen, nitrogen, carbon). Compounds are formed when two or more elements combine chemically in a fixed ratio. Compounds have properties different from their constituent elements. For example, water is a compound made of hydrogen and oxygen, but its properties are different from both elements.",

Gold is a single element made of only one type of atom, while water is a compound made of two types of atoms (hydrogen and oxygen). Air is a mixture of several gases, so it contains the most atom types.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to put Air first, as it is a mixture of different gases and therefore has the most atom types. Water would come next with two atom types (hydrogen and oxygen), and Gold would come last with only one type of atom."

An element is the most difficult to separate because it is made up of only one type of atom.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Element, Compound, Mixture. This is not correct because an element is the simplest form of matter and cannot be broken down further, so it is the most difficult to separate. A compound can be broken down into its elements, which is more difficult than separating a mixture where the substances are not chemically bonded."
