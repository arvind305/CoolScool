    "text": "Changes in matter are of two types: physical changes and chemical changes. In physical changes, no new substance is formed. Only the physical properties like shape, size, or state may change. Physical changes are usually reversible. Examples include melting ice, dissolving sugar, and tearing paper. In chemical changes, new substances with different properties are formed. Chemical changes are usually irreversible. They are often accompanied by changes in color, temperature, release of gas, or change in smell. Examples include burning, rusting, and cooking.",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is: Take ice from freezer, Leave ice at room temperature, Ice melts to form water. This is the sequence of steps that shows a physical change. First, you need to take the ice out of the freezer. Then, you leave the ice at room temperature. This causes the ice to melt and turn into liquid water, which is a physical change where the state of matter changes but the substance remains the same.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Ice melts to form water, Take ice from freezer, Leave ice at room temperature. This is not the correct sequence because you need to first take the ice out of the freezer, then leave it at room temperature, and only then will the ice melt to form water. The steps are out of order in this incorrect explanation."

This is the sequence of steps that occurs during the chemical change of rusting. The iron first comes into contact with air and water, then it reacts with the oxygen and moisture, and finally the rust (iron oxide) is formed on the surface.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Rust (iron oxide) forms on the surface, Iron is exposed to air and water, Iron reacts with oxygen and moisture. This is incorrect because the rusting process starts with the iron being exposed to air and water, then it reacts with the oxygen and moisture, and finally the rust (iron oxide) forms on the surface. The steps must occur in the correct order for the chemical change of rusting to happen."

The next most common sign is the evolution of a gas, like when baking soda and vinegar are mixed and produce bubbles of carbon dioxide gas. The least common sign is the production of light, which only happens in some chemical reactions like burning.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct order from most common to least common sign of a chemical change is: change in color, evolution of gas, production of light. This is because changes in color are very common in chemical reactions, like when food is cooked. Releasing gas is also quite common, like when baking soda and vinegar are mixed. But the production of light is less common and only happens in some special chemical reactions."

Burning is a chemical change that creates many new substances and is very difficult to reverse, making it the most irreversible of the three.",

Burning is a chemical change that creates many new substances and is very difficult to reverse, making it the most irreversible of the three."
