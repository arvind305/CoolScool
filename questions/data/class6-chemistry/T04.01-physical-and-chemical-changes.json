    "text": "Changes in matter are of two types: physical changes and chemical changes. In physical changes, no new substance is formed. Only the physical properties like shape, size, or state may change. Physical changes are usually reversible. Examples include melting ice, dissolving sugar, and tearing paper. In chemical changes, new substances with different properties are formed. Chemical changes are usually irreversible. They are often accompanied by changes in color, temperature, release of gas, or change in smell. Examples include burning, rusting, and cooking.",
