    "text": "Air is a mixture of different gases that surrounds the Earth. The main components of air are nitrogen (about 78%), oxygen (about 21%), carbon dioxide (about 0.03%), and other gases like noble gases (about 0.97%). Air also contains water vapor and dust particles. Oxygen is essential for respiration and burning. Nitrogen is used by plants and in making fertilizers. Carbon dioxide is used by plants for photosynthesis. Air pollution occurs when harmful substances like smoke, dust, and poisonous gases mix with air.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Air is not a pure substance, compound, or element. A pure substance is made of only one type of molecule, like water (H2O). A compound is made of two or more elements chemically joined, like carbon dioxide (CO2). An element is a basic substance that cannot be broken down, like oxygen (O2). Air is a mixture of many different gases, so it is not any of these - it is a mixture of gases."

      "explanation_correct": "Nitrogen is an inert gas, meaning it does not easily react with other substances. Chip packets are filled with nitrogen because it does not react with the chips or allow them to go stale, and it prevents oxygen from reaching the food, which would cause it to spoil.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Oxygen would make the chips stale faster because it reacts with fats in the chips. Carbon dioxide could dissolve in any moisture and form an acid. Water vapor would make chips soggy. Nitrogen is the best choice because it is inert and does not react with food, keeping chips fresh and crispy for a long time."

      "explanation_incorrect": "There is still air at high altitudes, but it is much thinner (option A is wrong). Oxygen cylinders do not provide warmth (option C is wrong). The percentage of nitrogen does not increase at high altitudes — the overall air pressure decreases, making all gases, including oxygen, less available (option D is wrong).
