    "text": "Water is essential for all living things and makes up about 70% of the human body. It is found in various sources like rain, rivers, lakes, and underground. Water is colorless, odorless, and tasteless. It exists in three states: solid (ice), liquid (water), and gas (water vapor or steam). Water boils at 100 degrees Celsius and freezes at 0 degrees Celsius. The water cycle involves evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. Water is called the universal solvent because it dissolves many substances. Water pollution is a serious problem caused by industrial waste, sewage, and chemicals. Water conservation is important to ensure availability for future generations.",

This is because rainwater is pure water that falls from the sky, while river water has some dissolved minerals, and seawater has a high concentration of dissolved salts and minerals.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Seawater is the saltiest water source, followed by river water, and then rainwater. This is incorrect because rainwater is the purest and freshest water source, since it does not have any dissolved minerals or salts. River water has some dissolved minerals, making it less pure than rainwater, but still fresher than seawater which has a high concentration of dissolved salts."

      "explanation_correct": "The order from simplest to most complex water conservation method is fixing leaky taps, rainwater harvesting, and building check dams. Fixing leaky taps is the simplest as it just requires repairing a tap. Rainwater harvesting is more complex as it involves setting up a system to collect and store rainwater. Building check dams is the most complex as it requires constructing a dam to slow down water flow and increase groundwater levels.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be building check dams, fixing leaky taps, rainwater harvesting. Building check dams is the most complex method as it requires significant construction work. Fixing leaky taps is simpler than building a rainwater harvesting system, which involves setting up tanks and pipes to collect and store rainwater. The correct order from simplest to most complex is fixing leaky taps, rainwater harvesting, and then building check dams."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is: rain falls on land, water collects in streams and rivers, and then the rivers flow to the oceans. This is because rainwater first falls on the land, then it gathers in smaller streams and rivers, and eventually these rivers carry the water back to the oceans.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: rivers flow to oceans, rain falls on land, water collects in streams and rivers. This is wrong because the water cycle starts with rain falling on the land, which then collects in streams and rivers, and finally these rivers flow back to the oceans. The order of the steps is important to understand how water returns to the oceans after rainfall."
