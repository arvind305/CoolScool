The International System of Units (SI) is the globally accepted system. The SI unit of length is meter (m), of mass is kilogram (kg), and of time is second (s). We use rulers and measuring tapes to measure length, balances to measure mass, and clocks or stopwatches to measure time. Accurate measurement requires proper technique and reading scales correctly.",
