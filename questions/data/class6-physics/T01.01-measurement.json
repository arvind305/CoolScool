The International System of Units (SI) is the globally accepted system. The SI unit of length is meter (m), of mass is kilogram (kg), and of time is second (s). We use rulers and measuring tapes to measure length, balances to measure mass, and clocks or stopwatches to measure time. Accurate measurement requires proper technique and reading scales correctly.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect arrangement would be to put the units in the order: meter, centimeter, kilometer, millimeter. This is wrong because the meter is larger than the centimeter, and the kilometer is larger than the meter. The order from smallest to largest should be millimeter, centimeter, meter, and then kilometer."
