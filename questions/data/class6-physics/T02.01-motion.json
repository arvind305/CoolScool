    "text": "Motion is the change in position of an object with respect to time and a reference point. An object is at rest when its position does not change. There are different types of motion: linear motion (straight line), circular motion (in a circle), rotational motion (spinning), oscillatory motion (to and fro), and random motion (irregular). Speed tells us how fast an object is moving and is calculated by dividing distance by time. The SI unit of speed is meters per second (m/s).",
    "rules": [
      "Motion is change in position with respect to time.",
      "Rest means no change in position.",
      "Linear motion is movement in a straight line.",

As the drill bit goes into the hole, it moves in a straight line, which is the linear motion. At the same time, it also spins or rotates around its own axis, which is the rotational motion. So the correct answer is that the drill bit has both linear and rotational motion."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The order is not correct. The objects should be arranged from slowest to fastest speed, which is: walking person (5 km/h), running person (10 km/h), cycling (15 km/h), and car (60 km/h). The car has the highest speed, so it should be listed last, not first."

This is because 10 m/s is the smallest number, 50 km/h is faster than 10 m/s, 20 m/s is faster than 50 km/h, and 100 km/h is the fastest of all.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The speeds are not arranged correctly. To arrange them from slowest to fastest, we need to convert the speeds to the same units first. 50 km/h is equal to 13.89 m/s, and 100 km/h is equal to 27.78 m/s. So the correct order from slowest to fastest is: 10 m/s, 13.89 m/s (50 km/h), 20 m/s, 27.78 m/s (100 km/h)."
