    "text": "Force is a push or pull that can change the state of motion or shape of an object. Forces can make objects start moving, stop, speed up, slow down, or change direction. Forces can also change the shape of objects. There are different types of forces including muscular force (exerted by muscles), frictional force (opposes motion), gravitational force (pulls objects toward Earth), and magnetic force. Forces can be classified as contact forces (require physical touch) or non-contact forces (act at a distance).",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order shows what happens when an archer shoots an arrow. First, the archer pulls back the string using muscular force. Then, the string is released, which causes the arrow to fly forward. Finally, the bow returns to its original shape after the arrow has been shot.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order does not accurately represent the sequence of events when an archer shoots an arrow. The arrow cannot fly forward until the string has been released, and the bow cannot return to its original shape until after the arrow has been shot. The correct order is: String is pulled back (muscular force), String is released, Bow returns to original shape, Arrow flies forward."

This is the correct sequence because the driver's action of pressing the brake pedal initiates the process that leads to the car slowing down.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Brake pads press against wheels, Friction stops the wheels, Car slows down, Driver presses brake pedal. This is wrong because the driver pressing the brake pedal is the first step that starts the process, not the last step.

This is not correct because the first effect of a force is to start the motion of an object, not to change its shape.

The force first makes the object start moving, then it can change the direction of the moving object, then it can stop the motion, and finally it can change the shape or size of the object."
