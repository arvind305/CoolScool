    "text": "Light is a form of energy that enables us to see objects. Objects that produce their own light are called luminous objects (like the Sun and bulbs), while objects that do not produce light are non-luminous objects. Light travels in straight lines. Based on how much light passes through, materials are classified as transparent (allows all light), translucent (allows some light), or opaque (blocks all light). Shadows are formed when light is blocked by opaque objects. Reflection is the bouncing back of light from a surface. Plane mirrors form images that are the same size, laterally inverted, and appear to be at the same distance behind the mirror.",

      "explanation_correct": "The shadow length is shortest at noon because the Sun is directly overhead, and the object casts a very short shadow. As the day progresses, the Sun's position changes, and the shadow length increases, being longest in the early morning and late evening when the Sun is closer to the horizon.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The order of shadow lengths from shortest to longest during the day is not random. The shadow is shortest at noon when the Sun is directly overhead, and gets longer as the Sun moves lower in the sky in the morning and evening. So the correct order is: shadow at noon, shadow at 10 AM, shadow in early morning, shadow in late evening."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: 1) Eyes receive the light, 2) Light falls on the object, 3) Light reflects from the object, 4) Light source emits light. This is wrong because the light source must emit the light first, which then falls on the object, reflects off it, and finally reaches our eyes.
