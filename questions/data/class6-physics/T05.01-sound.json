    "text": "Sound is a form of energy produced by vibrating objects. When an object vibrates, it creates disturbances in the surrounding medium that travel as sound waves. Sound requires a medium (solid, liquid, or gas) to travel and cannot travel through vacuum. Sound travels fastest in solids, slower in liquids, and slowest in gases. Loudness of sound depends on the amplitude of vibration - larger vibrations produce louder sounds. Pitch of sound depends on the frequency of vibration - faster vibrations produce higher pitch sounds.",

The key difference is in amplitude, which determines loudness.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The difference between a whisper and a shout is not about frequency or speed. Frequency determines pitch (how high or low the sound is), not loudness. A whisper and a shout can have similar pitch. Also, both travel at the same speed through air because the speed of sound depends on the medium, not the loudness.

This is why we can see light from the Sun through space, but sound cannot travel through the vacuum of space.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "Arjun can conclude that sound needs air or a medium to travel. As the air was pumped out, there were fewer and fewer particles for the sound to travel through, making it softer. When all the air was removed, creating a vacuum, the sound could not travel at all. The alarm was still ringing (its hammer was visibly moving), but without a medium, the sound could not reach outside the jar.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The glass jar did not absorb the sound waves because the sound was heard clearly before the air was pumped out. The alarm clock did not stop working because it was visibly still ringing inside the jar. The sound was not too weak to pass through glass because it was heard clearly at the beginning. The real reason is that without air or any medium inside the jar, sound waves cannot travel from the alarm to the glass walls and then to our ears."

This increases the amplitude (size) of the vibration, which makes the sound louder without changing the pitch. The note stays the same because the frequency of vibration does not change when you pluck harder. Loudness depends on amplitude, not frequency.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Plucking faster, tightening the string, or using a thinner string would change the frequency and therefore change the pitch of the note. The teacher asked for the same note to be played louder, not a different note. To increase loudness while keeping the same note, Rohan needs to increase the amplitude of vibration by plucking with more force, not change the frequency."

Plucking harder only increases the amplitude (size) of vibration, which makes the sound louder, not higher in pitch. Pitch depends on frequency, which is affected by the thickness, tightness, and length of the string. Many students mistakenly think that plucking harder changes the pitch, but it only changes the loudness.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Changing the thickness, tightness, or length of a string all affect how fast the string vibrates (its frequency), which changes the pitch. A thinner, tighter, or shorter string vibrates faster and produces a higher pitch.

Outer space, a vacuum chamber, and an empty sealed bottle with no air are all examples of vacuums where sound cannot travel because there are no particles.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Outer space is a vacuum with almost no particles, so sound cannot travel through it. A vacuum chamber has had its air removed, so it also cannot transmit sound. An empty sealed bottle with no air is also a vacuum. Water, however, is a liquid with particles closely spaced together, and sound can travel through it very well.

This is a trick question because all the other options involve objects that are clearly vibrating.",

The bell's body vibrates, the sitar string vibrates back and forth, and the drum membrane vibrates when struck. A book lying still on a table has no vibrations at all, so it cannot produce any sound.

Sound waves work by making particles in a medium vibrate back and forth, passing the vibration from one particle to the next. Empty space (vacuum) has no particles at all, so there is nothing to vibrate and pass the sound along. This is fundamentally different from light, which does not need particles to travel.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The reason is not about speed. Sound is not too slow to travel through space; it simply cannot travel there at all without particles. Sound is indeed a form of energy, so option C is wrong. Sound waves are not blocked by a boundary between air and space. The fundamental reason is that sound must have particles to vibrate in order to move, and a vacuum has no particles."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Sound travels faster in iron than in water because the particles in iron are more tightly packed and have stronger bonds between them. When one particle in iron vibrates, it quickly passes that vibration to the next particle due to the strong bonds. In water, the particles are further apart and the bonds are weaker, so it takes slightly longer for vibrations to transfer. The key factor is how closely packed and strongly bonded the particles are.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Being heavier does not automatically mean sound travels faster. The key factor is how tightly packed and strongly bonded the particles are. Not all properties of metals make them better at everything. Water does not absorb sound energy significantly. The correct reason is specifically about the arrangement and bonding of particles in solids versus liquids."

Pitch depends on frequency, and the mosquito's rapid wing beats produce high-frequency vibrations. The sound is not classified as loud because the amplitude of the vibrations is small. Loudness and pitch are independent properties: a sound can be high-pitched but soft, which is exactly what a mosquito's buzz is.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The size of the wings or the distance from the ear does not determine whether a sound is classified as high-pitched. Not all tiny things make high-pitched sounds. The classification depends on the physical property of the vibration. High pitch means high frequency of vibration, and the mosquito's wings vibrate at a very high frequency. Loudness would require large amplitude, which the tiny mosquito wings do not produce."
