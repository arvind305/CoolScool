    "text": "Sound is a form of energy produced by vibrating objects. When an object vibrates, it creates disturbances in the surrounding medium that travel as sound waves. Sound requires a medium (solid, liquid, or gas) to travel and cannot travel through vacuum. Sound travels fastest in solids, slower in liquids, and slowest in gases. Loudness of sound depends on the amplitude of vibration - larger vibrations produce louder sounds. Pitch of sound depends on the frequency of vibration - faster vibrations produce higher pitch sounds.",

      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The sounds are arranged from softest to loudest because a whisper is the quietest, followed by a normal conversation, then shouting, and finally an airplane taking off which is the loudest. The loudness of a sound depends on the amplitude or size of the vibrations that create the sound waves.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The sounds are not arranged correctly from softest to loudest. A whisper is indeed the softest sound, but a normal conversation is louder than a whisper, and shouting is louder than a normal conversation. An airplane taking off is the loudest sound in the list. The correct order from softest to loudest is: Whisper, Normal conversation, Shouting, Airplane taking off."

      ],
      "explanation_correct": "Sound travels fastest through steel, then wood, then water, and slowest through air. This is because sound waves can move more easily through denser materials like metals and liquids compared to less dense materials like air.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Sound does not travel equally fast through all materials. The speed of sound depends on the properties of the material it is traveling through. Air is the least dense of the given materials, so sound travels slowest through air. Water is denser than air, so sound travels faster through water. Wood and steel are even denser, so sound travels fastest through these solid materials."
