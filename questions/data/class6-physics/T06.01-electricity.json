    "text": "Electricity is a form of energy that powers many devices we use daily. An electric circuit is a closed path through which electricity flows. A simple circuit consists of a cell (source of electricity), connecting wires, a bulb (load), and a switch. When the circuit is closed (complete), electricity flows and the bulb lights up. When the circuit is open (broken), electricity cannot flow. Materials that allow electricity to pass through are called conductors (like metals). Materials that do not allow electricity to pass through are called insulators (like rubber, plastic, wood).",

      "explanation_correct": "Copper is the best conductor, allowing electricity to flow very easily. Iron is also a good conductor, but not as good as copper. Plastic and rubber are insulators, so they do not allow electricity to flow through them easily. This is why the correct order from best conductor to best insulator is: Copper, Iron, Plastic, Rubber.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Plastic, Rubber, Iron, Copper. This is wrong because plastic and rubber are insulators, which means they do not allow electricity to flow through them easily. Iron is a better conductor than plastic and rubber, and copper is the best conductor of the four materials listed."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to first observe if the bulb lights up, then place the object in the gap, and then conclude if the object is a conductor or insulator. This is not the right sequence because you need to first set up the circuit with a gap before you can test the object. Observing the bulb first without setting up the circuit properly will not give you the information you need to determine if the object is a conductor or insulator."

This is wrong because the electricity needs to flow from the cell (source) to the bulb (load) and then back to the cell to complete the circuit. The bulb cannot be placed before the cell, as it needs the electricity from the cell to light up."
