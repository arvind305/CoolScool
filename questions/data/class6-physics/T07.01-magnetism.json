    "text": "A magnet is an object that attracts materials like iron, nickel, and cobalt. Magnets have two poles - north pole and south pole - where the magnetic force is strongest. Like poles (north-north or south-south) repel each other, while unlike poles (north-south) attract each other. Materials attracted by magnets are called magnetic materials (iron, cobalt, nickel, steel). Materials not attracted by magnets are called non-magnetic materials (wood, plastic, copper, aluminum). Magnets are used in many everyday devices like compasses, refrigerator doors, and speakers.",

The magnet can then be moved through the mixture to attract and collect the iron filings, which are the magnetic material.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order is not correct because the iron filings cannot be separated from the sand until they have been mixed together first. The magnet needs to be moved through the mixture in order to attract the iron filings, which can then be collected by removing them from the magnet."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is: Magnets are brought close together, Like poles face each other, Repelling force is felt, Magnets push away from each other. This is because when you bring two magnets with their like poles (north-north or south-south) together, they will feel a repelling force that will make them push away from each other.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Like poles face each other, Magnets are brought close together, Magnets push away from each other, Repelling force is felt. This is wrong because the magnets need to be brought close together first before the like poles face each other, and then the repelling force will be felt, causing the magnets to push away from each other."
