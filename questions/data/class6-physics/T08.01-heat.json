    "text": "Heat is a form of energy that flows from a hotter object to a colder object. Temperature is the measure of how hot or cold an object is. Heat and temperature are related but different - heat is energy while temperature is a measurement. A thermometer is used to measure temperature. Heat is transferred in three ways: conduction (through solids by particle vibration), convection (through fluids by particle movement), and radiation (through empty space without any medium). Materials that allow heat to pass through easily are called conductors of heat (metals). Materials that do not allow heat to pass through easily are called insulators (wood, plastic, air).",

Force is a push or pull, and pressure is the force applied over an area. Heat is a type of energy that can move from one place to another, causing things to become warmer or cooler."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Meera is correct. Newspaper is a poor conductor of heat (insulator). By wrapping the ice cream in newspaper, she creates a barrier that slows down the transfer of heat from the warm surroundings to the cold ice cream. The ice cream melts slower because less heat reaches it. Insulators do not just keep hot things hot — they also keep cold things cold by blocking heat flow.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because newspaper does not produce heat — it only blocks heat transfer. Option C is wrong because wrapping in an insulator slows heat transfer in both directions. Option D is wrong because newspaper definitely acts as an insulator and affects heat flow."

      "explanation_correct": "The hot air balloon works on the principle of convection. When the air inside the balloon is heated, it becomes less dense than the cooler air outside. Since less dense air rises (just like in convection currents), the balloon is lifted upward. This is the same principle that makes hot air rise in a room.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Conduction transfers heat through solids by vibration and cannot lift objects. Radiation is the transfer of heat through space and does not push objects upward. Friction is a force that resists motion and does not explain why the balloon rises."
