    "text": "Heat is a form of energy that flows from a hotter object to a colder object. Temperature is the measure of how hot or cold an object is. Heat and temperature are related but different - heat is energy while temperature is a measurement. A thermometer is used to measure temperature. Heat is transferred in three ways: conduction (through solids by particle vibration), convection (through fluids by particle movement), and radiation (through empty space without any medium). Materials that allow heat to pass through easily are called conductors of heat (metals). Materials that do not allow heat to pass through easily are called insulators (wood, plastic, air).",

Force is a push or pull, and pressure is the force applied over an area. Heat is a type of energy that can move from one place to another, causing things to become warmer or cooler."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is: Water at bottom is heated, Hot water rises, Cold water moves down to take its place, Convection current is established. This is the correct sequence of how convection works to heat water. The hot water at the bottom rises, and the colder water at the top moves down to take its place, creating a continuous convection current that heats the water.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order is: Hot water rises, Water at bottom is heated, Cold water moves down to take its place, Convection current is established. This is not correct because the process starts with the water at the bottom being heated first, which then causes the hot water to rise up. The cold water then moves down to take the place of the rising hot water, and this continuous cycle creates the convection current that heats the water."
