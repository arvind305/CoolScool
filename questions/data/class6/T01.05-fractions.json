    "text": "A fraction represents a part of a whole or division of one number by another. It has a numerator (top) and denominator (bottom). Fractions can be proper (numerator < denominator), improper (numerator ≥ denominator), or mixed (whole number + proper fraction). Equivalent fractions have the same value, and fractions can be compared, ordered, and used in arithmetic operations.",
    "rules": [
      "A fraction a/b means a divided by b, where b ≠ 0",
      "Proper fraction: numerator < denominator (e.g., 3/4)",
      "Improper fraction: numerator ≥ denominator (e.g., 7/4)",
      "Mixed fraction: whole number + proper fraction (e.g., 1 3/4)",
      "Equivalent fractions: multiply or divide both numerator and denominator by same non-zero number",
      "To add/subtract fractions: find common denominator, then add/subtract numerators",
      "To multiply fractions: multiply numerators and denominators separately",
      "To divide fractions: multiply by the reciprocal of the divisor"
