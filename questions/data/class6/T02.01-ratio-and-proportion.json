      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "The answer is C) 7 and 30. In a proportion, the first and last numbers (7 and 30) are called the 'extreme terms', and the middle numbers (15 and 14) are called the 'mean terms'. The extreme terms are multiplied to get the same result as multiplying the mean terms, which shows that the two ratios are equal.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answers do not represent a true proportion. For a proportion to be true, the cross-multiplication of the extreme and mean terms must give the same result. In the correct answer C) 7 and 30, the cross-multiplication of 7 and 30 is equal to the multiplication of the mean terms 15 and 14, which shows that the two ratios are equal and form a true proportion."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "The ratio 9:13 is equal to the ratio 18:26, because both ratios have the same proportionality. This means that the two ratios are equivalent, and the values in the second ratio (18 and 26) are simply multiples of the first ratio (9 and 13).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option C is correct because the ratios 9:13 and 18:26 are equivalent, meaning they have the same proportionality. This is why the second ratio has values that are multiples of the first ratio. The other options do not represent equivalent ratios, so they are incorrect."
