    "text": "A ratio compares two quantities of the same kind, written as a:b or a/b. Ratios can be simplified by dividing by their HCF. A proportion states that two ratios are equal (a:b::c:d), where b and c are mean terms, a and d are extreme terms. Cross-multiplication verifies proportions: a×d = b×c.",
    "rules": [
      "Both quantities in a ratio must be of the same kind and in the same units",
      "Simplify ratios by dividing both terms by their HCF",
      "In proportion a:b::c:d, product of extremes equals product of means",
      "To divide a quantity in ratio a:b, use parts a/(a+b) and b/(a+b)",
      "Equivalent ratios are obtained by multiplying or dividing both terms by the same number"
