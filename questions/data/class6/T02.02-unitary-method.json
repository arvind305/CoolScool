      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answers are A, C, and D. Finding the value of one unit is the first step, but you also need to multiply it by the number of items needed to get the total cost. Dividing the total cost by the number of items would give you the average cost per item, not the total cost. More units do not necessarily give more value - the total cost depends on both the unit cost and the number of items."
