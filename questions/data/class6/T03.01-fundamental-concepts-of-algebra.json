    "text": "Algebra uses letters (variables) to represent unknown values and numbers (constants) that don't change. Algebraic expressions combine variables and constants using operations. A term is a single part of an expression, and its coefficient is the number multiplying the variable. Like terms have the same variable, unlike terms differ. We evaluate expressions by substituting values for variables, and simplify by combining like terms.",
    "rules": [
      "Variables are represented by letters (a, b, x, y, etc.)",
      "Constants are fixed numerical values",
      "A term is a single mathematical expression (e.g., 5x, -3y, 7)",
      "The coefficient is the numerical part of a term with a variable",
      "Like terms have identical variable parts and can be combined",
      "Unlike terms have different variables and cannot be combined",
      "To evaluate an expression, substitute given values for variables",
