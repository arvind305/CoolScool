    "text": "Geometry begins with basic concepts: a point has no dimensions (only position), a line extends infinitely in both directions, a ray has one endpoint and extends infinitely in one direction, and a line segment has two endpoints with finite length. Points are collinear if they lie on the same line. Surfaces can be plane (flat) or curved.",

      "A point has no length, width, or height - only position",

      "A line segment has two endpoints and finite length",
      "Three or more points are collinear if they lie on the same straight line",
      "Points not lying on the same line are non-collinear",
      "A plane surface is flat (like a table top)",
