This is wrong because a diameter is more restrictive than a chord, as a diameter must pass through the center of the circle. A chord can be any line segment connecting two points on the circle, which is less restrictive than a diameter. The correct order is to go from most restrictive (diameter) to least restrictive (circumference)."
