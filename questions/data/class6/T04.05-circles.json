    "text": "A circle is a closed curve where all points are equidistant from a fixed point called the centre. The radius is the distance from centre to any point on the circle. The diameter passes through the centre connecting two points on the circle, where d=2r. A chord connects any two points on the circle. An arc is a part of the circle's circumference, and a semicircle is exactly half of the circle.",
