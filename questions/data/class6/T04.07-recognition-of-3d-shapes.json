Common 3D shapes include cube (6 faces, 12 edges, 8 vertices), cuboid (6 faces, 12 edges, 8 vertices), cylinder (2 flat circular faces and 1 curved surface), cone (1 flat circular face, 1 curved surface, 1 vertex), and sphere (1 curved surface). Faces can be flat or curved. 2D nets can be folded to form 3D shapes.",

A cylinder has 2 flat circular faces and 1 curved surface, which matches the description of 2 flat and 1 curved given in the question. Option B) Cone has 1 flat circular face and 1 curved surface, so it does not match the description. Option C) Sphere has only 1 curved surface, and option D) Cube and Cuboid have 6 flat faces, so neither of those options are correct."
