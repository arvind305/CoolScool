    "text": "3D shapes (solids) are objects that have three dimensions: length, width, and height. Common 3D shapes include cube (6 faces, 12 edges, 8 vertices), cuboid (6 faces, 12 edges, 8 vertices), cylinder (2 flat circular faces and 1 curved surface), cone (1 flat circular face, 1 curved surface, 1 vertex), and sphere (1 curved surface). Faces can be flat or curved. 2D nets can be folded to form 3D shapes.",
    "rules": [
      "A cube has 6 square faces, 12 edges, and 8 vertices",
      "A cuboid has 6 rectangular faces, 12 edges, and 8 vertices",
      "A cylinder has 2 flat circular faces and 1 curved surface",
      "A cone has 1 flat circular face, 1 curved surface, and 1 vertex at the top",
      "A sphere has only 1 curved surface with no edges or vertices",
      "Faces are flat surfaces, while curved surfaces are rounded",
      "2D nets are flat patterns that can be folded to create 3D shapes"
