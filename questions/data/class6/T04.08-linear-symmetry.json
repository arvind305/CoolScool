      "explanation_correct": "The answer is 'distance' because in a symmetric figure, each point on one side of the line of symmetry must be at an equal distance from the line as its matching point on the other side. This is what allows the two halves of the figure to line up perfectly when folded along the line of symmetry.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is a single word, 'distance'. The reason 'distance' is the correct answer is that in a symmetric figure, the corresponding points on each side of the line of symmetry must be equidistant from the line. This means they are the same distance away from the line, which allows the two halves to match up perfectly when the figure is folded along the line of symmetry."
