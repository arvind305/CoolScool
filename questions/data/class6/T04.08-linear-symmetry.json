  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Line symmetry exists when a figure can be folded along a line so that both halves match exactly. This line is called the line of symmetry or mirror line. Regular polygons have multiple lines of symmetry, while some shapes have one or none. Reflection symmetry helps us complete figures by mirroring one half across the line of symmetry.",
    "rules": [
      "A line of symmetry divides a figure into two identical halves that are mirror images",
      "Some figures have multiple lines of symmetry (e.g., a square has 4)",
      "A circle has infinite lines of symmetry passing through its center",
      "To test for symmetry, fold the figure along the proposed line - both halves should match exactly",
      "Regular polygons with n sides have n lines of symmetry"
