    "text": "Geometrical constructions use ruler and compass to accurately draw line segments, angles, and perpendiculars. Key constructions include copying line segments, constructing perpendicular bisectors, creating angles of 60°, 90°, and 120°, bisecting angles, and drawing perpendiculars from points.",

      "Always use a sharp pencil and compass for accurate constructions",
      "Keep compass width fixed when drawing arcs for a construction",

      "60° angle is constructed using equilateral triangle properties",
      "90° angle can be constructed using perpendicular bisector method",
      "120° angle equals 180° - 60°",
