The square with the side length of 3 cm has an area of 3 cm x 3 cm = 9 cm², the square with the side length of 5 cm has an area of 5 cm x 5 cm = 25 cm², the square with the side length of 7 cm has an area of 7 cm x 7 cm = 49 cm², and the square with the side length of 9 cm has an area of 9 cm x 9 cm = 81 cm².
