    "text": "Perimeter is the total distance around a plane figure, calculated by adding all side lengths. Area is the space enclosed within a figure's boundaries. For rectangles: P=2(l+b), A=l×b; for squares: P=4s, A=s²; for right triangles: A=½×b×h. Combined shapes are broken into rectangles/squares.",

      "Perimeter is always expressed in linear units (cm, m, etc.)",
      "Area is always expressed in square units (cm², m², etc.)",
      "For rectangles: Perimeter = 2(length + breadth), Area = length × breadth",
      "For squares: Perimeter = 4 × side, Area = side²",
      "For right triangles: Area = ½ × base × height",
