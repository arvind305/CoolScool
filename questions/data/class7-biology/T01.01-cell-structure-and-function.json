    "text": "The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of all living organisms. Robert Hooke discovered cells in 1665 when he observed cork under a microscope. The cell theory states that all living things are made of cells, cells are the basic unit of life, and all cells arise from pre-existing cells. Cells have three main parts: cell membrane (controls what enters and leaves), cytoplasm (jelly-like substance containing organelles), and nucleus (control center containing genetic material). Cell organelles include mitochondria (powerhouse), ribosomes (protein synthesis), endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi body, and lysosomes. Plant cells differ from animal cells by having a cell wall, large central vacuole, and chloroplasts. Organisms can be unicellular (like Amoeba) or multicellular (like plants and animals).",

Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, responsible for producing the energy currency (ATP) that the cell uses to carry out its activities. Without functioning mitochondria, the cell would not be able to generate the energy it needs to survive and carry out its essential processes.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The other options are incorrect because: A) The cell would still be able to produce proteins even without functioning mitochondria, as the ribosomes responsible for protein synthesis are located in the cytoplasm. C) The cell wall would not break, as the cell wall is a structure found only in plant cells, not animal cells. D) The cell would not become green, as the chloroplasts responsible for the green color in plants are a different organelle from the mitochondria."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct order is Chloroplasts, Chromoplasts, Leucoplasts. Chloroplasts are the main photosynthetic organelles in plant cells. Chromoplasts contain pigments that give color to flowers and fruits. Leucoplasts are non-pigmented plastids that store substances like starch, oil, and protein for the plant. The order should be from the plastid responsible for photosynthesis to the ones responsible for storage."
