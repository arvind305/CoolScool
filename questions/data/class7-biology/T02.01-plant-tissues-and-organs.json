    "text": "A tissue is a group of similar cells that perform a specific function. Plant tissues are of two main types: meristematic and permanent. Meristematic tissues are found at growing tips and are composed of actively dividing cells. They are of three types: apical (at tips), lateral (on sides), and intercalary (at nodes). Permanent tissues are formed when meristematic cells lose their ability to divide. Simple permanent tissues include parenchyma (storage and photosynthesis), collenchyma (flexibility and support), and sclerenchyma (mechanical strength). Complex permanent tissues include xylem (water transport) and phloem (food transport). Plant organs include roots (absorption and anchorage), stems (support and transport), and leaves (photosynthesis and transpiration).",

This is because the upper epidermis is the outermost layer, followed by the palisade mesophyll (which has column-like cells for photosynthesis), then the spongy mesophyll (with loosely packed cells), and finally the vascular bundle (which transports water and nutrients).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: upper epidermis, spongy mesophyll, palisade mesophyll, and vascular bundle. This is wrong because the palisade mesophyll, which has column-like cells for photosynthesis, should be placed before the spongy mesophyll, which has loosely packed cells. The vascular bundle, which transports water and nutrients, should be the innermost layer."

Organ systems are made up of multiple organs, not the other way around. The correct order should be from the smallest level (cell) to the largest (organ system)."
