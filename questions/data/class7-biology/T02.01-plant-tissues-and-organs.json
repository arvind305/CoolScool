    "text": "A tissue is a group of similar cells that perform a specific function. Plant tissues are of two main types: meristematic and permanent. Meristematic tissues are found at growing tips and are composed of actively dividing cells. They are of three types: apical (at tips), lateral (on sides), and intercalary (at nodes). Permanent tissues are formed when meristematic cells lose their ability to divide. Simple permanent tissues include parenchyma (storage and photosynthesis), collenchyma (flexibility and support), and sclerenchyma (mechanical strength). Complex permanent tissues include xylem (water transport) and phloem (food transport). Plant organs include roots (absorption and anchorage), stems (support and transport), and leaves (photosynthesis and transpiration).",
