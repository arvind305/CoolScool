    "text": "Animal tissues are classified into four main types: epithelial, connective, muscular, and nervous. Epithelial tissue covers body surfaces and lines cavities, providing protection and secretion. Types include squamous, cuboidal, columnar, and ciliated epithelium. Connective tissue supports and connects different parts of the body; it includes blood, bone, cartilage, and adipose tissue. Muscular tissue enables movement through contraction and has three types: striated (voluntary, attached to bones), unstriated (involuntary, in internal organs), and cardiac (involuntary, found only in the heart). Nervous tissue consists of neurons that transmit electrical impulses for coordination and response to stimuli.",
    "rules": [
      "Epithelial tissue covers and lines body surfaces and cavities",
      "Squamous epithelium has flat cells found in blood vessels and alveoli",
      "Connective tissue has cells in a matrix and connects body parts",
      "Blood is a fluid connective tissue",
      "Bone is hard connective tissue with calcium in matrix",
      "Striated muscle is voluntary and attached to skeleton",
      "Unstriated muscle is involuntary and found in internal organs",
      "Cardiac muscle is involuntary and found only in heart",
