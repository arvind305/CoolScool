    "text": "Animal tissues are classified into four main types: epithelial, connective, muscular, and nervous. Epithelial tissue covers body surfaces and lines cavities, providing protection and secretion. Types include squamous, cuboidal, columnar, and ciliated epithelium. Connective tissue supports and connects different parts of the body; it includes blood, bone, cartilage, and adipose tissue. Muscular tissue enables movement through contraction and has three types: striated (voluntary, attached to bones), unstriated (involuntary, in internal organs), and cardiac (involuntary, found only in the heart). Nervous tissue consists of neurons that transmit electrical impulses for coordination and response to stimuli.",

      "Epithelial tissue covers and lines body surfaces and cavities",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Bone and cartilage are both connective tissues, but they differ significantly in the hardness of their matrix. Bone is hard and rigid because its matrix is strengthened by calcium salts. Cartilage is firm yet flexible because its matrix is made of protein fibres without calcium deposits.

      "explanation_correct": "Blood is the surprising member of the connective tissue family. Most connective tissues like bone, cartilage, and tendons are solid and clearly 'connect' body parts. Blood is a liquid, which makes students think it cannot be connective tissue. However, blood is classified as connective tissue because its cells are dispersed in a matrix (plasma), and it connects different body parts by transporting materials between them.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Bone, cartilage, and adipose tissue are all solid or semi-solid connective tissues that clearly fit the idea of 'connecting' or 'supporting' body parts. None of these seem out of place as connective tissues. Blood is the exception that surprises students because it is a liquid, yet it is classified as connective tissue due to its matrix structure and its role in connecting body parts through transport."

Cardiac muscle shows clear striations (alternating dark and light bands) under the microscope, yet it is completely involuntary — we cannot consciously control our heartbeat.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Smooth muscle in the intestine and blood vessels does not show striations and is involuntary — no surprise there. Skeletal muscle in the arm shows striations and is voluntary — again, no surprise. The exception is cardiac muscle, which looks striated like skeletal muscle but behaves like smooth muscle in being involuntary. This is a common exam trick question."

It is made of calcium phosphate crystals and has a different structure from bone. This proves that not all hard tissues are bones. Students commonly assume that anything hard in the body must be bone, but enamel is a clear exception.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Blood is a fluid connective tissue, not hard at all. Cartilage in the nose is firm but flexible, not truly hard like bone. Adipose tissue (fat) does not become hard — it remains soft. The best example that disproves 'all hard tissues are bones' is tooth enamel, which is harder than bone but has a completely different tissue structure."

When you decide to move your arm, your brain sends a signal through nerves to the striated muscles, which then contract to produce the movement. This conscious control is what makes it voluntary.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A describes involuntary smooth muscle found in internal organs. Option C describes connective tissue characteristics, not muscle. Option D describes cardiac muscle that contracts rhythmically on its own. Striated muscle is voluntary specifically because it is connected to the skeleton and controlled by deliberate signals from the brain — you choose when and how to move it."

      "explanation_correct": "Injuries to the brain or spinal cord often cause permanent damage because neurons are highly specialised cells that have largely lost the ability to divide and reproduce. Unlike skin cells or blood cells that can regenerate through cell division, mature neurons cannot easily be replaced once damaged. This is why nervous tissue injuries are so serious.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Nervous tissue does not have a hard matrix — it is soft. The brain and spinal cord actually have a rich blood supply. There is no epithelial tissue barrier preventing neuron repair. The real reason is that neurons are so highly specialised for transmitting electrical impulses that they have given up the ability to divide. This makes damage to nervous tissue much more permanent than damage to other tissues."

      "explanation_correct": "Cardiac muscle is involuntary because it is regulated by the autonomic nervous system and contains specialised pacemaker cells that generate rhythmic electrical impulses on their own. Unlike skeletal muscle, which needs conscious brain signals to contract, cardiac muscle beats automatically. The striations are due to the arrangement of protein fibres for contraction, but the type of nerve control determines whether a muscle is voluntary or involuntary.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Cardiac muscle is found in the heart, not the stomach. Its cells are branched, not flat and thin. It does contain contractile proteins (actin and myosin), which cause the striations. The real reason it is involuntary is that it is controlled by the autonomic nervous system and has its own pacemaker cells. Striations relate to the internal structure of the muscle fibre, not to whether it is voluntary or involuntary."
