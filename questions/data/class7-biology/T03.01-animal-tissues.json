    "text": "Animal tissues are classified into four main types: epithelial, connective, muscular, and nervous. Epithelial tissue covers body surfaces and lines cavities, providing protection and secretion. Types include squamous, cuboidal, columnar, and ciliated epithelium. Connective tissue supports and connects different parts of the body; it includes blood, bone, cartilage, and adipose tissue. Muscular tissue enables movement through contraction and has three types: striated (voluntary, attached to bones), unstriated (involuntary, in internal organs), and cardiac (involuntary, found only in the heart). Nervous tissue consists of neurons that transmit electrical impulses for coordination and response to stimuli.",

Striated muscle has a very organized structure that allows for quick, precise movements, making it the fastest contracting type.
