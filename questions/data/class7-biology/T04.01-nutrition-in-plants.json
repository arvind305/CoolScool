  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Nutrition is the process by which organisms obtain and utilize food for energy, growth, and repair. Plants are autotrophs that make their own food through photosynthesis. Photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts using sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce glucose and oxygen. The equation is: Carbon dioxide + Water (in presence of sunlight and chlorophyll) produces Glucose + Oxygen. Stomata on leaves allow gas exchange. Some plants have special modes of nutrition: parasitic plants like Cuscuta obtain food from host plants; insectivorous plants like Venus flytrap trap and digest insects; saprophytes like fungi obtain nutrients from dead matter. Plants require macro and micronutrients for growth, with nitrogen being essential for protein synthesis.",
