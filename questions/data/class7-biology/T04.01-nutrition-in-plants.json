    "text": "Nutrition is the process by which organisms obtain and utilize food for energy, growth, and repair. Plants are autotrophs that make their own food through photosynthesis. Photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts using sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce glucose and oxygen. The equation is: Carbon dioxide + Water (in presence of sunlight and chlorophyll) produces Glucose + Oxygen. Stomata on leaves allow gas exchange. Some plants have special modes of nutrition: parasitic plants like Cuscuta obtain food from host plants; insectivorous plants like Venus flytrap trap and digest insects; saprophytes like fungi obtain nutrients from dead matter. Plants require macro and micronutrients for growth, with nitrogen being essential for protein synthesis.",

The bacteria live in the roots of the legume plant and help fix nitrogen from the air into a form that the plant can use for growth, while the plant provides the bacteria with food in the form of glucose made through photosynthesis.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option C is correct because in this symbiotic relationship, the legume plant and the Rhizobium bacteria work together to help each other. The bacteria live in the plant's roots and help the plant access nitrogen, which is important for growth. In return, the plant provides food for the bacteria in the form of glucose produced during photosynthesis. This mutually beneficial arrangement allows both the plant and bacteria to thrive."

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "The plant Priya observed is most likely a pitcher plant, which is an insectivorous plant. It has green leaves with chlorophyll and can photosynthesise to produce glucose. However, it grows in nutrient-poor soil, especially soil that is deficient in nitrogen. By trapping and digesting insects, the plant obtains nitrogen, which is essential for making proteins and other vital molecules. This is why insectivorous plants supplement their photosynthetic nutrition with insect-derived nitrogen.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because the plant has green leaves, indicating it has chlorophyll and can photosynthesise. Option C is incorrect because insectivorous plants do not trap insects for water; water is typically available in their marshy habitats. Option D is wrong because the guide clearly stated the insects are digested, which means the plant absorbs nutrients from them."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Moong (green gram) is a leguminous plant. Legumes have a symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria that live in special nodules on their roots. These bacteria can fix atmospheric nitrogen, converting it from nitrogen gas in the air into nitrogen compounds that plants can absorb and use. After the legume crop is harvested, the nitrogen-rich root nodules decompose and release nitrogen into the soil, enriching it for the next crop. This is the scientific basis behind crop rotation with legumes.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because legumes do not release pesticides. Option C is wrong because the benefit of legumes is not about absorbing excess water. Option D is incorrect because plants do not produce oxygen underground in a way that improves soil. The real benefit is nitrogen fixation by Rhizobium bacteria in the root nodules of the leguminous plant."

Cuscuta is a parasitic plant, mushroom is a saprophyte, and lichen is a symbiotic association of algae and fungi.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Cuscuta is a parasitic plant that feeds on living hosts, not an insectivorous plant. Mushroom is a saprophyte that feeds on dead organic matter. Lichen is a symbiotic association of an alga and a fungus. Bladderwort is the correct answer because it is a genuine insectivorous plant with small bladder-like traps that capture tiny aquatic organisms."

In reality, insectivorous plants like the Venus flytrap, sundew, and pitcher plant all have chlorophyll and are capable of photosynthesis. They produce their own glucose through photosynthesis and are primarily autotrophic. They trap insects specifically to obtain nitrogen, which is scarce in the nutrient-poor soils where they grow. So they are not heterotrophs; they are autotrophs that supplement their nitrogen intake.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because insectivorous plants are not fully heterotrophic; they can make their own food through photosynthesis. Option C is wrong because they trap insects for nitrogen, not water. Option D is wrong because saprophytes feed on dead matter, while insectivorous plants trap living insects and are fundamentally photosynthetic organisms."

Although they can photosynthesise and produce glucose using their chlorophyll, they cannot obtain enough nitrogen from the soil to make proteins and other essential nitrogen-containing molecules. By trapping and digesting insects, they obtain the nitrogen they need. This is why they have evolved insect-trapping mechanisms despite being autotrophic.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because the chlorophyll in insectivorous plants is fully functional and they do photosynthesise effectively. Option C is incorrect because water is readily available in their marshy habitats. Option D is wrong because plants obtain CO2 from the atmosphere through stomata, not from decomposing insects. The correct reason is that these plants need nitrogen from insects because their soil lacks sufficient nitrogen."

      "explanation_correct": "The classification of an organism as a parasite or saprophyte depends on the source of its nutrition, not its ability to photosynthesise. Cuscuta is classified as a parasite because it obtains nutrients from a living host plant by attaching to it and penetrating its tissues with haustoria. Saprophytes, like mushrooms and bread mould, obtain their nutrients from dead and decaying organic matter by secreting enzymes and absorbing the dissolved nutrients. The critical difference is living host vs. dead matter.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because saprophytes can be fungi (which are neither plants nor animals) and the distinction is not about the kingdom they belong to. Option C is incorrect because Cuscuta actually lacks true roots and uses haustoria instead. Option D is wrong because the mode of reproduction does not determine whether an organism is a parasite or saprophyte. The defining criterion is the source of nutrition: living host for parasites, dead matter for saprophytes."
