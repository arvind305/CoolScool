    "text": "Animals are heterotrophs that obtain nutrition by consuming other organisms. Holozoic nutrition involves ingesting solid food and digesting it internally, as seen in most animals. The human digestive system consists of the alimentary canal and digestive glands. Food passes through the mouth (where saliva containing amylase begins starch digestion), oesophagus (peristalsis moves food), stomach (gastric juice with pepsin digests proteins), small intestine (where most digestion and absorption occurs through villi), and large intestine (water absorption). Digestive glands include salivary glands, liver (produces bile), and pancreas (produces digestive enzymes). The five steps of nutrition are ingestion, digestion, absorption, assimilation, and egestion.",

Most of the digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs in the small intestine, especially in the duodenum and jejunum, where the presence of villi helps to increase the surface area for absorption.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer is that the large intestine is where most of the nutrients are absorbed. This is not true because the main function of the large intestine is to absorb water from the undigested food and to store the waste material before it is eliminated from the body. The small intestine, especially the duodenum and jejunum, is the primary site of nutrient absorption."
