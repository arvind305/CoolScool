    "text": "Animals are heterotrophs that obtain nutrition by consuming other organisms. Holozoic nutrition involves ingesting solid food and digesting it internally, as seen in most animals. The human digestive system consists of the alimentary canal and digestive glands. Food passes through the mouth (where saliva containing amylase begins starch digestion), oesophagus (peristalsis moves food), stomach (gastric juice with pepsin digests proteins), small intestine (where most digestion and absorption occurs through villi), and large intestine (water absorption). Digestive glands include salivary glands, liver (produces bile), and pancreas (produces digestive enzymes). The five steps of nutrition are ingestion, digestion, absorption, assimilation, and egestion.",
