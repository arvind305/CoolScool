    "text": "Respiration is the process of breaking down food (glucose) to release energy. Breathing is the physical process of taking in oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide, while cellular respiration is the chemical process that occurs in cells. Aerobic respiration uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide, water, and lots of energy: Glucose + Oxygen produces Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy. Anaerobic respiration occurs without oxygen and produces less energy; in yeast it produces alcohol and CO2 (fermentation), in muscles it produces lactic acid. The human respiratory system includes nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs with alveoli for gas exchange. Breathing involves inhalation (diaphragm contracts, ribs move up) and exhalation (diaphragm relaxes, ribs move down).",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Digestion is the process of breaking down food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed by the body. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create food (glucose). Excretion is the process of removing waste products from the body. Respiration is the specific process of breaking down food to release energy, which is what this question is asking about."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Earthworms breathe through their moist skin by absorbing oxygen from the air in soil spaces. When heavy rain fills these soil spaces with water, the oxygen available in the soil decreases significantly. The earthworms are forced to come to the surface where they can access atmospheric oxygen through their moist skin. This is a survival response to avoid suffocation underground.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Earthworms do not come out primarily to find food or drink water. The temperature of the soil does not drop drastically enough after rain to drive them out. The real reason is respiratory — when rainwater fills the air pockets in the soil, oxygen becomes scarce underground. Since earthworms breathe through their moist skin by absorbing oxygen from surrounding air, they must come to the surface to access oxygen."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "This is a common misconception. Plants do respire all the time — during both day and night. Respiration is essential for plants to release energy from glucose for their life processes. During the day, plants carry out both photosynthesis and respiration simultaneously. At night, only respiration continues. Photosynthesis and respiration are separate processes, and one does not replace the other.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Plants do not stop respiring when they are photosynthesizing. Respiration is a continuous process needed for energy in all living cells. Plants do not respire only at night — they respire during the day as well, alongside photosynthesis. Respiration also occurs in all living plant cells at all times, not just during growth periods."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Anaerobic respiration does occur in the human body, specifically in muscle cells during intense physical activity. When muscles work very hard and the oxygen supply cannot keep up with demand, the muscle cells switch to anaerobic respiration. This produces lactic acid (not alcohol) and releases a small amount of energy. The lactic acid build-up is what causes muscle cramps and soreness after vigorous exercise.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Humans do not always use aerobic respiration — during intense exercise, muscles switch to anaerobic respiration. Lungs do not carry out anaerobic respiration, and human cells never produce alcohol during anaerobic respiration (that is what yeast does). Anaerobic respiration in human muscles produces lactic acid, not CO2 and water — those are products of aerobic respiration."

This is a classic exception — not all aquatic animals use gills for breathing.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Sharks, rohu, and pomfret are all fish that breathe through gills as expected for aquatic animals. The whale is the exception because, despite living in water, it is a mammal that breathes through lungs and must surface to take in air.

        }
      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Aerobic respiration is the preferred mode because, in the presence of oxygen, glucose is completely broken down into carbon dioxide and water, releasing a large amount of energy (about 38 ATP molecules per glucose). In anaerobic respiration, glucose is only partially broken down, yielding much less energy (about 2 ATP). Since organisms need substantial energy for their life processes, aerobic respiration is far more efficient and is the default pathway whenever oxygen is available.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Aerobic respiration does require glucose — it is a key reactant. Lactic acid is a waste product of anaerobic respiration in muscles, not a useful product of aerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration is not necessarily faster — anaerobic respiration can produce energy more quickly but in much smaller quantities. The main reason aerobic is preferred is the significantly higher energy yield from complete glucose breakdown."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Alveoli have extremely thin walls (just one cell thick) so that gases can diffuse quickly across them. The rich network of blood capillaries around each alveolus ensures that oxygen can rapidly pass from the air inside the alveolus into the blood, while carbon dioxide moves from the blood into the alveolus to be exhaled. This structural design maximises the efficiency of gas exchange, which is the primary function of the lungs.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Alveoli are not designed to store air — they are designed for gas exchange. Mucus production occurs in the nasal passages and bronchial lining, not in the alveoli. Keeping the lungs warm is not the purpose of thin walls and blood supply. The thin walls and rich capillary network exist specifically to enable fast and efficient diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between air and blood."

In photosynthesis, plants use carbon dioxide and water (with sunlight) to produce glucose and oxygen. In respiration, glucose and oxygen are broken down to produce carbon dioxide, water, and energy. The inputs of one process are the outputs of the other, making them chemically opposite.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Respiration occurs in both plants and animals, not only in animals. Respiration occurs all the time (day and night), not just at night. Respiration is definitely a chemical reaction — it involves the breakdown of glucose. The correct reason is that the reactants and products of respiration are the exact reverse of those in photosynthesis."
