    "text": "Respiration is the process of breaking down food (glucose) to release energy. Breathing is the physical process of taking in oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide, while cellular respiration is the chemical process that occurs in cells. Aerobic respiration uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide, water, and lots of energy: Glucose + Oxygen produces Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy. Anaerobic respiration occurs without oxygen and produces less energy; in yeast it produces alcohol and CO2 (fermentation), in muscles it produces lactic acid. The human respiratory system includes nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs with alveoli for gas exchange. Breathing involves inhalation (diaphragm contracts, ribs move up) and exhalation (diaphragm relaxes, ribs move down).",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Digestion is the process of breaking down food into smaller molecules that can be absorbed by the body. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create food (glucose). Excretion is the process of removing waste products from the body. Respiration is the specific process of breaking down food to release energy, which is what this question is asking about."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is: Diaphragm relaxes and domes up, Ribs move down and in, Chest cavity decreases in size, Air is pushed out of lungs. This is because when the diaphragm muscle relaxes, it moves up, making the chest cavity smaller. This decreases the space in the lungs, pushing the air out.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Air is pushed out of lungs, Ribs move down and in, Diaphragm relaxes and domes up, Chest cavity decreases in size. This is wrong because the diaphragm muscle relaxing and moving up is the first step, which then leads to the chest cavity becoming smaller and air being pushed out of the lungs."
