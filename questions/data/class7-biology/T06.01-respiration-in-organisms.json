    "text": "Respiration is the process of breaking down food (glucose) to release energy. Breathing is the physical process of taking in oxygen and releasing carbon dioxide, while cellular respiration is the chemical process that occurs in cells. Aerobic respiration uses oxygen and produces carbon dioxide, water, and lots of energy: Glucose + Oxygen produces Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy. Anaerobic respiration occurs without oxygen and produces less energy; in yeast it produces alcohol and CO2 (fermentation), in muscles it produces lactic acid. The human respiratory system includes nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, and lungs with alveoli for gas exchange. Breathing involves inhalation (diaphragm contracts, ribs move up) and exhalation (diaphragm relaxes, ribs move down).",
