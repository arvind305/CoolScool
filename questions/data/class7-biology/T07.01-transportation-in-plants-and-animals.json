    "text": "Transportation is essential for moving nutrients, oxygen, and waste products in living organisms. In plants, xylem transports water and minerals from roots to leaves (upward), while phloem transports food from leaves to all parts (translocation). Transpiration creates a pull that helps water rise in tall plants. In animals, the circulatory system transports substances. Blood consists of plasma (55%), red blood cells (carry oxygen using hemoglobin), white blood cells (fight infection), and platelets (help in clotting). The heart is a four-chambered muscular organ that pumps blood. Arteries carry blood away from the heart (thick walls), veins carry blood toward the heart (have valves), and capillaries are thin-walled vessels for exchange. Blood groups are A, B, AB, and O.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The phloem is the tissue that transports food (like sugars) made in the leaves to other parts of the plant. It does not transport water and minerals, which is the job of the xylem tissue. The parenchyma and epidermis are not responsible for long-distance transport in plants."

      "explanation_correct": "Arjun is looking at an artery. Arteries have thick, muscular walls to handle the high blood pressure generated by the heart's pumping. They carry blood away from the heart and do not have internal valves (unlike veins). All three features described in the diagram match the characteristics of an artery.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Veins have thinner walls and contain valves, and they carry blood toward the heart, not away from it. Capillaries have extremely thin walls (one cell thick), not thick muscular walls. Lymph vessels are part of the lymphatic system and do not carry blood. The combination of thick walls, no valves, and high-pressure blood flowing away from the heart identifies the vessel as an artery."

Blood does transport oxygen (via RBCs), fight infections (via WBCs), and carry waste products like urea to the kidneys for excretion. Students sometimes confuse transportation with digestion, but blood only transports nutrients after digestion, it does not digest food.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Transporting oxygen, fighting infections, and carrying waste products are all genuine functions of blood. Red blood cells carry oxygen using hemoglobin, white blood cells protect against disease, and plasma carries dissolved waste products to the kidneys. Digestion, however, happens in the digestive system using enzymes and is not a function of blood."

      "explanation_correct": "On a hot and windy day, the temperature increases evaporation of water from the leaf surface through stomata, and the wind blows away the moist air near the stomata, replacing it with drier air. This creates a steeper concentration gradient that causes water to evaporate even faster. Both factors together significantly increase the rate of transpiration.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Root absorption does not directly control transpiration rate. Phloem transports food, not water, so it is not related to transpiration. Stomata do not permanently close on hot days; they may close temporarily in extreme heat to conserve water, but generally they remain open during the day. The actual reason is that heat and wind both increase the rate of water evaporation from leaves."

The right ventricle only pumps blood to the nearby lungs (a shorter distance). Since the left ventricle needs to generate much more pressure, it has thicker muscular walls.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The left ventricle does not receive blood from the lungs (the left atrium does). It does not store more blood, and it is the right ventricle, not the left, that pumps blood to the lungs. The real reason is that the left ventricle must push blood through the entire body, which is a much longer and more demanding circuit than the short path to the lungs."

      "explanation_correct": "In a closed circulatory system, blood is enclosed within blood vessels (arteries, veins, and capillaries) throughout its journey. This allows blood to be pumped at higher pressure and directed precisely to specific organs and tissues that need it. This makes transport of oxygen, nutrients, and waste faster and more efficient compared to an open system where blood flows freely in body cavities.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Blood actually flows faster, not slower, in a closed system. In a closed system, blood does not come in direct contact with organs; it exchanges materials through capillary walls. A closed system still requires a heart to pump blood. The key advantage is that vessels allow directed, high-pressure flow, ensuring efficient delivery to all body parts."
