    "text": "Transportation is essential for moving nutrients, oxygen, and waste products in living organisms. In plants, xylem transports water and minerals from roots to leaves (upward), while phloem transports food from leaves to all parts (translocation). Transpiration creates a pull that helps water rise in tall plants. In animals, the circulatory system transports substances. Blood consists of plasma (55%), red blood cells (carry oxygen using hemoglobin), white blood cells (fight infection), and platelets (help in clotting). The heart is a four-chambered muscular organ that pumps blood. Arteries carry blood away from the heart (thick walls), veins carry blood toward the heart (have valves), and capillaries are thin-walled vessels for exchange. Blood groups are A, B, AB, and O.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The phloem is the tissue that transports food (like sugars) made in the leaves to other parts of the plant. It does not transport water and minerals, which is the job of the xylem tissue. The parenchyma and epidermis are not responsible for long-distance transport in plants."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Transpiration actually happens during the day, not at night.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The human heart does not beat 100 times per minute at rest. That would be too fast and indicate an abnormal heart rate.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The heartbeat sound is not caused by the closing of the arteries or veins in the body.
