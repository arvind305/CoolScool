  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Excretion is the removal of metabolic waste products from the body. It differs from egestion (removal of undigested food). Main metabolic wastes include carbon dioxide (from respiration), urea and uric acid (from protein breakdown), and excess water and salts. The human excretory system consists of two kidneys, two ureters, a urinary bladder, and a urethra. Kidneys filter blood and remove wastes to form urine. The kidney has an outer cortex, inner medulla, and a funnel-shaped pelvis. Nephrons are the functional units of kidneys. Urine is formed through filtration, reabsorption, and secretion. Other excretory organs include skin (sweat) and lungs (CO2). Plants excrete through stomata, bark shedding, and storage in vacuoles.",

      "Excretion removes metabolic wastes; egestion removes undigested food",
      "Main wastes: CO2, urea, uric acid, excess water and salts",
      "Kidneys are the main excretory organs in humans",
      "Each kidney contains about one million nephrons",
