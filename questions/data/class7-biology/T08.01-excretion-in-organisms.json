    "text": "Excretion is the removal of metabolic waste products from the body. It differs from egestion (removal of undigested food). Main metabolic wastes include carbon dioxide (from respiration), urea and uric acid (from protein breakdown), and excess water and salts. The human excretory system consists of two kidneys, two ureters, a urinary bladder, and a urethra. Kidneys filter blood and remove wastes to form urine. The kidney has an outer cortex, inner medulla, and a funnel-shaped pelvis. Nephrons are the functional units of kidneys. Urine is formed through filtration, reabsorption, and secretion. Other excretory organs include skin (sweat) and lungs (CO2). Plants excrete through stomata, bark shedding, and storage in vacuoles.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Excretion is the process of removing metabolic waste products from the body, such as carbon dioxide, urea, and uric acid. This is because these waste products are produced during the breakdown of food and other molecules in our cells, and need to be removed to keep our bodies healthy.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Excretion is not the process of removing undigested food or digested food, as those are handled by other body processes like digestion and egestion. Excretion specifically refers to the removal of metabolic waste products that are produced when our cells use up food and other molecules for energy and growth. Water can be part of the excretion process, but it is not the only thing that is removed."

They are responsible for filtering blood, reabsorbing useful substances, and secreting additional wastes to form urine. The description of a coiled structure that filters blood and exists in huge numbers within the kidney perfectly matches the nephron.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The ureter is the tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder — there are only two ureters in the body, not millions. The renal pelvis is the funnel-shaped collecting area inside the kidney, and there is only one per kidney. The urinary bladder is the organ that stores urine and is not located inside the kidney. Only the nephron fits all the described characteristics."

While the kidneys are the primary excretory organs, the skin plays a supporting role in removing waste from the body through perspiration.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The heart pumps blood throughout the body and has no excretory function. The stomach is involved in digestion, breaking down food with acids and enzymes. The small intestine is responsible for absorbing nutrients from digested food. None of these organs produce or remove metabolic waste from the body. The skin, however, does excrete waste products through sweat, making it the correct answer."

Faeces consist of undigested food residues that were never absorbed into the body's cells, so they are not metabolic waste products. Excretion specifically refers to the removal of metabolic wastes (like urea, carbon dioxide, and excess salts) that are produced by chemical reactions within the body's cells. The other three options are all genuine examples of excretion.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Removal of urea through urine is excretion (metabolic waste from protein breakdown removed by kidneys). Removal of carbon dioxide through exhaled air is excretion (metabolic waste from respiration removed by lungs). Removal of excess salts through sweat is excretion (metabolic waste removed by skin). Only the removal of faeces is egestion because faeces are undigested food, not metabolic waste."

      "explanation_correct": "While urine does contain waste products like urea and uric acid, it also contains a large amount of water and some dissolved salts. Water itself is not a waste product — it is essential for the body. However, the kidneys excrete excess water to maintain the body's water balance (osmoregulation). This means urine is not purely waste; it is a mixture of metabolic waste products dissolved in excess water. This is why the amount and concentration of urine changes depending on how much water a person drinks.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A supports the claim rather than challenging it, since urea is indeed a waste product. Options C and D describe where urine is produced and stored, but they do not address the question of whether urine contains only waste products. Only option B correctly identifies that urine contains water (a non-waste substance) excreted in excess to maintain the body's water balance."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Reabsorption is essential because the first step of urine formation, filtration, is non-selective. During filtration, blood pressure pushes water, glucose, amino acids, salts, urea, and other small molecules into the nephron. If the body did not reabsorb the useful substances like glucose and water, they would all be lost in the urine. Reabsorption ensures that the body recovers nutrients and the right amount of water, while only the true waste products remain to be excreted.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A describes secretion (adding waste), not reabsorption (recovering useful substances). Option C describes filtration, which is the first step and is different from reabsorption. Option D is incorrect because the colour of urine is determined by pigments like urochrome, not by whether reabsorption occurs. The real reason reabsorption is essential is to recover the useful substances that filtration non-selectively removes from the blood."

      "explanation_correct": "Nephrons are called the functional units of the kidney because they are the individual structures that carry out the actual work of the kidney — filtering blood, reabsorbing useful substances, and secreting additional wastes to produce urine. The cortex and medulla are regions (layers) of the kidney that contain parts of the nephrons, but they are not functional units themselves. A functional unit is the smallest structure that can independently perform the organ's main function, and in the kidney, that is the nephron.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because nephrons are actually microscopic — much smaller than the cortex or medulla. Option C is wrong because both the cortex and medulla are indeed found inside the kidney; they are its outer and inner layers respectively. Option D is incorrect because urine is stored in the urinary bladder, not in nephrons. The real reason nephrons are the functional units is that they perform the core processes of urine formation."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Plants do not have a dedicated circulatory system like the blood system in animals that can rapidly transport wastes to a central excretory organ. Since plants lack specialised excretory organs like kidneys, they use alternative methods for waste management. One of these methods is storing waste products in cell vacuoles, where the waste remains harmlessly sealed away from the active parts of the cell. Other wastes are removed through stomata, bark shedding, or by being stored in leaves that eventually fall off.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because vacuoles are storage compartments, not excretory organs. Option C is wrong because waste products are harmful or useless to the plant, not food. Option D is incorrect because plants generally produce less metabolic waste than animals since they can reuse many of their by-products (for example, oxygen from photosynthesis is used in respiration). The correct reason is that plants lack a transport-based excretory system like animals have."
