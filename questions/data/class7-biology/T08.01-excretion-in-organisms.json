    "text": "Excretion is the removal of metabolic waste products from the body. It differs from egestion (removal of undigested food). Main metabolic wastes include carbon dioxide (from respiration), urea and uric acid (from protein breakdown), and excess water and salts. The human excretory system consists of two kidneys, two ureters, a urinary bladder, and a urethra. Kidneys filter blood and remove wastes to form urine. The kidney has an outer cortex, inner medulla, and a funnel-shaped pelvis. Nephrons are the functional units of kidneys. Urine is formed through filtration, reabsorption, and secretion. Other excretory organs include skin (sweat) and lungs (CO2). Plants excrete through stomata, bark shedding, and storage in vacuoles.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Excretion is the process of removing metabolic waste products from the body, such as carbon dioxide, urea, and uric acid. This is because these waste products are produced during the breakdown of food and other molecules in our cells, and need to be removed to keep our bodies healthy.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Excretion is not the process of removing undigested food or digested food, as those are handled by other body processes like digestion and egestion. Excretion specifically refers to the removal of metabolic waste products that are produced when our cells use up food and other molecules for energy and growth. Water can be part of the excretion process, but it is not the only thing that is removed."

This is because blood flows from the renal artery into the capillaries in the nephron, where waste and excess substances are filtered out to form urine. The filtered blood then flows out of the kidney through the renal vein.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be capillaries in the nephron, renal artery, and then renal vein. This is wrong because the blood first enters the kidney through the renal artery, then flows into the capillaries in the nephron where filtration occurs, and finally exits the kidney through the renal vein. The blood vessels must be arranged in the correct sequence to show the path of blood flow through the kidney."
