  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Reproduction is the process by which organisms produce new individuals of their own kind. Plants reproduce by two main methods: asexual (without seeds, involving one parent) and sexual (with seeds, involving two parents). Asexual reproduction includes budding, fragmentation, spore formation, and vegetative propagation (using plant parts like roots, stems, leaves). Vegetative propagation can be natural (runners, tubers, bulbs) or artificial (cutting, layering, grafting). Sexual reproduction in flowering plants involves the flower. A flower has sepals (protection), petals (attract pollinators), stamens (male part with anther and filament), and carpel (female part with stigma, style, ovary). Pollination transfers pollen from anther to stigma (self or cross). Fertilization occurs when male and female gametes fuse, forming a zygote that develops into a seed inside a fruit.",
    "rules": [
      "Asexual reproduction involves one parent and produces identical offspring",
      "Sexual reproduction involves two parents and produces varied offspring",
      "Vegetative propagation uses vegetative parts like roots, stems, leaves",
      "Flower has four whorls: sepals, petals, stamens, carpel",
      "Stamen = anther (pollen) + filament",
      "Carpel = stigma + style + ovary (with ovules)",
      "Self-pollination: pollen transfers within same flower or plant",
      "Cross-pollination: pollen transfers between different plants",
      "Fertilization produces zygote that develops into embryo in seed"

Reproduction is specifically the process of making new individuals of the same species, so that the species can continue on to the next generation."

      "explanation_correct": "When pollen is transferred within the same flower or to another flower on the same plant, it is called self-pollination. This is because the male and female parts of the flower are on the same plant, allowing the pollen to fertilize the ovule without having to travel to another plant.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is self-pollination. Cross-pollination occurs when pollen is transferred between different plants, while fertilization is the process of the male and female gametes fusing to form a zygote. Budding is a form of asexual reproduction, which does not involve pollination or fertilization."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Bush A was grown from a stem cutting, which is artificial vegetative propagation (a type of asexual reproduction). Since only one parent's genetic material is involved, the offspring is genetically identical to the parent, so it produces the same red flowers. Bush B was grown from a seed, which is the result of sexual reproduction involving the fusion of gametes from two parents. This creates genetic variation, so Bush B's flowers are slightly different from the parent plant.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because the difference in flowers is not due to water. Option C is wrong because the different colour in Bush B is not a sign of poor health but of genetic variation from sexual reproduction. Option D is partially wrong because Bush A did not reproduce sexually; it was produced from a cutting (asexual reproduction), which is why it looks identical to the parent."

      "correct_answer": "D",
      "explanation_correct": "The coconut reached the beach through seed dispersal by water. Coconuts have a thick fibrous husk that makes them lightweight and buoyant, allowing them to float on water for long distances. This adaptation helps coconut palms spread to new coastal areas. The scenario describes the coconut washing ashore after floating across the sea, which is a clear example of water dispersal.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Dispersal by wind is used by light seeds with wings or hair-like structures (like dandelion), not heavy coconuts. Dispersal by explosion occurs in plants like balsam where the fruit bursts open. Dispersal by animals involves seeds that stick to animal fur or pass through animal digestive systems. The coconut's fibrous husk and its ability to float across the sea clearly indicate dispersal by water."

Students often confuse seed germination with asexual reproduction because they see only the plant growing from the soil. Budding, fragmentation, and spore formation are all genuine methods of asexual reproduction.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Yeast budding, Spirogyra fragmentation, and bread mould spore formation are all methods of asexual reproduction involving one parent.

      "explanation_correct": "Students often think of petals as merely decorative, but petals play a vital role in reproduction by attracting pollinators like bees, butterflies, and birds through their bright colours, fragrance, and nectar. Without pollinators, many plants cannot undergo cross-pollination, and seeds will not form. So while petals are not directly a reproductive organ, they are essential for the success of sexual reproduction in many flowering plants.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Petals do not produce pollen; that is the job of the anther in the stamen. Sepals do not contain ovules; ovules are found inside the ovary of the carpel. Sepals do not perform fertilization; fertilization is the fusion of male and female gametes inside the ovule. The correct answer recognises that petals have a critical indirect role in reproduction by attracting the pollinators that carry pollen between flowers."

When the male gamete from one parent fuses with the female gamete of another parent, the offspring receives a combination of genetic material from two genetically different parents. This mixing creates new combinations of traits, resulting in greater variation. In self-pollination, both the male and female gametes come from the same plant, so the genetic material is very similar and there is little variation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because wind is just one possible agent for cross-pollination and does not itself cause genetic mixing. Option C is incorrect because the flower size or seed count is not the reason for greater variation. Option D is wrong because self-pollination does involve pollen; the pollen just comes from the same flower or plant.
