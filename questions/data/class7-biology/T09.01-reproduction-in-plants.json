  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Reproduction is the process by which organisms produce new individuals of their own kind. Plants reproduce by two main methods: asexual (without seeds, involving one parent) and sexual (with seeds, involving two parents). Asexual reproduction includes budding, fragmentation, spore formation, and vegetative propagation (using plant parts like roots, stems, leaves). Vegetative propagation can be natural (runners, tubers, bulbs) or artificial (cutting, layering, grafting). Sexual reproduction in flowering plants involves the flower. A flower has sepals (protection), petals (attract pollinators), stamens (male part with anther and filament), and carpel (female part with stigma, style, ovary). Pollination transfers pollen from anther to stigma (self or cross). Fertilization occurs when male and female gametes fuse, forming a zygote that develops into a seed inside a fruit.",
    "rules": [
      "Asexual reproduction involves one parent and produces identical offspring",
      "Sexual reproduction involves two parents and produces varied offspring",
      "Vegetative propagation uses vegetative parts like roots, stems, leaves",
      "Flower has four whorls: sepals, petals, stamens, carpel",
      "Stamen = anther (pollen) + filament",
      "Carpel = stigma + style + ovary (with ovules)",
      "Self-pollination: pollen transfers within same flower or plant",
      "Cross-pollination: pollen transfers between different plants",
      "Fertilization produces zygote that develops into embryo in seed"

Reproduction is specifically the process of making new individuals of the same species, so that the species can continue on to the next generation."

      "explanation_correct": "When pollen is transferred within the same flower or to another flower on the same plant, it is called self-pollination. This is because the male and female parts of the flower are on the same plant, allowing the pollen to fertilize the ovule without having to travel to another plant.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is self-pollination. Cross-pollination occurs when pollen is transferred between different plants, while fertilization is the process of the male and female gametes fusing to form a zygote. Budding is a form of asexual reproduction, which does not involve pollination or fertilization."

This is because the stigma is the top part of the carpel that receives the pollen, the style is the narrow tube that connects the stigma to the ovary, and the ovary is the bottom part that contains the ovules that will develop into seeds after fertilization.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The order is not Ovary, Style, Stigma. The stigma is the topmost part of the carpel that receives the pollen, followed by the style which is the narrow tube connecting the stigma to the ovary, and the ovary is the bottommost part that contains the ovules. The order should be Stigma, Style, Ovary."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is: Zygote forms, Embryo develops, Seed germinates, New plant grows. This is the typical sequence of events in the reproduction of flowering plants. The zygote is formed when the male and female gametes fuse, which then develops into an embryo inside the seed. The seed then germinates, allowing the new plant to grow and mature.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order is: Seed germinates, Embryo develops, Zygote forms, New plant grows. This is not the correct sequence because the zygote, which is formed by the fusion of male and female gametes, must form first before the embryo can develop inside the seed. The seed then germinates, allowing the new plant to grow and mature."
