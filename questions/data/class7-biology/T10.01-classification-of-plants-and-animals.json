    "text": "Classification is the process of grouping organisms based on similarities and differences. It helps in systematic study and understanding relationships. The hierarchy of classification is: Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family, Genus, Species. Whittaker's Five Kingdom Classification divides organisms into Monera (bacteria), Protista (unicellular eukaryotes), Fungi (decomposers), Plantae (plants), and Animalia (animals). Plants are classified as Thallophyta (algae), Bryophyta (mosses), Pteridophyta (ferns), Gymnosperms (naked seeds), and Angiosperms (flowering plants with enclosed seeds). Angiosperms are divided into Monocots and Dicots. Animals are classified as Invertebrates (without backbone) and Vertebrates (with backbone). Vertebrates include Fish, Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves (birds), and Mammalia.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Amphibian eggs lack the protective shell that reptile and bird eggs have. Without a shell, the eggs would quickly dry out and die if laid on land. The water provides the moisture that the jelly-like eggs need to survive. This is why amphibians are still tied to water for reproduction, even though adults can live on land.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Amphibian eggs don't have a hard shell like reptile or bird eggs. They are soft and jelly-like, so they would dehydrate on land. Water provides the essential moisture for the eggs to develop. This is a key limitation that keeps amphibians partially dependent on aquatic environments."

A bat has hair/fur (not feathers), gives birth to live young (doesn't lay eggs), and feeds milk to its babies — all mammalian characteristics. Having wings and being able to fly doesn't make an animal a bird. Birds are identified by feathers, beaks, and egg-laying.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The student's reasoning is wrong because flying is not what defines a bird. Birds are defined by feathers, beaks, hollow bones, and egg-laying. Bats have none of these — they have hair, give live birth, and produce milk, making them mammals."

Reptiles lay hard-shelled eggs on land. Even some mammals (like the platypus) lay eggs! What makes birds unique is not egg-laying itself, but the combination of feathers, beaks, hollow bones, AND egg-laying.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Egg-laying is not unique to birds. Fish, amphibians, reptiles, and even some mammals (platypus) lay eggs. Birds are distinguished by their feathers, beaks, and hollow bones — not just by egg-laying."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Classification is based on the overall combination of features. Crocodiles have scaly skin, lay eggs, and are cold-blooded — these are reptilian features.

This allows them to remain active even in cold conditions — birds can fly in winter, and mammals can hunt at night when it's cold. Cold-blooded animals depend on external heat sources (like the sun), so they become sluggish in cold weather.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Warm-blooded animals can regulate their own body temperature, allowing them to stay active in varying conditions. This is the main advantage. Cold-blooded animals can still move, but they are less active in cold temperatures because their body processes slow down."
