    "text": "The environment includes all living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) components that surround an organism. Biotic components include producers (plants), consumers (animals), and decomposers (bacteria, fungi). Abiotic components include air, water, soil, temperature, and light. An ecosystem is a community of organisms interacting with each other and their physical environment. A habitat is the specific place where an organism lives. A food chain shows the transfer of energy from one organism to another, starting with producers. Interconnected food chains form a food web. Energy flows from producers to consumers and decreases at each level. Environmental pollution (air, water, soil) harms ecosystems. Conservation of biodiversity through national parks, sanctuaries, and sustainable practices is essential.",
    "rules": [
      "Biotic = living; Abiotic = non-living components",
      "Producers make food; consumers eat; decomposers break down dead matter",
      "Ecosystem = community + physical environment",
      "Food chain: Producer → Primary consumer → Secondary consumer → Tertiary consumer",
      "Food web = interconnected food chains",
      "Energy decreases at each trophic level",
