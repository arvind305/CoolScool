    "text": "The environment includes all living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) components that surround an organism. Biotic components include producers (plants), consumers (animals), and decomposers (bacteria, fungi). Abiotic components include air, water, soil, temperature, and light. An ecosystem is a community of organisms interacting with each other and their physical environment. A habitat is the specific place where an organism lives. A food chain shows the transfer of energy from one organism to another, starting with producers. Interconnected food chains form a food web. Energy flows from producers to consumers and decreases at each level. Environmental pollution (air, water, soil) harms ecosystems. Conservation of biodiversity through national parks, sanctuaries, and sustainable practices is essential.",

      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is: Producers absorb nutrients, Consumers eat producers, Decomposers break down dead matter, Nutrients return to soil. This shows the flow of matter in an ecosystem - producers use nutrients to make food, consumers eat the producers, and decomposers break down the dead matter to return the nutrients back to the soil for the producers to use again.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Consumers eat producers, Decomposers break down dead matter, Nutrients return to soil, Producers absorb nutrients. This is wrong because it skips the important step where producers (plants) first absorb the nutrients from the soil to make food. The correct order follows the flow of matter through the ecosystem, with producers, consumers, and decomposers playing their roles."
