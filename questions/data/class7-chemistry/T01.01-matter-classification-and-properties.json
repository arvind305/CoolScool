    "text": "Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. All objects around us, whether we can see them or not, are made of matter. Matter exists in three states: solid, liquid, and gas. Solids have definite shape and volume, liquids have definite volume but take the shape of their container, and gases have neither definite shape nor volume. Matter has physical properties (color, odor, hardness, density, melting point, boiling point) and chemical properties (reactivity, combustibility). Matter can change from one state to another through processes like melting, freezing, evaporation, condensation, and sublimation.",
