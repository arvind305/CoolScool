    "text": "Matter can be classified into pure substances and mixtures. Pure substances include elements and compounds. An element is the simplest form of matter that cannot be broken down into simpler substances. Elements are classified into metals (like iron, copper, gold) and non-metals (like carbon, sulfur, oxygen). Compounds are formed when two or more elements combine chemically in a fixed ratio. Mixtures are formed by physically mixing two or more substances. Mixtures can be homogeneous (uniform throughout) or heterogeneous (not uniform). Various methods like filtration, evaporation, and distillation are used to separate mixtures.",

      "Pure substances have fixed composition and properties",
      "Elements cannot be broken down into simpler substances",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is that pure substances have a fixed composition. This means the elements in a pure substance are always combined in the same ratio. Unlike mixtures, pure substances do not have variable compositions or multiple components - they are made up of only one type of substance."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is 'Heat liquid', 'Liquid evaporates', 'Cool vapors', 'Collect distillate'. This is because when you heat a liquid, it evaporates into a vapor. Then, the vapor is cooled, which turns it back into a liquid (the distillate), which is then collected.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be 'Cool vapors', 'Collect distillate', 'Heat liquid', 'Liquid evaporates'. This is wrong because you need to first heat the liquid to make it evaporate, then cool the vapor to make it condense into a liquid (the distillate), which can then be collected."
