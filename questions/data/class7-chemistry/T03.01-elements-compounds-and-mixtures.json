    "text": "Matter can be classified into pure substances and mixtures. Pure substances include elements and compounds. An element is the simplest form of matter that cannot be broken down into simpler substances. Elements are classified into metals (like iron, copper, gold) and non-metals (like carbon, sulfur, oxygen). Compounds are formed when two or more elements combine chemically in a fixed ratio. Mixtures are formed by physically mixing two or more substances. Mixtures can be homogeneous (uniform throughout) or heterogeneous (not uniform). Various methods like filtration, evaporation, and distillation are used to separate mixtures.",

      "Pure substances have fixed composition and properties",
      "Elements cannot be broken down into simpler substances",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is that pure substances have a fixed composition. This means the elements in a pure substance are always combined in the same ratio. Unlike mixtures, pure substances do not have variable compositions or multiple components - they are made up of only one type of substance."

      "explanation_correct": "Sugar is a compound made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. When heated strongly, it decomposes into carbon (the black residue) and water vapour. The fact that sugar can be broken down into simpler substances by a chemical process (heating) confirms it is a compound, not an element. Elements cannot be broken down further.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "An element cannot be broken down into simpler substances, but sugar clearly decomposed, so it is not an element. A mixture would separate into its components without chemical change, but here new substances (carbon and water) were formed. Turning black does not make something a metal. The decomposition into simpler substances through a chemical change proves sugar is a compound."

Although salt dissolved in water forms a homogeneous solution, the addition of sand (which does not dissolve) creates visibly different parts in the mixture. The sand settles at the bottom while the salt water remains as a liquid above it, making the overall mixture heterogeneous.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "It is not a pure substance because it contains multiple substances (water, salt, sand). Water is a compound, not an element. Salt dissolving in water is a physical process, not a chemical combination, so no new compound is formed. The visible sand particles make the mixture non-uniform, which is the defining feature of a heterogeneous mixture."

The dissolved salt passes right through the filter along with the water. Evaporation works because when the water is heated and turns to vapour, the salt is left behind as a solid residue.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The reason is not about weight or colour. Filtration can work with any colour of liquid, but it only traps insoluble solid particles that are large enough to be caught by filter paper. Dissolved salt particles are too small for this.
