    "text": "Changes in matter can be classified as physical or chemical changes. A physical change is a change in which no new substance is formed. The composition of the substance remains the same, only the physical properties like shape, size, or state may change. Examples include melting of ice, breaking of glass, and dissolving salt in water. A chemical change is a change in which a new substance is formed with different properties. Examples include rusting of iron, burning of paper, and cooking food. Chemical changes are usually accompanied by indicators like color change, gas evolution, temperature change, or formation of precipitate.",

      "explanation_correct": "Melting ice is the most reversible, as the ice can easily be refrozen back into its original solid form. Dissolving salt in water is also reversible, as the salt can be separated from the water by evaporation. Burning paper is the least reversible, as the paper is completely destroyed and a new substance (ash) is formed that cannot be easily turned back into paper.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Burning paper is not the most reversible change. When paper is burned, it undergoes a chemical reaction that creates new substances like ash and smoke that cannot be easily turned back into paper. Melting ice is the most reversible, as the water can be refrozen into ice. Dissolving salt in water is also reversible, as the salt can be separated from the water by evaporation."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order is 'Rust forms, Iron reacts with oxygen and water, Iron exposed to air'. This is wrong because rust cannot form without the iron first being exposed to air and then reacting with oxygen and water. The correct sequence is that the iron is exposed to air, then it reacts with oxygen and water, and finally the rust is formed as a new substance."
