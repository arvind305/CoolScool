    "text": "Changes in matter can be classified as physical or chemical changes. A physical change is a change in which no new substance is formed. The composition of the substance remains the same, only the physical properties like shape, size, or state may change. Examples include melting of ice, breaking of glass, and dissolving salt in water. A chemical change is a change in which a new substance is formed with different properties. Examples include rusting of iron, burning of paper, and cooking food. Chemical changes are usually accompanied by indicators like color change, gas evolution, temperature change, or formation of precipitate.",

During fermentation, microorganisms chemically break down the substances in the batter, producing new substances like carbon dioxide and organic acids.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because the batter's rise is caused by gas bubbles, not a simple change in shape. Option C is wrong because the scenario describes smell change and gas evolution, not a temperature change. Option D is wrong because the sour smell and bubbles are clear signs that new substances have been formed through fermentation, a chemical change."

The salt can be recovered by evaporating the water, proving that no chemical reaction took place.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A (burning a matchstick) is a chemical change because new substances like ash and gases are formed. Option C (cooking an egg) is a chemical change because the proteins in the egg permanently change their structure, forming new substances.

The original raw banana cannot be recovered from a ripe one.",

Students often assume that all physical changes are reversible, but this is a notable exception. Although the chemical composition of the glass does not change, you cannot easily join the broken pieces back into the original glass. In contrast, melting ice, dissolving salt, and evaporating water can all be easily reversed.",

Option C is wrong because dissolving salt is reversible — the salt can be recovered by evaporating the water. Option D is wrong because evaporation is reversible — water vapour can be condensed back into liquid water.

When a candle burns, the wax (a hydrocarbon) reacts with oxygen in the air to form carbon dioxide gas and water vapour — these are entirely new substances with properties completely different from wax. While the candle also undergoes physical changes (melting of wax, change in size), the reason it is classified as a chemical change is specifically because new substances are produced through a chemical reaction.",

Option B describes the physical change component (melting) — melting alone is a physical change. Option D describes energy changes that can accompany both physical and chemical changes — heat is also absorbed during melting of ice (a physical change).

Reversing this requires breaking those new bonds and reforming the original ones, which is usually very difficult or requires a completely separate reaction. In a physical change, the chemical composition of the substance remains unchanged — only the arrangement or state changes — so the original form can usually be restored by simply reversing the conditions (e.g., cooling a liquid to freeze it).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incomplete — while some chemical changes require energy, this is not the reason they are irreversible. Option C is wrong because not all chemical changes involve heat, and heat involvement does not explain irreversibility. Option D is factually incorrect — the speed of a change has nothing to do with its reversibility."
