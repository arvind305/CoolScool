    "text": "Acids are substances that taste sour and turn blue litmus red. Common acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and citric acid found in lemons. Bases are substances that taste bitter, feel soapy, and turn red litmus blue. Common bases include sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2). Indicators are substances that show different colors in acidic and basic solutions. Litmus is a common indicator - red litmus turns blue in bases, and blue litmus turns red in acids. When an acid reacts with a base, they neutralize each other to form salt and water. This is called a neutralization reaction.",

When Meera mixed them, the acid and base neutralized each other. The litmus paper showed no color change because the resulting solution was neutral — this confirms that a neutralization reaction took place.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Methyl orange turns red in acids (not bases) and yellow in bases (not acids). So A must be acidic and B must be basic. When the two were mixed, the acid and base reacted in a neutralization reaction to form a neutral solution. This is confirmed by the litmus paper showing no change, which indicates a neutral solution. Both cannot be neutral or both acidic, as methyl orange showed different colors."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Calamine is not acidic — it is basic (contains zinc carbonate). It does not work by cooling the skin through evaporation or by dissolving venom in water.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The reason is not about cost, availability, or physical form. Litmus is actually a natural indicator obtained from lichens, not a synthetic one.
