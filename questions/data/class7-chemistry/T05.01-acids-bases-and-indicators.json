    "text": "Acids are substances that taste sour and turn blue litmus red. Common acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4), and citric acid found in lemons. Bases are substances that taste bitter, feel soapy, and turn red litmus blue. Common bases include sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)2). Indicators are substances that show different colors in acidic and basic solutions. Litmus is a common indicator - red litmus turns blue in bases, and blue litmus turns red in acids. When an acid reacts with a base, they neutralize each other to form salt and water. This is called a neutralization reaction.",

      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is 'Acidity develops, Antacid neutralizes acid, Relief obtained' because acidity first occurs, then the antacid reacts with and neutralizes the acid, which finally leads to relief from the acidity.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be 'Relief obtained, Acidity develops, Antacid neutralizes acid'. This is not correct because acidity has to develop first before the antacid can neutralize it, and only after the neutralization will relief be obtained. The steps must go in the order of acidity developing, then the antacid reacting with and neutralizing the acid, and finally the relief being obtained."
