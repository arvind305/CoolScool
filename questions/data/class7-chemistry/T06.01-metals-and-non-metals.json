    "text": "Elements are classified into metals and non-metals based on their properties. Metals are lustrous (shiny), malleable (can be beaten into sheets), ductile (can be drawn into wires), and good conductors of heat and electricity. Examples include iron, copper, gold, and silver. Non-metals are generally dull, brittle, and poor conductors. Examples include carbon, sulfur, and oxygen. There are some exceptions: mercury is a liquid metal, graphite (a form of carbon) conducts electricity. Metals react with oxygen to form metal oxides, with water to form hydroxides, and with acids to form salts and hydrogen gas.",

This makes sense because first the iron is exposed to air and moisture, then it reacts with the oxygen and water to form rust, which is the final step in the rusting process.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: 'Rust forms' -> 'Iron exposed to air and moisture' -> 'Iron reacts with oxygen and water'. This is wrong because rust cannot form first - the iron needs to be exposed to air and moisture, and then it must react with oxygen and water to produce rust, which is the final step in the process."
