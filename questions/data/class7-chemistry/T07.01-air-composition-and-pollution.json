    "text": "Air is a mixture of gases that surrounds the Earth. The main components of air are nitrogen (about 78%), oxygen (about 21%), and other gases (about 1%) including carbon dioxide, water vapor, and noble gases. Oxygen supports combustion and is essential for respiration. Nitrogen does not support combustion and is used in food packaging. Carbon dioxide turns lime water milky and is used in fire extinguishers. Air pollution is the addition of harmful substances to air. Pollutants include carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. Sources of pollution include vehicles, industries, and burning of fuels. Effects include respiratory diseases, acid rain, and global warming. Prevention involves using clean fuels, planting trees, and reducing emissions.",

      "explanation_correct": "The corroded buildings and peeling paint near the factory area are caused by acid rain. Factories release sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides into the air. These gases dissolve in rain water to form sulfuric acid and nitric acid, making the rain acidic. This acid rain damages buildings, monuments, and plants.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Normal rain does not corrode buildings or peel paint. Global warming raises temperatures but does not directly corrode building surfaces. Smog affects visibility and breathing but does not cause the chemical corrosion described. The damage Rohan observed is specifically caused by acid rain, which forms when factory pollutants like SO2 and nitrogen oxides react with rain water."

Carbon dioxide does not turn into water. The correct explanation is that air contains water vapour, and when the air is cooled, this water vapour condenses into visible water droplets."

However, the oxygen in CO2 is chemically bonded to carbon and is not available to support burning.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Oxygen supports combustion. Air contains about 21% oxygen, so it also supports combustion. Oxygen-enriched air has even more oxygen and strongly supports combustion. Only pure carbon dioxide does not support combustion because its oxygen atoms are tightly bonded to carbon and cannot help things burn."

Once the oxygen is used up, combustion cannot continue, and the candle goes out. This demonstrates that oxygen is essential for combustion.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Blocking sunlight does not extinguish a candle since candles burn using their own fuel and oxygen, not sunlight. Wax melting faster does not extinguish the flame. Nitrogen does not actively put out flames; it simply does not support combustion. The real reason is that the oxygen inside the jar gets used up, stopping combustion."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Carbon monoxide does not have a strong smell; it is actually odourless, which is part of what makes it so dangerous. It does not cause acid rain (that is caused by sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides). It is also not the most abundant gas released by factories. Its real danger lies in being undetectable by senses and its ability to poison blood by binding to haemoglobin."
