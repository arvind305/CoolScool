    "text": "Air is a mixture of gases that surrounds the Earth. The main components of air are nitrogen (about 78%), oxygen (about 21%), and other gases (about 1%) including carbon dioxide, water vapor, and noble gases. Oxygen supports combustion and is essential for respiration. Nitrogen does not support combustion and is used in food packaging. Carbon dioxide turns lime water milky and is used in fire extinguishers. Air pollution is the addition of harmful substances to air. Pollutants include carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. Sources of pollution include vehicles, industries, and burning of fuels. Effects include respiratory diseases, acid rain, and global warming. Prevention involves using clean fuels, planting trees, and reducing emissions.",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is 'Prepare lime water', 'CO2 passed through lime water', 'Lime water turns milky' because this is the sequence of steps in the lime water test. First, you need to prepare the lime water, then pass carbon dioxide (CO2) through it, and finally the lime water will turn milky, indicating the presence of CO2.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be 'Lime water turns milky', 'CO2 passed through lime water', 'Prepare lime water'. This is wrong because you need to first prepare the lime water, then pass CO2 through it, and only then will the lime water turn milky. The milky appearance is the result of the reaction between CO2 and lime water, so it cannot happen before the other steps."

This is not correct because recycling should be the last step, after we have tried to reduce the amount of waste we create and reuse items as much as we can.
