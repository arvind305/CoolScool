    "text": "Water is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless liquid that is essential for all life. It has unique physical properties: boiling point of 100 degrees Celsius and freezing point of 0 degrees Celsius at normal pressure. Water is called the universal solvent because it can dissolve many substances. A solution is a homogeneous mixture of a solute (substance that dissolves) and a solvent (substance in which solute dissolves). Solutions can be unsaturated (can dissolve more solute), saturated (cannot dissolve more solute), or supersaturated. Suspensions are mixtures where particles do not dissolve and settle down on standing. The water cycle involves evaporation, condensation, and precipitation, maintaining water on Earth.",

      "explanation_correct": "Soil particles are insoluble in water, meaning they do not dissolve and instead remain as visible particles that can be washed away. Soap, on the other hand, is soluble in water and dissolves to form a lather. This is why Rohan sees the soil not dissolving but the soap mixing well with water.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Soap dissolves in water to create lather, so it is soluble. Soil particles are made of minerals and organic matter that do not dissolve in water, making them insoluble. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they wrongly describe the solubility of either soil or soap in water."

The water molecules arrange themselves in an open crystalline structure that occupies more volume than liquid water. Since the bottle was completely full, the expanding ice had no room and exerted pressure on the glass, causing it to crack.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Water does not become denser when it freezes -- it becomes less dense, which is why ice floats. Water does not evaporate in a freezer because the temperature is too low. Water also does not dissolve glass. The correct explanation is that water expands upon freezing due to the open crystal structure of ice, and this expansion cracked the bottle."

The sugar that was already dissolved is now below the maximum capacity at the new temperature.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because the saturation of a solution depends on temperature. When temperature increases, solubility increases for most solid solutes.

When water freezes into ice, its molecules form an open crystalline structure that takes up more volume, making ice less dense than liquid water. This is why ice floats on water, which is an unusual and important property.",

Option C is incorrect because most solids sink in their own liquid; ice floating on water is the exception. Option D is wrong because density does change with state changes.

      "explanation_correct": "Water has a high boiling point because of the strong hydrogen bonds between water molecules. These attractive forces hold the molecules together tightly, so more energy (higher temperature) is needed to break them apart and convert liquid water into steam. This is why water boils at 100 degrees Celsius, which is higher than many other liquids of similar molecular size.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Water being colourless or tasteless has nothing to do with its boiling point. The abundance of water on Earth does not affect its boiling point either. Pure water does not contain dissolved salts. The real reason is the strong hydrogen bonds between water molecules, which require more heat energy to overcome, giving water its relatively high boiling point."

Without stirring, the water nearest to the solute quickly becomes saturated, slowing down dissolving. Stirring ensures that less concentrated water continuously reaches the solute, speeding up the process.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Stirring does not significantly heat up the water, change the chemical nature of the solute, or remove impurities from the water.

Higher temperature gives water molecules more energy to escape from the liquid surface as vapor. Wind blows away the water vapor near the clothes, preventing the air from becoming saturated with moisture, which allows more water to evaporate quickly.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Wind does not physically push water out of clothes. The sun does not dissolve water -- it provides heat energy for evaporation. Condensation is the opposite of evaporation and would make clothes wetter, not drier.
