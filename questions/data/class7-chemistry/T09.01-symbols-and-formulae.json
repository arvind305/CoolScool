    "text": "Chemical symbols are one or two letter representations of elements. The first letter is always capital, and if there is a second letter, it is always small. Some elements have symbols derived from their Latin names: Fe (Ferrum) for Iron, Cu (Cuprum) for Copper, Ag (Argentum) for Silver. Valency is the combining capacity of an element - it tells us how many atoms of hydrogen an element can combine with or replace. Hydrogen has valency 1, oxygen has valency 2, nitrogen has valency 3, and carbon has valency 4. Chemical formulas show the types and numbers of atoms in a compound. The subscript number indicates how many atoms of that element are present. For example, H2O means 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom.",

A chemical symbol is a short one or two letter code that represents a specific element, like H for hydrogen or C for carbon.
