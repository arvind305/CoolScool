    "text": "Chemical symbols are one or two letter representations of elements. The first letter is always capital, and if there is a second letter, it is always small. Some elements have symbols derived from their Latin names: Fe (Ferrum) for Iron, Cu (Cuprum) for Copper, Ag (Argentum) for Silver. Valency is the combining capacity of an element - it tells us how many atoms of hydrogen an element can combine with or replace. Hydrogen has valency 1, oxygen has valency 2, nitrogen has valency 3, and carbon has valency 4. Chemical formulas show the types and numbers of atoms in a compound. The subscript number indicates how many atoms of that element are present. For example, H2O means 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom.",

A chemical symbol is a short one or two letter code that represents a specific element, like H for hydrogen or C for carbon.

      "explanation_correct": "The symbol Fe for iron comes from its Latin name 'Ferrum'. Many elements that were known in ancient times have symbols derived from their Latin names, not their English names. That is why Fe does not start with I.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "While iodine (I) and iridium (Ir) also exist, the primary reason Fe is used for iron is that the symbol comes from the Latin name 'Ferrum'. Iron does have an English name, and scientists did not make a mistake. Using Latin names for symbols is a deliberate convention in chemistry."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Water is H2O because hydrogen has valency 1 and oxygen has valency 2. To balance the combining capacities, you need 2 hydrogen atoms (each with valency 1, total = 2) to combine with 1 oxygen atom (valency 2). This gives the formula H2O.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The formula is not random or just an ordering convention. It is based on valency. Hydrogen (valency 1) needs 2 atoms to match oxygen's valency of 2. So 2 hydrogens combine with 1 oxygen, giving H2O. HO2 would mean 1 hydrogen and 2 oxygen, which does not balance the valencies."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Nitrogen has a valency of 3, meaning it can combine with 3 atoms of hydrogen. Since hydrogen has valency 1, three hydrogen atoms are needed to match nitrogen's combining capacity of 3. This gives the formula NH3 (1 nitrogen + 3 hydrogen).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The formula NH3 does not mean 3 nitrogen atoms or 3 molecules of hydrogen. Hydrogen has valency 1, not 3. The subscript 3 refers to 3 atoms of hydrogen. Nitrogen's valency of 3 requires 3 hydrogen atoms to fully combine, which is why the formula is NH3."
