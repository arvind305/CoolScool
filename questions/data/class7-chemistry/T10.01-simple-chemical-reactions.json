    "text": "A chemical reaction is a process in which one or more substances (reactants) are converted into one or more new substances (products) with different properties. Chemical reactions can be represented using word equations, where the names of reactants are written on the left side and products on the right side, separated by an arrow. Combination reactions involve two or more substances combining to form a single product (A + B gives AB). Decomposition reactions involve a single substance breaking down into two or more simpler substances (AB gives A + B). Reactions that release heat are called exothermic reactions (like burning), while reactions that absorb heat are called endothermic reactions (like photosynthesis).",

        "Single compound heated",

      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is 'Single compound heated, Bonds break, Simpler products formed' because in a decomposition reaction, a single compound is first heated. This heat energy causes the chemical bonds in the compound to break, which then leads to the formation of two or more simpler products.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order is 'Simpler products formed, Single compound heated, Bonds break'. This is not the correct sequence because the bonds in the compound must first break due to the heat energy, which then allows the formation of simpler products. The heating of the single compound is the first step that initiates the decomposition reaction."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The order from releasing most heat to absorbing heat is: Burning fuel, Dissolving ammonium chloride, Photosynthesis. Burning fuel releases a lot of heat, making it an exothermic reaction. Dissolving ammonium chloride in water is also an endothermic reaction, where some heat is absorbed. However, photosynthesis is the process where plants absorb sunlight and use it to make their own food, which is the most endothermic of the three reactions."

This is because when heat is applied to food, it triggers a chemical reaction that causes the food to change its properties and form new substances, which results in the final cooked product.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: New substances formed, Heat applied, Chemical reaction occurs, Food changes properties. This is wrong because the chemical reaction must happen first, before new substances are formed and the food changes its properties. The heat must be applied to start the chemical reaction, which then leads to the formation of new substances and the changed properties of the food."
