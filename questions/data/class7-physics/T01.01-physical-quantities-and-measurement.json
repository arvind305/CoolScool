    "text": "Physical quantities are quantities that can be measured. They are of two types: fundamental quantities (length, mass, time) and derived quantities (area, volume, speed). The International System of Units (SI) provides standard units for measurement. The SI unit of length is metre (m), mass is kilogram (kg), and time is second (s). Various instruments are used for measurement: metre scale for length, physical balance for mass, spring balance for weight, measuring cylinder for volume, and stopwatch for time. The least count of an instrument is the smallest measurement it can accurately make.",

        "Calculate the difference in water levels"
      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The correct order of steps is important to accurately measure the volume of an irregular solid using water displacement. First, you need to pour water into a measuring cylinder and note the initial water level. Then, you gently drop the solid into the water, which causes the water level to rise. You need to note this new water level. Finally, you can calculate the difference in the two water levels, which gives you the volume of the solid.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order of steps would be less effective in measuring the volume of an irregular solid. For example, if you first drop the solid into the water and then pour water into the measuring cylinder, you won't have the initial water level to compare with. Similarly, if you calculate the difference in water levels without first noting the new water level, you won't be able to determine the volume accurately."

      "explanation_correct": "The answer is correct because the lengths are arranged in increasing order. 50 mm is the smallest length, followed by 500 cm, then 5 m, and finally 0.5 km, which is the largest length.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The lengths are not in the correct order. 50 mm is smaller than 500 cm, which is 5 meters. 5 meters is smaller than 0.5 kilometers, which is 500 meters. The correct order from smallest to largest is: 50 mm, 500 cm, 5 m, 0.5 km."
