    "text": "Physical quantities are quantities that can be measured. They are of two types: fundamental quantities (length, mass, time) and derived quantities (area, volume, speed). The International System of Units (SI) provides standard units for measurement. The SI unit of length is metre (m), mass is kilogram (kg), and time is second (s). Various instruments are used for measurement: metre scale for length, physical balance for mass, spring balance for weight, measuring cylinder for volume, and stopwatch for time. The least count of an instrument is the smallest measurement it can accurately make.",
