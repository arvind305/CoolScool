    "text": "Motion is the change in position of an object with respect to its surroundings over time. An object at rest does not change its position. Motion can be of different types: rectilinear (straight line), circular, rotational, and oscillatory. Speed is the distance covered per unit time, measured in metres per second (m/s). Velocity is speed in a particular direction. Uniform motion means equal distances are covered in equal time intervals, while non-uniform motion means unequal distances in equal time intervals. Distance-time graphs help visualize motion - a straight line indicates uniform motion.",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order to calculate speed is: 1) Measure the distance covered, 2) Note the time taken, 3) Divide the distance by the time, and 4) Write the unit of speed (m/s). This is the logical sequence to find speed, which is the distance covered per unit of time.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to first divide the distance by time, then note the time taken, and finally write the unit of speed. This is not correct because you need to first measure the distance and note the time before you can calculate the speed by dividing the two values. The unit of speed should be written at the end as the final step."

Rectilinear motion is the easiest to understand as the object moves in a straight line. Circular motion is more complex as the object follows a curved path. Random motion is the most complex as the object moves in an unpredictable, irregular way without a set pattern."

The car travels a greater distance at 60 km/h, and the train covers the most distance in 1 hour with a speed of 100 km/h.
