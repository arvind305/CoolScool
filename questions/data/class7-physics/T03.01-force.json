    "text": "Force is a push or pull that can change the state of motion, direction, or shape of an object. Forces can be contact forces (like friction, muscular force) or non-contact forces (like gravity, magnetic force, electrostatic force). Friction is a force that opposes motion between two surfaces in contact. Friction can be static, sliding, or rolling. While friction causes wear and tear, it is also essential for walking, writing, and braking. Balanced forces result in no change in motion, while unbalanced forces cause acceleration or deceleration.",

Balanced forces are when two forces acting on an object are equal in size and opposite in direction, like pushing and pulling an object with the same amount of force.

The downward force of gravity (weight) is balanced by the upward force of the table, so the net force on the book is zero. This means the book remains stationary and does not accelerate.",

Gravity is still pulling down on the book, but the table is pushing up with an equal force. The forces are balanced, so the book stays in place.

      "explanation_correct": "The friction between two surfaces depends on the roughness of the surfaces. Sandpaper has the highest friction, followed by rough concrete, smooth glass, and ice surface which has the lowest friction. This is because the rougher the surface, the more the interlocking of the surfaces, leading to higher friction.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to arrange the surfaces from lowest friction to highest friction. This is because the smoother the surface, the lower the friction. Ice surface has the lowest friction, followed by smooth glass, rough concrete, and sandpaper which has the highest friction. The reason for this order is that the rougher the surface, the more the interlocking of the surfaces, leading to higher friction."

      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The given forces can be arranged as contact forces (Friction, Muscular force) and non-contact forces (Gravitational force, Magnetic force). Friction and muscular force are contact forces because they act between two surfaces or objects in direct physical contact, while gravitational and magnetic forces can act without any physical contact.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect arrangement would be to mix up the contact and non-contact forces. For example, placing the gravitational force (a non-contact force) before the friction force (a contact force) would be wrong. The correct order is to first list the contact forces (Friction, Muscular force) followed by the non-contact forces (Gravitational force, Magnetic force)."
