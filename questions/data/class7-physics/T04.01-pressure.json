    "text": "Pressure is defined as force per unit area. When the same force is applied over a smaller area, pressure increases. The SI unit of pressure is Pascal (Pa). Pressure in liquids increases with depth and acts equally in all directions at a point. Atmospheric pressure is the pressure exerted by air on all surfaces. Evidence of atmospheric pressure includes phenomena like drinking through a straw and suction cups sticking to surfaces. Pressure concepts explain many everyday observations like why sharp knives cut better and why buildings need broad foundations.",

        "Wide flat base",
        "Normal base",
        "Pointed tip"
      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The wide flat base has the largest surface area, so the same force is distributed over a larger area, resulting in lower pressure on the ground. The pointed tip has the smallest surface area, so the same force is concentrated on a smaller area, resulting in higher pressure on the ground. The normal base is in between the wide flat base and pointed tip in terms of surface area and pressure.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The pointed tip does not actually exert the highest pressure on the ground. Even though it has the smallest surface area, the force applied is also likely to be smaller for a pointed object compared to a wider base. The wide flat base has the largest surface area, so it exerts the lowest pressure on the ground, while the normal base is in the middle."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to first write the unit of Pascal, then divide the force by the area. This does not make sense, as you need to measure the force and area first before you can calculate the pressure and write the unit. The correct order is to first measure the inputs (force and area), then perform the calculation, and finally write the unit."
