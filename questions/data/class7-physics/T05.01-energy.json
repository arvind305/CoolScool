It exists in many forms including kinetic energy (energy of motion), potential energy (stored energy due to position), heat, light, sound, chemical, electrical, and nuclear energy. Energy can be transformed from one form to another but cannot be created or destroyed - this is the law of conservation of energy. Energy sources are classified as renewable (solar, wind, hydro) or non-renewable (coal, petroleum, natural gas). The SI unit of energy is Joule (J).",

      "explanation_correct": "Solar energy and wind energy are the most sustainable energy sources because they are renewable - they can be harnessed endlessly without getting used up. Natural gas is also renewable but it takes longer to replenish than solar and wind. Coal is the least sustainable because it is a non-renewable fossil fuel that will eventually run out.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Coal is not the most sustainable energy source because it is a non-renewable fossil fuel that takes millions of years to form. Natural gas is more sustainable than coal but it is still a fossil fuel that will eventually get used up. Solar energy and wind energy are the most sustainable options because they are renewable and can be harnessed indefinitely."

        "Motor converts energy",
        "Fan blades rotate (kinetic)",
        "Air moves (kinetic)"
      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is Electrical energy flows, Motor converts energy, Fan blades rotate (kinetic), Air moves (kinetic). This is because when you switch on the fan, first the electrical energy flows from the power source to the motor. The motor then converts this electrical energy into mechanical energy, which makes the fan blades rotate. This rotating motion of the fan blades then causes the air to move, creating a flow of air.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be something like Fan blades rotate (kinetic), Electrical energy flows, Motor converts energy, Air moves (kinetic). This is wrong because the fan blades cannot start rotating before the electrical energy has reached the motor and been converted into mechanical energy. The correct order is Electrical energy flows first, then the motor converts this energy, which makes the fan blades rotate, and finally the rotating fan blades cause the air to move."
