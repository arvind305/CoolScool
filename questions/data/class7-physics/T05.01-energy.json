It exists in many forms including kinetic energy (energy of motion), potential energy (stored energy due to position), heat, light, sound, chemical, electrical, and nuclear energy. Energy can be transformed from one form to another but cannot be created or destroyed - this is the law of conservation of energy. Energy sources are classified as renewable (solar, wind, hydro) or non-renewable (coal, petroleum, natural gas). The SI unit of energy is Joule (J).",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is: Ball has KE when thrown, Ball has maximum PE at top, Ball gains KE while falling, Ball hits ground with KE. This is because the ball starts with kinetic energy when thrown, then as it rises, its kinetic energy decreases and potential energy increases until it reaches the maximum height. On the way down, the potential energy is converted back to kinetic energy.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Ball has maximum PE at top, Ball has KE when thrown, Ball gains KE while falling, Ball hits ground with KE. This is wrong because the ball needs to have kinetic energy first in order to gain potential energy as it rises.

The heat energy warms the vessel and the water, while the light energy is visible as the blue flame. This is a transformation of chemical energy into heat and light.",

The molecules of the ball have chemical energy in their bonds, and the ball has heat energy (internal energy) due to its temperature. Energy exists in many forms beyond just kinetic and potential.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A reinforces the misconception. Option C is wrong because the ball does not currently possess sound energy -- sound is only produced when a vibrating object creates sound waves. Option D is incorrect because the ball reflects light but does not store light energy itself; it is the light source that has the energy."

When we 'use' energy, it does not disappear. Instead, it is transformed from one form into other forms. For example, when a car burns fuel, the chemical energy is converted into heat and kinetic energy. The energy is still present, just in different forms.",

At the highest point, all kinetic energy has been transformed into potential energy and the ball momentarily stops. Gravity then pulls the ball downward, converting the potential energy back into kinetic energy. The ball returns because gravity acts on it, and the energy transformation between potential and kinetic forms allows this back-and-forth motion.",
