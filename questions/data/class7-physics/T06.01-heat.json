    "text": "Heat is a form of energy that flows from a hot body to a cold body. Temperature is the measure of the degree of hotness or coldness of a body. Heat is measured in Joules while temperature is measured in degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit. Heat can be transferred by three modes: conduction (through solids without particle movement), convection (through fluids with particle movement), and radiation (without any medium). Metals are good conductors while wood, plastic, and air are bad conductors (insulators). Understanding heat transfer explains many phenomena like sea breeze, land breeze, and cooking.",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order of the steps for sea breeze formation is: The Sun heats the land and sea, the land heats up faster than the sea, the hot air over the land rises, and then the cool air from the sea moves towards the land. This is because the land heats up faster than the sea, causing the hot air over the land to rise, creating an area of low pressure that draws in the cooler air from the sea.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Cool air from sea moves towards land, Sun heats the land and sea, Hot air over land rises, Land heats up faster than sea. This is wrong because the first step should be the Sun heating the land and sea, which causes the land to heat up faster than the sea, leading to the hot air over the land rising and the cooler air from the sea moving towards the land."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: One end of the rod is heated, Energy passes to neighbouring particles, Particles at heated end vibrate faster, Other end becomes hot. This is wrong because the particles at the heated end need to vibrate faster first before the energy can pass to the neighboring particles, which then makes the other end of the rod become hot."
