    "text": "Light is a form of energy that enables us to see objects. Light travels in straight lines (rectilinear propagation). Objects that produce their own light are called luminous objects (sun, stars, bulb), while those that don't are non-luminous (moon, planets). Materials can be transparent (allow all light), translucent (allow some light), or opaque (block light). Reflection is the bouncing back of light from a surface. The laws of reflection state that the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection, and the incident ray, reflected ray, and normal lie in the same plane. Plane mirrors form virtual, erect, same-size, laterally inverted images.",
