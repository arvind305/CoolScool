    "text": "Sound is produced by vibrating objects. It requires a medium (solid, liquid, or gas) to travel and cannot travel through vacuum. Sound travels fastest in solids and slowest in gases. The characteristics of sound include loudness (depends on amplitude), pitch (depends on frequency), and quality or timbre (distinguishes different sources). An echo is the reflection of sound from a hard surface. For an echo to be heard distinctly, the reflecting surface must be at least 17 metres away. Noise pollution is unwanted sound that can be harmful to health.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Sound is produced by vibrating objects because the vibrations create pressure waves in the surrounding medium, which we perceive as sound. When an object vibrates, it causes the nearby air molecules to also vibrate, and this disturbance travels through the air as a sound wave.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Sound is not produced by stationary, hot, or cold objects. These objects do not create the necessary vibrations to generate sound waves. Only vibrating objects, like a guitar string or a speaker membrane, can produce sound that we can hear."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct answer is C) 17 metres away. For an echo to be heard distinctly, the reflecting surface must be at least 17 metres away. This is because it takes some time for the sound to travel to the reflecting surface and come back to the listener. If the surface is too close, the echo will not be clearly heard.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is C) 17 metres away. Options A) 5 metres and B) 10 metres are too close for an echo to be heard clearly. The sound needs to travel a certain distance and come back for the echo to be distinct. Option D) 100 metres is too far, and the echo may not be as strong. So the ideal distance for hearing a clear echo is 17 metres or more."

This is because sound travels through the air, reflects off a hard surface, and then the reflected sound waves reach our ears, allowing us to hear the echo.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect sequence would be: We hear the echo, Sound reflects back, We produce a sound, Sound reaches a hard surface. This is wrong because the echo can only be heard after the sound has been produced, traveled to a hard surface, and then reflected back to our ears. The sequence of events must start with producing the original sound."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Child's voice, Man's voice, Lion's roar, Mosquito's buzz. This is incorrect because the pitch of a sound depends on its frequency, and higher-pitched sounds have a higher frequency. The mosquito's buzz has the highest frequency, followed by the child's voice, the man's voice, and the lion's roar, which has the lowest frequency."
