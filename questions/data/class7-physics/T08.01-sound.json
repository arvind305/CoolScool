    "text": "Sound is produced by vibrating objects. It requires a medium (solid, liquid, or gas) to travel and cannot travel through vacuum. Sound travels fastest in solids and slowest in gases. The characteristics of sound include loudness (depends on amplitude), pitch (depends on frequency), and quality or timbre (distinguishes different sources). An echo is the reflection of sound from a hard surface. For an echo to be heard distinctly, the reflecting surface must be at least 17 metres away. Noise pollution is unwanted sound that can be harmful to health.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Sound is produced by vibrating objects because the vibrations create pressure waves in the surrounding medium, which we perceive as sound. When an object vibrates, it causes the nearby air molecules to also vibrate, and this disturbance travels through the air as a sound wave.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Sound is not produced by stationary, hot, or cold objects. These objects do not create the necessary vibrations to generate sound waves. Only vibrating objects, like a guitar string or a speaker membrane, can produce sound that we can hear."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct answer is C) 17 metres away. For an echo to be heard distinctly, the reflecting surface must be at least 17 metres away. This is because it takes some time for the sound to travel to the reflecting surface and come back to the listener. If the surface is too close, the echo will not be clearly heard.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is C) 17 metres away. Options A) 5 metres and B) 10 metres are too close for an echo to be heard clearly. The sound needs to travel a certain distance and come back for the echo to be distinct. Option D) 100 metres is too far, and the echo may not be as strong. So the ideal distance for hearing a clear echo is 17 metres or more."

      "explanation_correct": "Priya is experiencing an echo. The sound of her clap travels to the hard concrete wall 30 metres away and reflects back to her. Since 30 metres is more than the minimum 17 metres needed for a distinct echo, she hears the reflected sound after a brief delay.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The wall does not produce its own sound — it only reflects the sound back. This is not noise pollution, which refers to unwanted harmful sounds from sources like traffic or factories. The corridor does not make sound travel faster. The correct explanation is that sound reflects off the hard wall and returns to Priya as an echo."

After the mallet is pulled away, the bell continues to make sound for several seconds. Rohan then touches the bell with his hand and the sound stops immediately. Why does the sound stop when Rohan touches the bell?",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "When Rohan touches the vibrating bell, his hand provides a damping force that stops the bell from vibrating. Since sound is produced by the vibration of objects, when the vibration stops, sound production also stops. The bell was still vibrating after the mallet was pulled away, but Rohan's touch stopped those vibrations.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Rohan's hand does not absorb sound waves from the air — it physically stops the bell from vibrating. Temperature has nothing to do with it. Pitch cannot become zero in this way. The fundamental reason is that sound requires vibration, and when Rohan's hand stops the bell from vibrating, no more sound is produced."

      "explanation_correct": "Although both sounds are equally loud (same amplitude), they have different pitches. Thunder produces a deep, low-pitched sound with low frequency, while a whistle produces a high-pitched sound with high frequency. Meera tells them apart based on pitch, which depends on the frequency of vibration.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The question states both sounds are equally loud, so amplitude is the same and is not the distinguishing factor. Both sounds travel through the same medium (air) at the same speed. The key difference is pitch — thunder has a low frequency (low pitch) and the whistle has a high frequency (high pitch), which is how Meera distinguishes them."

Pitch depends on frequency, and factors like the tightness (tension) and length of a vibrating string affect the frequency. Many students confuse amplitude with pitch, but amplitude only controls how loud or soft a sound is, not how high or low it sounds.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Frequency directly determines pitch. Tightness of a string changes its frequency (tighter = higher frequency = higher pitch). Length of a string also affects frequency (shorter = higher frequency). Amplitude, however, only affects loudness — it has nothing to do with pitch. This is a common misconception among students."

      "explanation_incorrect": "A wooden door, lake water, and carbon dioxide are all media that contain particles and can transmit sound vibrations.

The reason is the mechanical vibration disturbing the medium.",

When one particle vibrates, it quickly passes the vibration to the next particle. This tight packing and strong bonding allows vibrations to transfer much more rapidly through steel compared to water, where particles are further apart and bonds are weaker.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Weight or heaviness alone does not determine the speed of sound. Electrical conductivity is unrelated to sound transmission. Steel actually has more particles packed per unit volume than water, not fewer. The correct reason is that the closely packed particles and strong bonds in steel allow vibrations to transfer from one particle to the next very quickly."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The purpose is not decoration, increasing loudness, or changing the speed of sound. Soft materials actually reduce sound reflection.
