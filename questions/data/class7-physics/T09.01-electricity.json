    "text": "Electric current is the flow of electric charges (electrons) through a conductor. For current to flow, a complete (closed) circuit is needed. A circuit consists of components like cell/battery (source), wires (conductors), switch (control), and load (like bulb). Conductors allow current to flow (metals like copper, aluminium), while insulators resist current flow (rubber, plastic, wood). Electric current has three main effects: heating effect (heater, bulb), magnetic effect (electromagnet), and chemical effect (electroplating). Standard symbols are used to draw circuit diagrams.",

A closed circuit has a complete path for the electric charges (electrons) to move through, allowing the current to flow continuously. An open circuit, on the other hand, has a break in the path, so the current cannot flow.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "An open circuit does not allow electric current to flow because there is a break in the path. The charges cannot complete the circuit and flow continuously.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation_correct": "When one bulb breaks in a series circuit, it creates a gap in the path. This breaks the complete circuit and makes it open, so current cannot flow to any of the other bulbs. This is why all the Diwali lights stop working when just one bulb breaks — the circuit becomes open and no current flows through any part of it.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "If only the battery had run out, all bulbs would dim gradually, not stop suddenly when one breaks. Thin wires would not cause all bulbs to stop when one breaks. A broken switch would stop all lights regardless of the bulbs being fine. The correct explanation is that the broken bulb creates a gap, opening the circuit and stopping all current flow."

When Rohan slides it forward (ON), the switch closes the circuit, creating a complete path for current to flow from the batteries through the bulb and back. When he slides it back (OFF), the switch opens the circuit, breaking the path and stopping the current, so the bulb turns off.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "A switch does not increase brightness — it only turns the circuit on or off. It does not charge the battery — batteries are charged by external chargers. It does not store electricity — that is the job of the battery. The switch simply opens or closes the circuit to control whether current flows."

However, tap water contains dissolved salts, minerals, and impurities that break into ions. These ions are charged particles that can carry electric current through the water. This is why tap water conducts electricity but pure water does not — the dissolved substances provide the free charges needed for current flow.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Temperature does not turn an insulator into a conductor in this case. Having more oxygen does not make water a conductor. The speed of water flow has nothing to do with electrical conductivity.

This is an exception to the general rule that metals are good conductors — the condition of the metal matters.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "A copper wire, a clean iron nail, and a silver coin are all good conductors because their metal surfaces are exposed and can carry current.

This reduces the total electrical energy available and the bulb may glow dimmer or not at all, even with more cells. For cells to increase brightness, they must all be connected correctly with the positive terminal of one cell joined to the negative terminal of the next.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "When cells are connected correctly (positive to negative), adding more cells does increase the current and the bulb glows brighter.

The bulb goes off because the circuit is broken, not because the electricity is 'used up' or the battery dies.",
