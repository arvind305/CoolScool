    "text": "Electric current is the flow of electric charges (electrons) through a conductor. For current to flow, a complete (closed) circuit is needed. A circuit consists of components like cell/battery (source), wires (conductors), switch (control), and load (like bulb). Conductors allow current to flow (metals like copper, aluminium), while insulators resist current flow (rubber, plastic, wood). Electric current has three main effects: heating effect (heater, bulb), magnetic effect (electromagnet), and chemical effect (electroplating). Standard symbols are used to draw circuit diagrams.",

A closed circuit has a complete path for the electric charges (electrons) to move through, allowing the current to flow continuously. An open circuit, on the other hand, has a break in the path, so the current cannot flow.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "An open circuit does not allow electric current to flow because there is a break in the path. The charges cannot complete the circuit and flow continuously.

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is Battery provides electrical energy, Switch is closed, Current flows through the bulb, Current returns to battery. This is because the battery is the source that provides the electrical energy, the switch controls the flow of current, the current then flows through the bulb (the load), and finally returns back to the battery to complete the circuit.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Current returns to battery, Switch is closed, Current flows through the bulb, Battery provides electrical energy. This is wrong because the current cannot flow back to the battery before the battery has provided the electrical energy to start the current flow. The correct sequence is that the battery provides the energy first, then the switch is closed to allow the current to flow through the circuit and the load (bulb), and finally the current returns to the battery to complete the loop."

      "explanation_correct": "Copper is the best conductor of electricity because it has free-flowing electrons that can easily move through the material. Iron is also a good conductor, but not as good as copper. Wood and rubber are poor conductors, or insulators, because they have tightly-bound electrons that do not allow current to flow easily.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct order from best to worst conductor is: Copper, Iron, Wood, Rubber. This is because copper has the most free-flowing electrons, allowing current to pass through easily. Iron also conducts well, but not as well as copper. Wood and rubber are insulators, meaning they resist the flow of electric current and are the worst conductors in this list."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order of the effects of electric current is Heating effect, Magnetic effect, Chemical effect. This is because the heating effect is the first and most basic effect of electric current, where the current flowing through a conductor causes it to heat up. The magnetic effect, where the current creates a magnetic field, comes next. And the chemical effect, where the current causes chemical reactions like electroplating, comes last.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Magnetic effect, Chemical effect, Heating effect. This is wrong because the heating effect is the most fundamental and immediate effect of electric current, and happens before the magnetic and chemical effects. The magnetic effect, where the current creates a magnetic field, happens after the heating effect. And the chemical effect, where the current causes chemical reactions like electroplating, happens last."

This is not the right order because you need to know the components in the circuit first before you can draw their symbols and the connecting wires. You should always check the circuit is complete at the end to ensure it will work properly."
