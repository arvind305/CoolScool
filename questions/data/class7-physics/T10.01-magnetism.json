    "text": "A magnet is an object that attracts magnetic materials like iron, cobalt, and nickel. Every magnet has two poles - North (N) and South (S). Like poles repel each other while unlike poles attract. The region around a magnet where its magnetic effect is felt is called the magnetic field. Magnetic field lines show the direction and strength of the magnetic field, going from North to South outside the magnet. An electromagnet is a temporary magnet created by passing electric current through a coil wound around an iron core. Electromagnets have many applications including electric bells, cranes, and speakers.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "No, like poles of magnets actually repel each other. This means that the North pole of one magnet will push away from the North pole of another magnet, and the South pole of one magnet will push away from the South pole of another magnet. The opposite is true - the North pole of one magnet will attract the South pole of another magnet.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement is false. The rule is that like poles (North-North or South-South) repel each other, while unlike poles (North-South) attract each other. This is because the magnetic field lines flow from the North pole to the South pole of a magnet. When you bring two like poles together, the field lines oppose each other, causing repulsion. But when you bring an North pole and a South pole together, the field lines flow smoothly, causing attraction."

      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is: Current flows through electromagnet, Electromagnet attracts iron strip, Hammer hits the gong, Circuit breaks and process repeats. This is because the electric current energizes the electromagnet, which then pulls the iron strip, causing the hammer to hit the gong. Then the circuit breaks, repeating the cycle.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Hammer hits the gong, Current flows through electromagnet, Electromagnet attracts iron strip, Circuit breaks and process repeats. This is wrong because the electromagnet needs to be activated first by the electric current before it can attract the iron strip and make the hammer hit the gong. The correct order starts with the current flowing through the electromagnet."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order from most magnetic to non-magnetic is: Iron, Nickel, Wood, Plastic. This is because iron and nickel are both strongly magnetic materials, while wood and plastic are non-magnetic materials that are not attracted to magnets.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Nickel, Iron, Wood, Plastic. While nickel is a magnetic material, iron is actually more strongly magnetic than nickel. Wood and plastic are both non-magnetic materials that are not attracted to magnets, so they should come after the magnetic materials in the order."
