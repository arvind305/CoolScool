    "text": "Integers are the set of whole numbers and their negatives, including zero. They are represented as {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}. Integers can be visualized on a number line where positive integers are to the right of zero and negative integers are to the left. Operations on integers follow specific rules: when adding integers with the same sign, add their absolute values and keep the sign; when adding integers with different signs, subtract the smaller absolute value from the larger and take the sign of the number with larger absolute value. For multiplication and division, the product or quotient of two integers with the same sign is positive, while the product or quotient of two integers with different signs is negative. Integer operations follow properties such as commutative (a + b = b + a, a × b = b × a), associative ((a + b) + c = a + (b + c), (a × b) × c = a × (b × c)), and distributive (a × (b + c) = a × b + a × c). Complex expressions are simplified using BODMAS/PEMDAS order of operations.",

In this case, (-8) - (-3) is the same as (-8) + 3, which equals -5.",
