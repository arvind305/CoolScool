Option C (1.2) is incorrect because when you divide 1.2 by 0.25, you get 4.8, which is not the given answer of 48. Option D (120) is incorrect because when you divide 120 by 0.25, you get 480, which is not the given answer of 48."

This is because the denominator (4) is a power of 10, making the decimal representation a simple division problem that can be expressed as a finite decimal.",
