    "text": "A rational number is any number that can be expressed in the form p/q, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. The set of rational numbers includes all integers, fractions, and terminating or repeating decimals. Rational numbers can be represented on a number line, compared using cross multiplication, and operated upon using standard arithmetic operations. The standard form of a rational number has no common factors between numerator and denominator (except 1), and the denominator is always positive.",
