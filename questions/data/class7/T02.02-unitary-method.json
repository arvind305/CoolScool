However, if you try to find the weight of one book by dividing the total weight of 8 books (12 kg) by 8, you will get 1.5 kg, which is the correct answer.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answers are: A) Rs. 180, C) Rs. 270, and D) Rs. 240. These answers are incorrect because they do not use the unitary method correctly.

      "explanation_correct": "The correct answer is 40 because if 12 oranges cost Rs. 96, then 1 orange costs Rs. 8 (96 / 12 = 8). To find the cost of 5 oranges, we can multiply the cost of 1 orange by 5, which gives us Rs. 40 (8 x 5 = 40).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to simply divide 96 by 5 to get 19.2. However, this is not the correct answer because the question states that 12 oranges cost Rs. 96, so we need to first find the cost of 1 orange, and then multiply it by 5 to get the cost of 5 oranges.

Therefore, 4 workers can complete the work in 12 days, as 4 workers can do 4 times the work of 1 worker in the same time.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answers are not correct because they do not correctly apply the unitary method. The unitary method involves finding the work done by one worker in one day, and then using that to calculate the number of days required for a different number of workers.

This is because the question states that the car travels 120 km in 3 hours, and we need to find how far it will travel in 5 hours at the same speed. To do this, we need to first find the speed of the car, which is 120 km / 3 hours = 40 km/hour.
