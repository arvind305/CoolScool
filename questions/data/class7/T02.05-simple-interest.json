      "explanation_correct": "The term used for the original amount of money borrowed or invested is called the 'principal'. This is the base amount on which the interest is calculated.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The term 'interest' refers to the extra amount paid or earned on the principal amount. The 'amount' is the total of the principal and the interest. The 'rate' is the percentage of interest charged or earned on the principal. Therefore, the correct term for the original amount borrowed or invested is 'principal'."

      "explanation_correct": "The rate of interest is always expressed per annum, which means 'per year'. This is a standard convention used in calculating simple interest, as the interest earned is proportional to the time period for which the money is borrowed or invested.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The rate of interest is not expressed per month or per day, but per annum (per year). This is because simple interest calculations are based on the yearly interest rate, and the time period is measured in years. Expressing the rate as 'per annum' ensures that the calculations are done correctly and the interest earned is proportional to the time period."

      "explanation_incorrect": "No, the statement is not correct. Simple interest is not calculated on the total amount, which includes both the principal and the interest earned. It is calculated only on the principal amount. For example, if you borrow $100 at 5% interest per year, the simple interest earned in the first year would be $5, which is 5% of the $100 principal."

The formula C) SI = P + R + T is also incorrect because simple interest is calculated as a percentage of the principal, not just a sum of the three values.
