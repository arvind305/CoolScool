This is because the sum of all angles in a triangle is always 180 degrees, and since an equilateral triangle has all sides equal, it also has all angles equal.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is B) 5. The third side of a right-angled triangle with sides 3 and 4 can be found using the Pythagoras Theorem. The formula is: a^2 + b^2 = c^2, where a and b are the lengths of the two shorter sides, and c is the length of the longest side (the hypotenuse). Plugging in the values, we get: 3^2 + 4^2 = c^2, which simplifies to 9 + 16 = 25, and the square root of 25 is 5."
