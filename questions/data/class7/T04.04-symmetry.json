It has 5 lines of symmetry, one through each vertex and one through the midpoint of each side. Option A, 3 lines of symmetry, is incorrect because a regular pentagon has more than 3 lines of symmetry.

It also does not have point symmetry, because if you rotate the letter around a point, the shape will not look the same. Therefore, the letter F has no symmetry at all."
