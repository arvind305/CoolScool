This is because the perpendicular bisector will pass through the midpoint of AB, and the intersections of the two arcs will give you the points to draw the perpendicular line.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct first step is to draw arcs from both ends A and B with a radius more than half of AB. This is because the perpendicular bisector will pass through the midpoint of AB, and the intersections of the two arcs will give you the points to draw the perpendicular line. Marking the midpoint directly or drawing a parallel line are not the correct first steps for this construction."

      "explanation_incorrect": "If the perpendicular bisector of a line segment did not divide it into two equal parts at a 90-degree angle, then it would not be a perpendicular bisector. The perpendicular bisector is a line that is perpendicular to the original line segment and passes through its midpoint, so it must cut the line segment into two equal halves at a 90-degree angle."
