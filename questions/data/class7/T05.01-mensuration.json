Option A (20 cm) is only half the actual perimeter, while options C (96 cm) and D (48 cm) are incorrect calculations.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The most common mistake is to think that the area of a triangle is simply the product of the base and height.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The length of each side of a square can be found by dividing the perimeter by 4, since all sides are equal. If the perimeter is 36 cm, dividing it by 4 gives the length of each side, which is 9 cm.

      "explanation_incorrect": "If the area of the rectangle is 72 cm² and the length is 9 cm, then the incorrect answer would be 7 cm. This is because the formula for the area of a rectangle is Area = length × breadth, and if we divide the area by the length, we get the breadth, which is 8 cm, not 7 cm."

      "type": "true_false",
      "explanation_correct": "If the base of a triangle is doubled while the height remains the same, the area will also double. This is because the area of a triangle is calculated using the formula: Area = (1/2) × base × height. If the base is doubled, but the height stays the same, the new area will be twice the original area.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "If the base of a triangle is doubled while the height remains the same, the area does not stay the same. Many students may think the area would stay the same, but this is not correct. The area of a triangle depends on both the base and the height, so if one of these changes, the area will also change. In this case, since the base is doubled, the area will also double."

This is because the perimeter is the total distance around the outer boundary of the shape, so you need to first identify all the outer edges, then measure their lengths, and finally add them up to get the perimeter.",

To find the area of the path, we need to calculate the perimeter of the garden (25 m + 16 m + 25 m + 16 m = 82 m) and multiply it by the width of the path (2 m), which gives us the area of the path as 82 m × 2 m = 156 m².",
