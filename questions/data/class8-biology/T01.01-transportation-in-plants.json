    "text": "Plants require a transport system to move water, minerals, and food throughout their body. Xylem is the vascular tissue responsible for transporting water and dissolved minerals from roots to leaves through a process called ascent of sap. Phloem transports food (mainly sucrose) from leaves to other parts of the plant through translocation. Diffusion is the movement of molecules from a region of higher concentration to lower concentration, while osmosis is the movement of water molecules through a semi-permeable membrane from a dilute solution to a concentrated solution. Transpiration, the loss of water vapor through stomata, creates a pull that helps in the ascent of sap. Root pressure, caused by active absorption of minerals by root cells, pushes water upward and can result in guttation - the exudation of water droplets from leaf margins.",

Without a transport system, these essential nutrients and substances cannot be distributed to different parts of the plant, which would prevent the plant from growing and surviving.",

While these are important processes, the primary reason plants require a transport system is to distribute water, minerals, and food throughout their entire body, which is necessary for their overall growth and development."

This is different from transpiration, which is the loss of water vapor through the stomata of the leaves.

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is Root hair, Root xylem, Xylem in stem, Leaf veins. This is the path that water takes from the soil to the leaves. The root hairs absorb water from the soil, which then travels through the root xylem to the stem xylem, and finally reaches the leaf veins.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be, for example, Leaf veins, Xylem in stem, Root xylem, Root hair. This is wrong because water does not travel from the leaves to the roots. Instead, it moves from the roots to the leaves, starting from the root hairs, then going through the root xylem, the stem xylem, and finally reaching the leaf veins."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order from lowest to highest effect on increasing transpiration rate is High humidity, Moderate humidity, Low humidity. High humidity reduces the water vapor gradient between the leaf and the surrounding air, leading to a lower transpiration rate. Low humidity increases this gradient, resulting in a higher transpiration rate.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Low humidity, Moderate humidity, High humidity. This is wrong because low humidity has the highest effect on increasing transpiration rate. When the air has low humidity, it can hold less water vapor, creating a greater water vapor gradient between the leaf and the air. This increases the rate of transpiration as water evaporates more rapidly from the leaf surface."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is 'Water concentration is higher outside cell, Water enters cell through membrane, Cell becomes turgid' because osmosis is the movement of water molecules from a region of higher water concentration (outside the cell) to a region of lower water concentration (inside the cell) through the semi-permeable cell membrane, causing the cell to swell up and become turgid.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order is not accurate because the first step in osmosis is that the water concentration is higher outside the cell, compared to inside the cell. This water concentration difference drives the movement of water molecules through the cell membrane, causing the cell to become turgid or swell up. The order 'Water enters cell through membrane, Cell becomes turgid, Water concentration is higher outside cell' is incorrect because it does not match the actual sequence of events in osmosis."
