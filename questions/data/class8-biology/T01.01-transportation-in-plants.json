    "text": "Plants require a transport system to move water, minerals, and food throughout their body. Xylem is the vascular tissue responsible for transporting water and dissolved minerals from roots to leaves through a process called ascent of sap. Phloem transports food (mainly sucrose) from leaves to other parts of the plant through translocation. Diffusion is the movement of molecules from a region of higher concentration to lower concentration, while osmosis is the movement of water molecules through a semi-permeable membrane from a dilute solution to a concentrated solution. Transpiration, the loss of water vapor through stomata, creates a pull that helps in the ascent of sap. Root pressure, caused by active absorption of minerals by root cells, pushes water upward and can result in guttation - the exudation of water droplets from leaf margins.",
    "rules": [
      "Xylem transports water and minerals from roots to leaves (unidirectional)",
      "Phloem transports food from leaves to all parts (bidirectional)",
      "Xylem consists of vessels, tracheids, xylem parenchyma, and xylem fibers",
      "Phloem consists of sieve tubes, companion cells, phloem parenchyma, and phloem fibers",
      "Diffusion occurs from higher to lower concentration without membrane",
      "Osmosis is diffusion of water through a semi-permeable membrane",
      "Transpiration creates transpiration pull for ascent of sap",
      "Root pressure pushes water upward, especially at night when transpiration is low",
      "Guttation occurs due to root pressure when humidity is high and transpiration is low"
