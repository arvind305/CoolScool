    "text": "Reproduction in plants can be sexual or asexual. Asexual reproduction produces offspring from a single parent without gamete fusion. Methods include budding (yeast), fragmentation (algae), binary fission (bacteria), spore formation (ferns, fungi), and vegetative propagation (using plant parts like stems, roots, leaves). Vegetative propagation can be natural (runners, tubers) or artificial (cutting, layering, grafting, tissue culture). Sexual reproduction involves gamete fusion. A flower is the reproductive organ with sepals, petals, stamens (male), and carpel/pistil (female). Pollination is pollen transfer to stigma - self-pollination (same flower) or cross-pollination (different flowers). Fertilization occurs when pollen tube delivers male gamete to ovule, forming a zygote that develops into seed and fruit.",

The new individual is genetically identical to the parent, since it is produced from a single parent without any genetic recombination.",

It produces offspring from a single parent, without the need for sexual reproduction. Asexual methods include budding, fragmentation, binary fission, spore formation, and vegetative propagation. The offspring are genetically identical to the parent."

Runners are the horizontal stems of the strawberry plant that spread along the ground and take root, allowing the plant to grow new individual plants.

Wind-pollinated flowers do not need to attract insects, so they lack bright colours, nectar, and strong scent. The feathery stigma increases the surface area to trap pollen carried by wind.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Insect-pollinated flowers have bright colours, strong fragrance, and sticky pollen — the opposite of what Priya observes. Water pollination occurs in aquatic plants. Self-pollination describes pollen transfer within the same flower but does not explain the specific adaptations like feathery stigmas and powdery pollen, which are wind-pollination features."

Fragmentation is a common method of asexual reproduction in simple multicellular organisms like algae. Each broken piece has the ability to regenerate and develop into a new individual, which is exactly what Rohan observed.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Budding involves a small outgrowth forming on the parent (as in yeast), not the body breaking apart. Binary fission is the division of a single cell into two equal halves (as in bacteria). Spore formation involves producing specialised reproductive cells. The key clue is that the algae broke into pieces and each piece grew into a new strand, which describes fragmentation."

This is widely used in agriculture to produce plants with the best traits of two different varieties.",

This is a survival strategy to compensate for the randomness of wind dispersal.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because wind is actually an inefficient carrier — most pollen is wasted, which is why large quantities are needed. Option C is wrong because wind-pollinated pollen is actually light and smooth, not heavy.

It then delivers the male gametes directly to the egg cell for fertilization. Without this tube, the male gametes would have no way to reach the female gametes.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because the pollen tube's function is to transport male gametes, not to provide nutrients — that is the role of the endosperm. Option C is wrong because the pollen tube grows inside the pistil and has nothing to do with protecting from insects.
