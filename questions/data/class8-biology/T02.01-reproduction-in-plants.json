    "text": "Reproduction in plants can be sexual or asexual. Asexual reproduction produces offspring from a single parent without gamete fusion. Methods include budding (yeast), fragmentation (algae), binary fission (bacteria), spore formation (ferns, fungi), and vegetative propagation (using plant parts like stems, roots, leaves). Vegetative propagation can be natural (runners, tubers) or artificial (cutting, layering, grafting, tissue culture). Sexual reproduction involves gamete fusion. A flower is the reproductive organ with sepals, petals, stamens (male), and carpel/pistil (female). Pollination is pollen transfer to stigma - self-pollination (same flower) or cross-pollination (different flowers). Fertilization occurs when pollen tube delivers male gamete to ovule, forming a zygote that develops into seed and fruit.",

The new individual is genetically identical to the parent, since it is produced from a single parent without any genetic recombination.",

It produces offspring from a single parent, without the need for sexual reproduction. Asexual methods include budding, fragmentation, binary fission, spore formation, and vegetative propagation. The offspring are genetically identical to the parent."

Runners are the horizontal stems of the strawberry plant that spread along the ground and take root, allowing the plant to grow new individual plants.

      "explanation_correct": "The outer protective covering of a seed is called the seed coat. This layer protects the delicate embryo inside the seed and helps it survive until conditions are right for it to germinate and grow into a new plant.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 'coat'. The seed coat is the outermost layer of the seed that protects the embryo inside. It is not the 'shell' or 'husk' - those terms refer to the fruit covering, not the actual seed itself. The seed coat is an important part of the seed that helps it survive until it can germinate and grow into a new plant."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Pollen tube grows through style, Pollen lands on stigma, Male gamete fuses with egg, Pollen tube enters ovule. This is incorrect because the pollen first needs to land on the stigma before the pollen tube can grow through the style and enter the ovule, where the male gamete will then fuse with the egg to form a zygote."

Runners are a natural way plants propagate vegetatively, by growing horizontal stems that develop roots and shoots. Grafting is an artificial method, where a stem or bud is attached to a rootstock.

This is wrong because the flower parts are typically arranged in a specific order, with the sepals as the outermost layer, followed by the petals, then the stamens, and finally the carpel at the center. The sepals and petals form the two main whorls of the flower, with the stamens and carpel as the inner reproductive parts."
