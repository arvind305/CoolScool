    "text": "Human reproduction is sexual, involving male and female reproductive systems. The male system includes testes (produce sperm), epididymis, vas deferens, and accessory glands. Sperm has a head (with nucleus), middle piece (mitochondria), and tail (for movement). The female system includes ovaries (produce eggs/ova), fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina. The menstrual cycle is approximately 28 days with phases: menstrual (bleeding), follicular (egg development), ovulation (egg release), and luteal (preparation for pregnancy). Fertilization occurs in the fallopian tube when sperm meets egg. The zygote divides and implants in the uterus. The placenta provides nutrients and oxygen to the developing embryo/fetus. Pregnancy lasts about 9 months. Puberty brings physical changes and development of secondary sexual characteristics.",

The uterus is where the fertilized egg (zygote) implants and the fetus develops, not where sperm is produced. The prostate gland is an accessory sex gland that helps in the production of seminal fluid, not sperm."

The uterus is where the fertilized egg implants and the developing embryo/fetus grows, but it does not produce eggs. The fallopian tubes are the pathways that allow the egg to travel from the ovary to the uterus, but they do not produce the eggs themselves. The correct answer is the ovaries, as this is where the female reproductive cells (eggs/ova) are produced."

        "Follicular phase",

      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The correct order of the menstrual cycle phases is Menstrual phase, Follicular phase, Ovulation, and Luteal phase. This is because the cycle starts with the shedding of the uterine lining during the Menstrual phase, followed by the Follicular phase where an egg develops, then Ovulation when the egg is released, and finally the Luteal phase where the uterus prepares for possible implantation of a fertilized egg.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Luteal phase, Menstrual phase, Ovulation, Follicular phase. This is wrong because the Luteal phase comes after Ovulation, not before the Menstrual phase. The correct order is Menstrual phase, Follicular phase, Ovulation, and then Luteal phase."
