    "text": "Human reproduction is sexual, involving male and female reproductive systems. The male system includes testes (produce sperm), epididymis, vas deferens, and accessory glands. Sperm has a head (with nucleus), middle piece (mitochondria), and tail (for movement). The female system includes ovaries (produce eggs/ova), fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina. The menstrual cycle is approximately 28 days with phases: menstrual (bleeding), follicular (egg development), ovulation (egg release), and luteal (preparation for pregnancy). Fertilization occurs in the fallopian tube when sperm meets egg. The zygote divides and implants in the uterus. The placenta provides nutrients and oxygen to the developing embryo/fetus. Pregnancy lasts about 9 months. Puberty brings physical changes and development of secondary sexual characteristics.",
    "rules": [
      "Testes: produce sperm, located in scrotum",

The uterus is where the fertilized egg (zygote) implants and the fetus develops, not where sperm is produced. The prostate gland is an accessory sex gland that helps in the production of seminal fluid, not sperm."

The uterus is where the fertilized egg implants and the developing embryo/fetus grows, but it does not produce eggs. The fallopian tubes are the pathways that allow the egg to travel from the ovary to the uterus, but they do not produce the eggs themselves. The correct answer is the ovaries, as this is where the female reproductive cells (eggs/ova) are produced."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'puberty'. Puberty is the period of physical changes that happen as you grow from a child into an adult. During this time, your body starts to produce hormones that cause changes like the development of breasts, facial hair, and the ability to have children. The other options like 'adolescence' or 'maturity' do not specifically refer to this important stage of physical development."
