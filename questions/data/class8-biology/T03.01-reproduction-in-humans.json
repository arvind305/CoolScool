    "text": "Human reproduction is sexual, involving male and female reproductive systems. The male system includes testes (produce sperm), epididymis, vas deferens, and accessory glands. Sperm has a head (with nucleus), middle piece (mitochondria), and tail (for movement). The female system includes ovaries (produce eggs/ova), fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina. The menstrual cycle is approximately 28 days with phases: menstrual (bleeding), follicular (egg development), ovulation (egg release), and luteal (preparation for pregnancy). Fertilization occurs in the fallopian tube when sperm meets egg. The zygote divides and implants in the uterus. The placenta provides nutrients and oxygen to the developing embryo/fetus. Pregnancy lasts about 9 months. Puberty brings physical changes and development of secondary sexual characteristics.",
    "rules": [
      "Testes: produce sperm, located in scrotum",
      "Ovaries: produce ova (eggs), located in abdomen",
      "Sperm: head, middle piece, tail structure",
      "Menstrual cycle: approximately 28 days",
      "Ovulation: release of egg from ovary (around day 14)",
      "Fertilization: fusion of sperm and egg in fallopian tube",
      "Implantation: zygote attaches to uterine wall",
      "Placenta: provides nutrients, oxygen, removes waste",
      "Pregnancy duration: approximately 9 months (280 days)",
      "Puberty: transition from childhood to adulthood"
