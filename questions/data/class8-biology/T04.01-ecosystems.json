    "text": "An ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with their physical environment. Forests are important ecosystems providing oxygen, habitat, and climate regulation. Ecosystems have biotic (living) components - producers (plants), consumers (animals), and decomposers (fungi, bacteria) - and abiotic (non-living) components like temperature, light, water, and soil. A food chain shows energy flow from producer to consumers. Multiple food chains form a food web. Energy decreases at each trophic level (10% law - only 10% energy passes to next level). Biomes are large geographic regions with similar climate and organisms. Ecosystem threats include deforestation, pollution, and climate change. Conservation efforts include protected areas, sustainable practices, and reforestation.",

The living organisms interact with the physical, non-living environment around them to form the complete ecosystem. Simply having only plants or only the physical environment would not be considered a full ecosystem."

The producers (plants) are at the first trophic level, followed by the consumers (animals) at higher trophic levels.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'trophic'. The term 'trophic' refers to the feeding levels in a food chain. It is not the same as 'trophy', which means a prize or award. In an ecosystem, the feeding levels from producers to consumers are called trophic levels, not trophy levels."

A) Top predators do not necessarily reproduce less than other organisms. C) Top predators can have a wide range of lifespans.

      "explanation_correct": "The taiga biome is characterized by coniferous (evergreen) forests and long, cold winters, which is the correct answer. This biome is found in the northern regions of North America, Europe, and Asia, where the climate is cool and dry.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is the 'taiga' biome. The taiga is a large biome found in the northern regions, with coniferous forests and long, harsh winters. Other biomes like the tropical rainforest or the grassland have different characteristics and are not the correct answer for this question."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order of the aquatic food chain is Phytoplankton, Zooplankton, Small fish, Shark. This is because phytoplankton are the producers that make food from sunlight, zooplankton eat the phytoplankton, small fish eat the zooplankton, and the shark is the top consumer that eats the small fish. This shows the flow of energy from the producers to the consumers in the ecosystem.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Shark, Phytoplankton, Small fish, Zooplankton. This is wrong because the shark, as the top predator, should be placed at the end of the food chain, not the beginning. The correct order starts with the producers (phytoplankton) at the bottom, then the zooplankton that eat the phytoplankton, followed by the small fish that eat the zooplankton, and finally the shark at the top as the main consumer."

Green plants get their energy directly from the sun through photosynthesis, so they have the most available energy. Herbivores get energy by eating the plants, but some energy is lost. Secondary consumers eat the herbivores, and top carnivores eat the secondary consumers, further decreasing the available energy at each level.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Top carnivore, Secondary consumer, Herbivore, Green plant. This is wrong because energy always decreases as you move up the food chain. Top carnivores have the least available energy since they are at the top of the food chain and have to pass through multiple steps to get that energy. Green plants have the most available energy since they get it directly from the sun through photosynthesis."
