    "text": "An ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with their physical environment. Forests are important ecosystems providing oxygen, habitat, and climate regulation. Ecosystems have biotic (living) components - producers (plants), consumers (animals), and decomposers (fungi, bacteria) - and abiotic (non-living) components like temperature, light, water, and soil. A food chain shows energy flow from producer to consumers. Multiple food chains form a food web. Energy decreases at each trophic level (10% law - only 10% energy passes to next level). Biomes are large geographic regions with similar climate and organisms. Ecosystem threats include deforestation, pollution, and climate change. Conservation efforts include protected areas, sustainable practices, and reforestation.",
