    "text": "The endocrine system consists of glands that secrete hormones directly into the blood. Hormones are chemical messengers that regulate body functions. The pituitary gland (master gland) is located at the base of the brain and secretes hormones like growth hormone (GH), thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), and others that control other glands. The thyroid gland in the neck produces thyroxine, which regulates metabolism. Thyroid disorders include goitre (iodine deficiency), hypothyroidism (low thyroxine), and hyperthyroidism (excess thyroxine). Adrenal glands produce adrenaline (epinephrine) for fight-or-flight response. The pancreas produces insulin (lowers blood sugar) and glucagon (raises blood sugar). Diabetes mellitus results from insulin deficiency or resistance.",

      "correct_answer": "goitre",
      "explanation_correct": "The enlarged thyroid gland due to iodine deficiency is called a goitre. This is because iodine is a key nutrient needed for the thyroid gland to produce thyroxine hormone, and lack of iodine causes the thyroid to enlarge in an attempt to produce more of this important hormone.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The enlarged thyroid gland is not called 'thyroid enlargement' or 'thyroid swelling', but is specifically referred to as a goitre. A goitre is the medical term for an enlarged thyroid gland, and it is caused by a lack of iodine in the diet, which leads the thyroid to grow larger as it tries to produce enough thyroid hormones for the body's needs."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "Rohan's significantly short stature despite adequate nutrition, combined with the test showing low levels of a pituitary hormone, points to growth hormone deficiency. Growth hormone is secreted by the pituitary gland and is essential for normal growth during childhood and adolescence. Its deficiency leads to pituitary dwarfism.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Thyroxine is produced by the thyroid gland, not the pituitary gland. Insulin is produced by the pancreas, and its deficiency causes diabetes, not short stature. Adrenaline is produced by the adrenal glands. The question specifically mentions a pituitary gland hormone deficiency combined with short stature, which clearly indicates growth hormone."

The key clue is that his body cannot properly use insulin (insulin resistance), which means glucose accumulates in the blood instead of being absorbed by cells. Diabetes is managed through diet control, regular exercise, and medication -- exactly what the doctor advised. This is characteristic of Type 2 diabetes mellitus.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Goitre is an enlarged thyroid due to iodine deficiency and has nothing to do with insulin. Gigantism is caused by excess growth hormone in children. Hyperthyroidism involves excess thyroxine production. The specific mention of the body not properly using insulin, along with the management plan of diet, exercise, and medication, is the hallmark of diabetes mellitus."

In reality, hormones are highly efficient chemical messengers that produce significant effects with only tiny amounts.",

Students often assume the pancreas is only endocrine because they study it in the hormone chapter, but it has a dual role.",

Instead, insulin release is triggered by blood glucose levels -- when blood sugar rises, the pancreatic beta cells release insulin directly in response. Students often assume the pituitary (master gland) controls ALL endocrine glands, but the pancreas regulates insulin independently based on blood sugar levels.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The pituitary gland does control the thyroid gland (through TSH), the adrenal cortex (through ACTH), and growth and development (through growth hormone). However, insulin secretion by the pancreas is regulated by blood glucose concentration, not by pituitary hormones. The pancreas responds directly to changes in blood sugar rather than waiting for pituitary signals."

The muscles require a sudden burst of energy during emergencies, and a faster heartbeat ensures they get the fuel they need quickly.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "While adrenaline does slow digestion, that is not the reason for the increased heart rate. Option C is incorrect because adrenaline actually increases blood flow to the brain for better alertness, not reduces it. Option D is completely wrong -- adrenaline makes the body more alert and active, not sleepy. The increased heart rate serves the specific purpose of delivering more oxygen and energy to muscles for immediate action."

In hilly and mountainous regions of India, the soil and water naturally lack sufficient iodine, which means the food grown there is also iodine-deficient. Without dietary iodine supplementation through iodised salt, people in these regions are at high risk of developing goitre and other thyroid disorders.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Iodine is not needed by the pancreas for insulin production (A), by the pituitary for growth hormone (C), or by the adrenal glands for adrenaline (D). Iodine is specifically and exclusively required by the thyroid gland for the production of thyroxine. The geographical link to hilly regions is important because the natural iodine content in soil and water is lower at higher altitudes."

It essentially acts as a central controller that coordinates the activity of the entire endocrine system through its stimulating hormones.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong -- the pituitary is actually one of the smallest glands (pea-sized). Option B is partially true but misses the key reason -- it is not called the master gland simply because it produces many hormones or is in the brain. Option D is incorrect because the pituitary is a ductless endocrine gland and communicates through blood, not ducts. The true reason is its ability to regulate other glands through its hormones."
