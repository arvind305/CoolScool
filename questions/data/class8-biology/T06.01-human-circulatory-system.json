    "text": "The circulatory system transports blood throughout the body. Blood consists of plasma (liquid), red blood cells (RBCs - carry oxygen using hemoglobin), white blood cells (WBCs - fight infection), and platelets (blood clotting). The ABO blood group system has types A, B, AB, and O based on antigens. The Rh factor makes blood Rh positive or negative. The heart is a four-chambered muscular organ with two atria (upper) and two ventricles (lower). Valves prevent backflow. Blood vessels include arteries (carry blood away from heart, thick walls), veins (carry blood to heart, have valves), and capillaries (thin walls for exchange). Double circulation means blood passes through the heart twice in one complete circuit - pulmonary (heart-lungs-heart) and systemic (heart-body-heart). The lymphatic system helps immunity and fluid balance.",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is Right atrium, Right ventricle, Left atrium, Left ventricle because blood flows from the right atrium to the right ventricle, then to the lungs, then back to the left atrium, and finally to the left ventricle before being pumped out to the body.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Left ventricle, Right atrium, Right ventricle, Left atrium. This is not correct because blood does not flow from the left ventricle to the right atrium. Instead, it flows from the right atrium to the right ventricle, then to the lungs, and back to the left atrium before going to the left ventricle."
