    "text": "The nervous system coordinates body activities through electrical signals. The basic unit is the neuron, consisting of cell body (contains nucleus), dendrites (receive signals), and axon (transmits signals). Neurons are sensory (carry signals to brain), motor (carry signals from brain), or relay (connect neurons). Signals pass between neurons at synapses. The central nervous system (CNS) includes the brain and spinal cord. The brain has three main parts: cerebrum (thinking, memory, senses), cerebellum (balance, coordination), and medulla oblongata (involuntary functions like breathing). The brain is protected by skull, meninges, and cerebrospinal fluid. The peripheral nervous system includes cranial and spinal nerves. Reflex actions are automatic, rapid responses to stimuli that don't involve conscious thought. The reflex arc includes receptor, sensory neuron, relay neuron, motor neuron, and effector.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The order should be Cerebrum, Cerebellum, Medulla oblongata, not the other way around. The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain, followed by the cerebellum, and then the medulla oblongata is the smallest. This order reflects the relative sizes of these three main brain regions, with the cerebrum being the largest and the medulla oblongata being the smallest."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is: Dendrite receives stimulus, Electrical impulse travels down axon, Neurotransmitter crosses synapse, Next neuron receives signal. This is the sequence of how a nerve signal is transmitted from one neuron to the next through a synapse.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Electrical impulse travels down axon, Neurotransmitter crosses synapse, Next neuron receives signal, Dendrite receives stimulus. This is not correct because the process starts with the dendrite receiving the initial stimulus, which then triggers the electrical impulse to travel down the axon. The neurotransmitter then crosses the synapse to allow the signal to be received by the next neuron."
