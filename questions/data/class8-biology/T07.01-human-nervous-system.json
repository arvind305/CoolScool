    "text": "The nervous system coordinates body activities through electrical signals. The basic unit is the neuron, consisting of cell body (contains nucleus), dendrites (receive signals), and axon (transmits signals). Neurons are sensory (carry signals to brain), motor (carry signals from brain), or relay (connect neurons). Signals pass between neurons at synapses. The central nervous system (CNS) includes the brain and spinal cord. The brain has three main parts: cerebrum (thinking, memory, senses), cerebellum (balance, coordination), and medulla oblongata (involuntary functions like breathing). The brain is protected by skull, meninges, and cerebrospinal fluid. The peripheral nervous system includes cranial and spinal nerves. Reflex actions are automatic, rapid responses to stimuli that don't involve conscious thought. The reflex arc includes receptor, sensory neuron, relay neuron, motor neuron, and effector.",

When Priya's grandfather's spinal cord was injured, the pathway for nerve signals between the brain and the leg muscles was disrupted. Even though his brain can still generate the commands to move his legs, those signals cannot travel past the damaged section of the spinal cord to reach the motor neurons controlling the leg muscles.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The question states that the injury is to the spinal cord, not to the leg muscles, so option A is incorrect. Option C is wrong because the cerebellum controls balance and coordination, and even if it were affected, it would not completely prevent leg movement. Option D is incorrect because the problem is not with the sensory neurons in the legs but with the signal pathway through the spinal cord being broken."

However, she is stumbling and dropping things, which are signs of poor balance and coordination. These functions are controlled by the cerebellum. If the cerebellum were damaged, a person would have difficulty with coordinated movements, balance, and fine motor control, exactly matching Meera's symptoms.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "If the cerebrum were damaged, Meera would have trouble remembering facts and thinking clearly, but she can do both. Damage to the medulla oblongata would affect breathing and heartbeat, which are not the symptoms described. The hypothalamus controls body temperature and hunger, not coordination. Since Meera's problem is specifically with balance and coordination while her thinking and memory are intact, the cerebellum is the most likely affected area."

If a disease destroys this myelin sheath, nerve impulses would travel much more slowly along the axons. This would result in delayed responses, poor coordination, muscle weakness, and other neurological problems because the signals from the brain would take longer to reach the muscles and organs.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is the opposite of what would happen -- without myelin, impulses slow down, not speed up. Option C is incorrect because myelin destruction affects signal transmission speed along axons, not neurotransmitter production at synapses. Option D is wrong because myelin covers axons, not synapses, so its destruction would not affect the width of synaptic gaps. The loss of myelin directly impairs the speed of nerve signal conduction."

You decide to pick up the pen, plan the movement, and then carry it out. In contrast, pulling your hand from a hot surface, blinking when dust enters the eye, and the knee-jerk response are all genuine reflex actions -- they happen automatically and rapidly without conscious thought, controlled by the spinal cord.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Pulling your hand away from heat, blinking in response to dust, and the knee-jerk response are all classic examples of reflex actions because they happen automatically without you thinking about them. Picking up a pen requires you to make a conscious decision and direct your muscles deliberately, making it a voluntary action, not a reflex. Students sometimes confuse quick voluntary movements with reflexes, but the key distinction is whether the brain is involved in the decision to act."

If the signal had to travel all the way to the brain for processing, the delay could result in injury.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because the spinal cord is actually much smaller than the brain; size is not the reason for its role in reflexes. Option C is incorrect because the brain is connected to sensory neurons and can process sensory information, but this takes more time. Option D is wrong because the spinal cord does not store memories -- memory is a function of the cerebrum. The real reason is the speed advantage of the shorter pathway through the spinal cord."
