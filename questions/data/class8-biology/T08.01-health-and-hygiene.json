    "text": "Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being. Hygiene refers to practices that maintain health and prevent disease. Diseases are classified by occurrence (endemic, epidemic, pandemic, sporadic) and cause (communicable/infectious vs non-communicable). Communicable diseases spread through direct contact, airborne droplets, contaminated water/food, or vectors (mosquitoes, flies). Common diseases include viral (cold, flu), bacterial, and vector-borne (malaria, dengue by mosquitoes). Prevention includes vaccination (active immunity), maintaining hygiene, and vector control. First aid is immediate help given before medical treatment. Substance abuse (tobacco, alcohol) harms health. Mental health and stress management are important aspects of overall well-being.",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is: Pathogen exists in reservoir, Pathogen leaves infected person, Pathogen enters new host, Disease develops in new host. This is the logical sequence of how a disease spreads - the pathogen lives in a reservoir, then leaves the infected person, enters a new person, and causes disease in that new host.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Disease develops in new host, Pathogen enters new host, Pathogen leaves infected person, Pathogen exists in reservoir. This is not the right sequence because the disease cannot develop in the new host until the pathogen has first entered that new host. The pathogen has to leave the infected person and exist in a reservoir before it can infect the new host and cause disease."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order of the mosquito life cycle is egg, larva, pupa, and then adult. This is because the mosquito starts as an egg, which hatches into a larva (or wriggler) that lives in water. The larva then transforms into a pupa, which is the resting stage before the adult mosquito emerges.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to start with the adult mosquito. However, the adult mosquito lays eggs, which then hatch into larvae that live in water. The larvae then transform into pupae, which is the resting stage before the adult mosquito emerges. So the correct order is egg, larva, pupa, and then adult."

An epidemic is a disease that spreads quickly through a community or region. An endemic disease is regularly found in a specific geographic area. A sporadic disease occurs in isolated cases without a clear pattern or spread."
