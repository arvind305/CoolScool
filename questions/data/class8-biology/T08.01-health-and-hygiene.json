    "text": "Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being. Hygiene refers to practices that maintain health and prevent disease. Diseases are classified by occurrence (endemic, epidemic, pandemic, sporadic) and cause (communicable/infectious vs non-communicable). Communicable diseases spread through direct contact, airborne droplets, contaminated water/food, or vectors (mosquitoes, flies). Common diseases include viral (cold, flu), bacterial, and vector-borne (malaria, dengue by mosquitoes). Prevention includes vaccination (active immunity), maintaining hygiene, and vector control. First aid is immediate help given before medical treatment. Substance abuse (tobacco, alcohol) harms health. Mental health and stress management are important aspects of overall well-being.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "Vaccination leads to active immunity. When weakened pathogens from the DPT vaccine enter Priya's brother's body, his immune system recognises them and produces its own antibodies. The body also creates memory cells, so if the real pathogens are encountered later, the immune system can respond quickly. This is active immunity because the body actively produces the defence.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because immunity type depends on how antibodies are produced, not who administers the vaccine. Option B is incorrect because weakened pathogens still trigger an immune response — that is the whole point of vaccination. Option D is wrong because weakened pathogens are not antibodies; they stimulate the body to produce its own antibodies, which is active, not passive, immunity."

The canteen worker was coughing and sneezing, which releases tiny droplets containing the virus into the air. Students who breathed in these droplets or came in close contact were likely infected. This is a classic example of airborne or droplet transmission of communicable diseases.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because mosquitoes are not involved in this scenario — the illness clearly originated from the coughing canteen worker. Option C is wrong because waterborne diseases like cholera cause diarrhoea, not cold-like symptoms. Option D is incorrect because the pattern of many students falling ill after exposure to a sick person clearly indicates a communicable disease, not a non-communicable condition."

Secondhand smoke contains the same harmful chemicals as the smoke inhaled by the smoker, including tar and carbon monoxide. Regular exposure to secondhand smoke can cause coughing, breathing problems, and even increase the risk of lung disease in non-smokers.",

Malaria, dengue, and chikungunya are all genuinely vector-borne diseases transmitted by mosquitoes.",

This is passive immunity, even though it involves a deliberate medical procedure. Vaccines (options A, C, D) all stimulate the body to produce its own antibodies, which is active immunity.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The polio vaccine (A), BCG vaccine (C), and DPT booster (D) all contain weakened or killed pathogens that stimulate the body's own immune system to produce antibodies — this is active immunity. The antiserum injection is the exception because it provides pre-made antibodies directly, meaning the body plays no active role in producing them, making it passive immunity despite being a medical procedure."

This means malaria cases occur regularly and predictably year after year at a baseline level. An epidemic would involve a sudden, unexpected surge in cases beyond this normal level.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because endemic does not mean few cases — it means cases occur consistently at an expected level, which could be high. Option C describes a pandemic, not an endemic disease. Option D is wrong because malaria is transmitted between people (via mosquitoes), but this does not determine whether it is endemic or epidemic — what matters is the pattern of occurrence."
