    "text": "Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being. Hygiene refers to practices that maintain health and prevent disease. Diseases are classified by occurrence (endemic, epidemic, pandemic, sporadic) and cause (communicable/infectious vs non-communicable). Communicable diseases spread through direct contact, airborne droplets, contaminated water/food, or vectors (mosquitoes, flies). Common diseases include viral (cold, flu), bacterial, and vector-borne (malaria, dengue by mosquitoes). Prevention includes vaccination (active immunity), maintaining hygiene, and vector control. First aid is immediate help given before medical treatment. Substance abuse (tobacco, alcohol) harms health. Mental health and stress management are important aspects of overall well-being.",
