    "text": "Food production involves agriculture and animal husbandry. Microorganisms play important roles - bacteria in fermentation and nitrogen fixation, fungi in bread and cheese making, while some cause food spoilage. Crops are classified as food crops (rice, wheat), cash crops (cotton, sugarcane), and fiber crops (jute). Seasonal crops include Kharif (monsoon - rice, maize), Rabi (winter - wheat, gram), and Zaid (summer - watermelon, cucumber). Animal husbandry includes dairy farming (White Revolution), poultry (layers for eggs, broilers for meat), and fish farming (pisciculture). Sericulture is silk production from silkworms, and apiculture is beekeeping for honey. Organic farming avoids synthetic chemicals and focuses on sustainable practices.",
