    "text": "Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. All matter is made up of tiny particles (atoms and molecules) that are constantly in motion. The Kinetic Theory of Matter explains the behavior of matter in its three states: solid, liquid, and gas. According to this theory, particles of matter have kinetic energy and are in continuous random motion. The kinetic energy increases with temperature. Matter can change from one state to another by gaining or losing energy. The Law of Conservation of Mass states that matter can neither be created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction; it can only be transformed from one form to another.",
