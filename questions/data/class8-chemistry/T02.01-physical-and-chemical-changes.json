    "text": "Changes in matter are classified as physical or chemical. Physical changes are temporary, reversible changes where no new substance is formed. The chemical composition remains the same, only the physical properties (shape, size, state) change. Examples include melting ice, dissolving sugar, and breaking glass. Chemical changes are permanent, usually irreversible changes where new substances with different properties are formed. Indicators of chemical change include color change, gas evolution, precipitate formation, temperature change, and change in smell. Conditions for chemical reactions include contact between reactants, proper temperature, presence of catalyst, and sometimes light.",

For example, when ice melts, it can be refrozen to form ice again. No new substances are produced in a physical change, so option A is incorrect. Option C is also incorrect, as physical changes are usually reversible. Option D is incorrect because energy may be absorbed or released during a physical change, but it is not always released."

      "explanation_correct": "A catalyst is a substance that speeds up a chemical reaction without being used up or changed itself. It helps the reaction happen faster by providing an alternative pathway that requires less energy. This allows the reaction to occur more quickly, but the catalyst is not consumed or transformed in the process.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The answer 'catalyst' is correct. A catalyst is a substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without being used up itself. It does not change the overall chemical reaction, but it provides an alternate pathway that requires less energy, allowing the reaction to proceed faster. Other substances like reactants or products are changed during the reaction, but a catalyst remains the same."

Burning a candle is a chemical change because the wax reacts with oxygen to produce new products like carbon dioxide and water vapor.

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is 'Reactants in contact', 'Energy supplied', and 'Products formed' because for a chemical reaction to occur, the reactants (starting materials) must first come into contact with each other. Then, energy (such as heat, light, or electricity) must be supplied to the reactants to start the reaction. Finally, the reaction produces new substances, known as the products.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be 'Products formed', 'Reactants in contact', and 'Energy supplied'. This is wrong because the products are the result of the chemical reaction, not a condition for it to occur. The reactants must first come into contact, and then energy must be supplied to start the reaction and produce the new products."

      "explanation_correct": "Melting ice is the most reversible physical change, as the ice can easily be refrozen back into its original solid state. Dissolving salt in water is also reversible, as the salt can be recovered by evaporating the water. Breaking glass is the least reversible, as it is very difficult to put the broken pieces back together into their original form.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The order from most reversible to least reversible is incorrect. Breaking glass is the least reversible physical change, as it is very difficult to put the broken pieces back together. Dissolving salt in water is more reversible than breaking glass, as the salt can be recovered by evaporating the water. Melting ice is the most reversible, as the ice can easily be refrozen back into its original solid state."
