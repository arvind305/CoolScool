    "text": "Changes in matter are classified as physical or chemical. Physical changes are temporary, reversible changes where no new substance is formed. The chemical composition remains the same, only the physical properties (shape, size, state) change. Examples include melting ice, dissolving sugar, and breaking glass. Chemical changes are permanent, usually irreversible changes where new substances with different properties are formed. Indicators of chemical change include color change, gas evolution, precipitate formation, temperature change, and change in smell. Conditions for chemical reactions include contact between reactants, proper temperature, presence of catalyst, and sometimes light.",
