    "text": "Matter is classified into pure substances and mixtures. Pure substances have fixed composition and definite properties. Elements are the simplest pure substances that cannot be broken down into simpler substances. Elements are classified as metals (lustrous, malleable, ductile, conductors), non-metals (dull, brittle, insulators), metalloids (intermediate properties), and noble gases (inert). Compounds are formed by chemical combination of two or more elements in a fixed ratio. Mixtures are physical combinations of substances with variable composition. Mixtures can be homogeneous (uniform, like solutions) or heterogeneous (non-uniform). Various methods like filtration, evaporation, distillation, and chromatography are used to separate mixtures.",

Distillation is the most complex as it involves boiling the liquid components and collecting the vapor to separate them.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "This order is incorrect. Handpicking is the simplest method as it involves physically separating the components of a mixture by hand. Filtration is more complex as it uses a filter to separate a solid from a liquid. Distillation is the most complex as it involves boiling the liquid components and collecting the vapor to separate them. The correct order from simplest to most complex is Handpicking, Filtration, and Distillation."

This is because the free movement of electrons, which enables electrical conduction, is highest in Silver, followed by Copper and then Iron.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Iron, Copper, Silver. This is because Iron has the lowest conductivity among the three metals, followed by Copper and then Silver. The conductivity of a metal depends on the ease with which the electrons in the metal can move, and Silver has the highest number of free electrons, making it the best conductor."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Colloid, Suspension, True solution. This is wrong because a colloid has smaller particles than a suspension, and is more evenly distributed. A true solution is the most uniform with the smallest particles that are completely mixed."
