    "text": "Matter is classified into pure substances and mixtures. Pure substances have fixed composition and definite properties. Elements are the simplest pure substances that cannot be broken down into simpler substances. Elements are classified as metals (lustrous, malleable, ductile, conductors), non-metals (dull, brittle, insulators), metalloids (intermediate properties), and noble gases (inert). Compounds are formed by chemical combination of two or more elements in a fixed ratio. Mixtures are physical combinations of substances with variable composition. Mixtures can be homogeneous (uniform, like solutions) or heterogeneous (non-uniform). Various methods like filtration, evaporation, distillation, and chromatography are used to separate mixtures.",
    "rules": [
      "Elements cannot be broken down into simpler substances.",
      "Metals: lustrous, malleable, ductile, good conductors",
      "Non-metals: dull, brittle, poor conductors",
      "Metalloids: properties between metals and non-metals",
      "Noble gases: chemically inert, exist as single atoms",
      "Compounds: chemical combination, fixed ratio, different properties from elements",
      "Mixtures: physical combination, variable ratio, retain individual properties",
      "Homogeneous mixture: uniform composition (solutions)",
      "Heterogeneous mixture: non-uniform composition (suspensions)"
