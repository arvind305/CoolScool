    "text": "Atoms are the smallest particles of an element that retain its chemical properties. Dalton's atomic theory stated that atoms are indivisible, but later discoveries showed atoms contain subatomic particles. Electrons (negative charge, discovered by J.J. Thomson) orbit the nucleus. Protons (positive charge) and neutrons (no charge) are in the nucleus. Thomson's plum pudding model showed electrons embedded in positive matter. Rutherford's gold foil experiment led to the nuclear model with a small, dense, positive nucleus. Bohr's model introduced fixed energy levels (K, L, M, N shells). Atomic number (Z) equals protons, mass number (A) equals protons plus neutrons. Isotopes are atoms of the same element with different mass numbers.",

The K shell can hold a maximum of 2 electrons, the L shell can hold a maximum of 8 electrons, and the M shell can hold a maximum of 18 electrons.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be M shell (18), K shell (2), L shell (8). This is wrong because the maximum capacity of each shell should increase as you move further from the nucleus. The M shell has the highest capacity, followed by the L shell and then the K shell."

This is not the correct chronological order because the electron was discovered by Thomson before the nucleus was discovered by Rutherford, and the neutron was discovered by Chadwick later than both of these earlier discoveries."

This would result in the order Protium, Tritium, Deuterium, which is wrong because the mass numbers are not in ascending order. The mass number, not the number of protons, determines the order of isotopes."
