    "text": "Atoms are the smallest particles of an element that retain its chemical properties. Dalton's atomic theory stated that atoms are indivisible, but later discoveries showed atoms contain subatomic particles. Electrons (negative charge, discovered by J.J. Thomson) orbit the nucleus. Protons (positive charge) and neutrons (no charge) are in the nucleus. Thomson's plum pudding model showed electrons embedded in positive matter. Rutherford's gold foil experiment led to the nuclear model with a small, dense, positive nucleus. Bohr's model introduced fixed energy levels (K, L, M, N shells). Atomic number (Z) equals protons, mass number (A) equals protons plus neutrons. Isotopes are atoms of the same element with different mass numbers.",

This is because the formula for the maximum number of electrons in a shell is not just a linear relationship with the shell number.
