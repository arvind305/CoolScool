    "text": "Valency is the combining capacity of an element, determined by the number of electrons an atom can lose, gain, or share to achieve a stable configuration. For metals (groups 1-3), valency equals the number of valence electrons. For non-metals (groups 5-7), valency equals 8 minus valence electrons. Some elements show variable valency, like iron (2, 3) and copper (1, 2). Ions are charged particles formed when atoms gain or lose electrons. Cations are positive ions formed when atoms lose electrons. Anions are negative ions formed when atoms gain electrons. Compound ions (radicals) are groups of atoms carrying a charge, like sulfate (SO4 2-) and nitrate (NO3-).",

      "Valency = combining capacity of an element",
      "For metals: valency = number of valence electrons",
      "For non-metals: valency = 8 - valence electrons",
      "Variable valency: some elements have multiple valencies (Fe: 2,3; Cu: 1,2)",

The valency of potassium is 1 because it is an alkali metal in group 1 of the periodic table, and alkali metals have a valency of 1 as they have 1 electron in their outermost shell that they can easily lose to become more stable. Potassium does not have a valency of 2 or 3, as those would be the valencies of elements in groups 2 or 3 respectively."
