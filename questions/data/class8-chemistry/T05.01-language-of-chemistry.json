    "text": "Chemistry uses symbols, formulas, and equations to represent elements, compounds, and reactions. Elements are represented by one or two letter symbols (H, He, Na, Fe). Some symbols come from Latin names (Fe from Ferrum, Na from Natrium). Molecular formulas show the type and number of atoms in a compound. The cross-multiplication method uses valencies to write formulas. Chemical equations represent reactions using symbols. Word equations describe reactions in words. Balanced equations have equal numbers of each type of atom on both sides, following the law of conservation of mass.",
