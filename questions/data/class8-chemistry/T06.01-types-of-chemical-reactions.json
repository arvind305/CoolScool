    "text": "Chemical reactions are classified based on how reactants combine to form products. Combination reactions: two or more substances combine to form one product (A + B -> AB). Decomposition reactions: one compound breaks down into simpler substances (AB -> A + B). Decomposition can be thermal, electrolytic, or photolytic. Displacement reactions: a more reactive element replaces a less reactive one. The reactivity series helps predict displacement reactions. Double displacement reactions: two compounds exchange ions. Neutralization is acid + base -> salt + water. Exothermic reactions release heat; endothermic reactions absorb heat.",

        "Neutralization",
        "Rusting"
      ],
      "explanation_correct": "Combustion reactions release the most heat, followed by neutralization reactions, and then rusting which releases the least amount of heat. This is because the chemical bonds formed in combustion and neutralization reactions are stronger and more stable compared to the bonds formed in the rusting process.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct order from most to least heat released is Combustion, Neutralization, Rusting. Combustion is the most exothermic (heat-releasing) reaction, as a lot of energy is released when the fuel burns. Neutralization, where an acid and a base react to form a salt and water, also releases a significant amount of heat. Rusting, which is the oxidation of iron, releases the least amount of heat among these three processes."
