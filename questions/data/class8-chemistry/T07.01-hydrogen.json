    "text": "Hydrogen is the lightest element and the first element in the periodic table. It has three isotopes: protium (no neutron), deuterium (one neutron), and tritium (two neutrons). In the laboratory, hydrogen is prepared by reacting zinc with dilute sulfuric acid: Zn + H2SO4 -> ZnSO4 + H2. It is collected by downward displacement of water. Industrially, hydrogen is produced by the Bosch process or electrolysis of water. Hydrogen is colorless, odorless, tasteless, and the lightest gas. It is highly combustible and burns with a pale blue flame producing water. The 'pop' sound test is used to identify hydrogen. Uses include fuel cells, ammonia manufacture, and hydrogenation of oils.",

      "explanation_correct": "Hydrogen is the lightest element, so it has the lowest density among the three gases. Nitrogen is heavier than hydrogen, and oxygen is the heaviest of the three, so the order from lightest to heaviest is hydrogen, nitrogen, and oxygen.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The order from lightest to heaviest gas is not oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen. Oxygen is actually the heaviest of the three gases, not the lightest. The correct order from lightest to heaviest is hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen because hydrogen is the lightest element, nitrogen is heavier than hydrogen, and oxygen is the heaviest of the three."
