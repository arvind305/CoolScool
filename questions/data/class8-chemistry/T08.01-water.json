    "text": "Water (H2O) is essential for life and covers about 71% of Earth's surface. The water cycle involves evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. Water has unique physical properties: boiling point 100 degrees C, freezing point 0 degrees C, maximum density at 4 degrees C (anomalous expansion). Water is called the universal solvent because it dissolves many substances. Solutions can be saturated, unsaturated, or supersaturated. Water of crystallization is the fixed number of water molecules in a crystal. Hydrated salts contain water of crystallization; anhydrous salts do not. Hard water contains dissolved calcium and magnesium salts; it doesn't lather easily with soap. Hardness can be temporary (removed by boiling) or permanent (removed by chemical methods).",

      "explanation_correct": "The water cycle involves evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. When water from oceans, lakes, and rivers evaporates, it turns into water vapor in the air. This water vapor then condenses to form clouds, and finally falls back to Earth as precipitation like rain or snow.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The water cycle does not just involve evaporation or just precipitation. It is a continuous process where water evaporates, condenses into clouds, and then falls back to Earth as precipitation like rain or snow. Freezing is not part of the water cycle, as that is a separate physical change that can happen to water."

      "explanation_correct": "The unusual behavior of water between 0 degrees C and 4 degrees C is called anomalous expansion because water expands when it freezes, unlike most other substances which contract when they freeze. This is because water molecules are arranged in a special way that takes up more space as a solid (ice) than as a liquid.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'anomalous' expansion. Many people might think the unusual behavior of water is called 'normal' expansion, but this is not correct. 'Anomalous' means 'deviating from what is standard, normal, or expected', which accurately describes the way water expands when freezing, unlike most other substances."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is Sedimentation, Filtration, Chlorination because this is the typical sequence of water purification steps. First, large particles in the water settle down through sedimentation. Then, the water is filtered to remove smaller particles. Finally, chlorine is added to disinfect the water and kill any remaining microorganisms.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Chlorination, Sedimentation, Filtration. This is wrong because chlorination should be the last step, not the first. Chlorine is added to disinfect the water, but it cannot remove large particles or debris. So the water needs to go through sedimentation and filtration first before chlorination."

An unsaturated solution can still dissolve more solute, a saturated solution cannot dissolve any more solute, and a supersaturated solution contains more dissolved solute than a saturated solution.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "An incorrect order would be to put saturated before unsaturated. This is wrong because an unsaturated solution has a lower concentration of dissolved solute compared to a saturated solution. A saturated solution is at the maximum concentration, while an unsaturated solution can still dissolve more solute."
