    "text": "Water (H2O) is essential for life and covers about 71% of Earth's surface. The water cycle involves evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. Water has unique physical properties: boiling point 100 degrees C, freezing point 0 degrees C, maximum density at 4 degrees C (anomalous expansion). Water is called the universal solvent because it dissolves many substances. Solutions can be saturated, unsaturated, or supersaturated. Water of crystallization is the fixed number of water molecules in a crystal. Hydrated salts contain water of crystallization; anhydrous salts do not. Hard water contains dissolved calcium and magnesium salts; it doesn't lather easily with soap. Hardness can be temporary (removed by boiling) or permanent (removed by chemical methods).",

      "explanation_correct": "The water cycle involves evaporation, condensation, and precipitation. When water from oceans, lakes, and rivers evaporates, it turns into water vapor in the air. This water vapor then condenses to form clouds, and finally falls back to Earth as precipitation like rain or snow.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The water cycle does not just involve evaporation or just precipitation. It is a continuous process where water evaporates, condenses into clouds, and then falls back to Earth as precipitation like rain or snow. Freezing is not part of the water cycle, as that is a separate physical change that can happen to water."

This is because water molecules are arranged in a special way that takes up more space as a solid (ice) than as a liquid.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'anomalous' expansion. Many people might think the unusual behavior of water is called 'normal' expansion, but this is not correct. 'Anomalous' means 'deviating from what is standard, normal, or expected', which accurately describes the way water expands when freezing, unlike most other substances."

The white powder absorbs the water molecules and reforms hydrated copper sulfate, turning blue again. This reaction is exothermic, meaning it releases heat, so the test tube feels warm to the touch. This experiment is also used as a test for the presence of water.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The powder does not just dissolve and disappear -- it changes colour back to blue. It does not turn green or release any gas. The reaction is not irreversible; it is a classic example of a reversible reaction. The white anhydrous copper sulfate readily absorbs water to become blue hydrated copper sulfate again, releasing heat in the process."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "The solubility of most solid solutes, including sugar, increases with temperature. When Rohan's cold water became saturated and could not dissolve more sugar, warming the water increases its capacity to dissolve solute. At a higher temperature, the water molecules have more kinetic energy and can accommodate more sugar molecules, allowing the undissolved sugar to dissolve.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Warming water does not change the taste of sugar. Sugar does not evaporate in warm water. Warm water does not break sugar into invisible pieces -- it actually dissolves the sugar molecules at the molecular level. The correct reason is that solubility increases with temperature for most solid solutes."

By first removing particles through sedimentation and filtration, the chlorine added at the end can effectively kill the remaining microorganisms.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The reason is not about cost. Chlorine does not need hot water to work. Chlorine does not remove dirt -- that is the job of sedimentation and filtration. The real reason is that chlorine is a disinfectant meant to kill microorganisms, and it works most effectively when the water has already been cleared of suspended particles and organic matter."

This property makes water an excellent temperature regulator in nature.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The size of water molecules is not the reason for high specific heat capacity. Being colourless or abundant has no connection to heat capacity.

Higher temperature provides water molecules with more kinetic energy to overcome surface tension and escape as vapor. Low humidity means the air is not already saturated with moisture, so it can accept more vapor. Wind carries away the water vapor layer near the surface, maintaining a concentration gradient that drives further evaporation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Wind does not push water underground. The sun does not convert water to ice. While wind can create waves, that is not the main reason evaporation increases.
