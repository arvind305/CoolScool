    "text": "Carbon is a versatile element that exists in different forms called allotropes. Allotropy is the existence of an element in different physical forms with different properties. Crystalline allotropes include diamond, graphite, and fullerene. Diamond has a tetrahedral structure where each carbon is bonded to four others, making it the hardest natural substance and a non-conductor. Graphite has a layered structure with weak forces between layers, making it soft, slippery, and a good conductor. Fullerene (C60) has a spherical cage structure. Amorphous forms include coal (peat, lignite, bituminous, anthracite), coke, charcoal, and lamp black. These forms have various uses in industry and daily life.",

      "explanation_correct": "Allotropy is the existence of an element in different physical forms, which means the element can have different structures and properties. This is the correct answer because carbon has several allotropes like diamond, graphite, and fullerene, which are different physical forms of the same element.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Allotropy does not refer to an element existing in different chemical forms or different colors. It specifically means the element can exist in multiple physical forms with different properties. The correct answer is that allotropy is the existence of an element in different physical forms, not different chemical forms or colors."

      "correct_answer": "Lamp black",
      "explanation_correct": "Lamp black is the amorphous form of carbon used in making printing inks because it is a very fine, black powder made by burning materials like oil or tar in a limited supply of air. This kind of amorphous carbon is ideal for use in printing inks due to its dark black color and fine particle size.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is lamp black, not the other amorphous forms of carbon like coal, coke, or charcoal. Lamp black is specifically used in printing inks because it is a very fine, black powder that can produce a dark, uniform color when used in inks. The other amorphous forms of carbon have different properties and uses, but are not as well-suited for printing inks as lamp black."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is Diamond (ancient), Graphite (1564), and Fullerene (1985) because diamond is the oldest known allotrope of carbon, having been used since ancient times, graphite was discovered in 1564, and fullerene was discovered much later in 1985.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Fullerene (1985), Diamond (ancient), Graphite (1564). This is incorrect because diamond is the oldest allotrope, having been known since ancient times, followed by graphite which was discovered in 1564, and fullerene which was only discovered in 1985. The order should be from the earliest to the latest discovery."
