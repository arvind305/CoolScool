    "text": "Carbon is a versatile element that exists in different forms called allotropes. Allotropy is the existence of an element in different physical forms with different properties. Crystalline allotropes include diamond, graphite, and fullerene. Diamond has a tetrahedral structure where each carbon is bonded to four others, making it the hardest natural substance and a non-conductor. Graphite has a layered structure with weak forces between layers, making it soft, slippery, and a good conductor. Fullerene (C60) has a spherical cage structure. Amorphous forms include coal (peat, lignite, bituminous, anthracite), coke, charcoal, and lamp black. These forms have various uses in industry and daily life.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Allotropy does not refer to an element existing in different chemical forms or different colors. It specifically means the element can exist in multiple physical forms with different properties. The correct answer is that allotropy is the existence of an element in different physical forms, not different chemical forms or colors."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is lamp black, not the other amorphous forms of carbon like coal, coke, or charcoal. Lamp black is specifically used in printing inks because it is a very fine, black powder that can produce a dark, uniform color when used in inks. The other amorphous forms of carbon have different properties and uses, but are not as well-suited for printing inks as lamp black."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "The teacher used charcoal. Charcoal is a porous, black substance obtained by heating wood in the absence of air. It has a very large surface area due to its porous nature, which allows it to adsorb coloured impurities and odours from water. This property makes charcoal an excellent adsorbent for water purification.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Coke is obtained from coal, not wood. Lamp black is a fine powder produced by incomplete combustion of oil, not from wood. Graphite is a crystalline allotrope used in pencils and is not typically used for adsorption. The porous black substance obtained from wood that removes colour from water is charcoal."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "The phenomenon Arjun's teacher described is allotropy. Allotropy is the existence of an element in two or more different physical forms, called allotropes. Carbon exhibits allotropy because it can exist as diamond (extremely hard) and graphite (very soft), among other forms, even though both are made entirely of carbon atoms.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Isomerism refers to compounds with the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements — it applies to compounds, not elements. Polymorphism refers to a compound existing in different crystal forms. Isotopy relates to isotopes (atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons). The correct term for an element existing in different physical forms is allotropy."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "Graphite is the notable exception. Although carbon is a non-metal, and non-metals are generally poor conductors of electricity, graphite is a good conductor. This is because in graphite, each carbon atom bonds to only three others within a layer, leaving one free (delocalised) electron per atom. These free electrons can move through the layers, enabling electrical conduction — a property usually associated with metals.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Diamond does not conduct electricity because all its electrons are used in bonding. Fullerene and charcoal are not known for being good electrical conductors. Graphite is the only allotrope of carbon that conducts electricity, making it the exception to the rule that non-metals are poor conductors."

      "explanation_correct": "Despite being extremely hard, diamond is a poor conductor of electricity. Students often assume that being hard means diamond has strong properties in every way, but hardness and electrical conductivity are different properties. Diamond does not conduct electricity because all four valence electrons of each carbon atom are used in forming covalent bonds, leaving no free electrons to carry electric current.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Diamond is not a good conductor of electricity — this is a common misconception. It is also not soft like graphite and does not have a layered structure. Diamond has a rigid 3D tetrahedral structure where all electrons are involved in bonding. Being hard does not mean a substance conducts electricity; these are independent properties."

Fullerene (C60) has a well-defined, ordered spherical cage structure made of 12 pentagons and 20 hexagons. Charcoal, coke, and lamp black are all amorphous forms of carbon because they lack a definite, repeating arrangement of atoms. Students sometimes confuse fullerene with amorphous forms because it is less well-known than diamond and graphite.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Charcoal (from wood), coke (from coal), and lamp black (from incomplete combustion) are all amorphous forms of carbon with no definite crystalline structure. Fullerene, however, is a crystalline allotrope with a well-defined spherical cage structure of 60 carbon atoms. It belongs to the same category as diamond and graphite — crystalline allotropes."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Diamond is used for cutting and drilling because of its exceptional hardness, which arises from its structure. In diamond, each carbon atom is covalently bonded to four other carbon atoms in a rigid tetrahedral arrangement, forming a strong three-dimensional network. This network of strong covalent bonds makes diamond the hardest natural substance, capable of cutting glass and drilling through rock.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Diamond is not a different element from graphite — both are made of carbon atoms. Transparency does not cause hardness, and price does not determine a material's physical strength. The reason for diamond's hardness lies entirely in its atomic structure: a rigid 3D network of tetrahedral covalent bonds that is extremely difficult to break."

In diamond, each carbon atom bonds to four others in a rigid tetrahedral structure. In graphite, carbon atoms form flat hexagonal layers with weak forces between the layers. This difference in atomic arrangement, not in the element itself, causes their contrasting properties like hardness, conductivity, and appearance.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Diamond and graphite are both composed of carbon atoms — they are not made of different elements. The number of atoms is not the cause of the property differences. Temperature does not determine the inherent structural difference. The correct reason is that the physical properties of allotropes differ because of the different arrangements of the same type of atom."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Charcoal, especially activated charcoal, is preferred for water purification because it has an extremely large surface area due to its highly porous structure. This large surface area allows charcoal to adsorb impurities, colour, and odour from water very effectively. Coke, while also porous, is primarily designed for use as a fuel and reducing agent in metallurgy, and does not have the same degree of porosity suited for adsorption.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Colour is not a factor in water purification ability. Charcoal does not dissolve impurities — it adsorbs them (holds them on its surface). Cost is not the primary reason for choosing charcoal over coke. The real reason is that charcoal's highly porous structure gives it a very large surface area, which is ideal for trapping impurities through adsorption."
