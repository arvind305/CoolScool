    "text": "Carbon is a versatile element that exists in different forms called allotropes. Allotropy is the existence of an element in different physical forms with different properties. Crystalline allotropes include diamond, graphite, and fullerene. Diamond has a tetrahedral structure where each carbon is bonded to four others, making it the hardest natural substance and a non-conductor. Graphite has a layered structure with weak forces between layers, making it soft, slippery, and a good conductor. Fullerene (C₆₀) has a spherical cage structure. Amorphous forms include coal (peat, lignite, bituminous, anthracite), coke, charcoal, and lamp black. These forms have various uses in industry and daily life.",
    "rules": [
      "Allotropy: same element existing in different physical forms",
      "Diamond: tetrahedral structure, hardest, non-conductor, transparent",
      "Graphite: layered structure, soft, conductor, opaque, lubricant",
      "Fullerene (C₆₀): spherical cage structure, 60 carbon atoms",
      "Coal types (increasing carbon): peat < lignite < bituminous < anthracite",
      "Coke: obtained from coal, porous, used in metallurgy",
      "Charcoal: from wood, used for adsorption",
      "Lamp black (soot): from incomplete combustion, used in inks"
