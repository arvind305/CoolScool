    "text": "Carbon dioxide (CO2) is prepared in the laboratory by reacting calcium carbonate with dilute hydrochloric acid: CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + H2O + CO2. CO2 is colorless, odorless, and denser than air. It turns lime water milky (test for CO2). CO2 doesn't support combustion and is used in fire extinguishers. It's essential for photosynthesis. The greenhouse effect is caused by CO2 and other gases trapping heat, leading to global warming. Carbon monoxide (CO) is formed by incomplete combustion of fuels. It's highly toxic because it binds to hemoglobin, preventing oxygen transport. CO is colorless and odorless, making it dangerous.",

      "correct_answer": "warming",
      "explanation_correct": "Increased levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases trap heat from the sun, causing global temperatures to rise. This is known as the greenhouse effect, which leads to global warming.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'warming'. Increased CO2 levels trap heat from the sun, causing global temperatures to rise. This is known as the greenhouse effect, which leads to global warming. The incorrect answer would be something like 'cooling', which is the opposite of what actually happens due to the greenhouse effect caused by excess CO2 in the atmosphere."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is: Add water, Dissolve CO2 under pressure, Seal the bottle. This is because you need to have water present first before dissolving the carbon dioxide gas into it under pressure. Once the CO2 is dissolved, the bottle must be sealed to keep the carbonation from escaping.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Seal the bottle, Dissolve CO2 under pressure, Add water. This is wrong because you cannot dissolve the CO2 gas into the water if the bottle is already sealed. The water has to be added first before the CO2 can be dissolved under pressure, and then the bottle should be sealed to maintain the carbonation."

Carbon monoxide is the most toxic, as it binds strongly to hemoglobin in the blood, preventing oxygen transport and causing poisoning.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct order from least to most toxic is Oxygen, Carbon dioxide, Carbon monoxide. Oxygen is essential for life and not toxic at all. Carbon dioxide is mildly toxic in high concentrations, while carbon monoxide is highly toxic as it prevents oxygen from being transported in the body."
