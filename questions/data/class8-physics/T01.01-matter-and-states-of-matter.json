    "text": "Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. All matter is made up of tiny particles that are constantly in motion. The three main states of matter are solid, liquid, and gas. Solids have a definite shape and volume because their particles are closely packed and vibrate in fixed positions. Liquids have a definite volume but take the shape of their container because their particles can move around each other. Gases have no definite shape or volume and expand to fill their container because their particles move freely and rapidly. Matter can change from one state to another through processes like melting, freezing, evaporation, condensation, and sublimation. These changes occur when energy (usually heat) is added or removed.",

      "Solids have definite shape and volume; particles vibrate in fixed positions.",
      "Liquids have definite volume but no definite shape; particles slide over each other.",
      "Gases have no definite shape or volume; particles move freely at high speeds.",
