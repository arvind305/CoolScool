    "text": "Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. All matter is made up of tiny particles that are constantly in motion. The three main states of matter are solid, liquid, and gas. Solids have a definite shape and volume because their particles are closely packed and vibrate in fixed positions. Liquids have a definite volume but take the shape of their container because their particles can move around each other. Gases have no definite shape or volume and expand to fill their container because their particles move freely and rapidly. Matter can change from one state to another through processes like melting, freezing, evaporation, condensation, and sublimation. These changes occur when energy (usually heat) is added or removed.",

The naphthalene particles have enough energy to escape the solid form and turn into a gas, making the balls become smaller over time.",

Melting is the process of a solid turning into a liquid, evaporation is a liquid turning into a gas, and condensation is a gas turning into a liquid.

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is 'Ice heating up', 'Ice melting', 'Water heating up', 'Water boiling' because as the ice at -20°C is heated, it first warms up, then melts into liquid water, then the liquid water heats up, and finally the water boils to become steam at 120°C.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be 'Water heating up', 'Ice melting', 'Ice heating up', 'Water boiling'. This is wrong because the ice must first heat up before it can melt, and the liquid water must heat up before it can boil into steam. The correct order follows the gradual increase in temperature and change of state from solid ice to liquid water to gaseous steam."

      ],
      "explanation_correct": "Solids have the least compressibility because their particles are closely packed and cannot be compressed easily. Liquids have more compressibility than solids but less than gases, as their particles can move around each other a bit. Gases have the highest compressibility as their particles move freely and can be squeezed into a smaller space.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct order of states of matter from least to most compressible is solid, liquid, gas. This is because the particles in a solid are tightly packed together and cannot be compressed much, while the particles in a gas can be squeezed into a smaller space. The particles in a liquid have more space between them compared to a solid, but are still more compact than a gas, making liquids more compressible than solids but less compressible than gases."
