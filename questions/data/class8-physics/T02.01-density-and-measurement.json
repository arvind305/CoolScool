    "text": "Density is the mass per unit volume of a substance. It tells us how compact or closely packed the particles of a substance are. The formula for density is Density = Mass / Volume. The SI unit of density is kilogram per cubic meter (kg/m³), though g/cm³ is also commonly used. To find the volume of regular solids, we use mathematical formulas. For irregular solids, we use the water displacement method where the volume of water displaced equals the volume of the object. Relative density (or specific gravity) is the ratio of the density of a substance to the density of water. It has no units because it is a ratio of two densities.",

According to Archimedes' principle, the weight of the volume of water displaced by the floating object is equal to the weight of the object. Since the weight of the object is equal to its mass multiplied by the acceleration due to gravity, the density of the wood must be half the density of water, which is 1 g/cm³.",

Whether you have a small piece or a large block of iron, the density remains 7.8 g/cm³. Mass, volume, and weight are all extensive properties that change depending on how much of the substance you have.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Mass, volume, and weight all increase when you take a larger sample of a substance, so they are extensive properties. Density, however, is the ratio of mass to volume, and this ratio remains constant regardless of sample size. Therefore, density is the property described in the question."
