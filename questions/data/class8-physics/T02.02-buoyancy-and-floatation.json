    "text": "Buoyancy is the upward force exerted by a fluid on any object placed in it. This upward force is called upthrust or buoyant force. Archimedes' principle states that when an object is immersed in a fluid, it experiences an upward force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. An object floats if its density is less than the density of the fluid, and sinks if its density is greater. Ships float because they are designed to displace a large volume of water, making their average density less than water. Submarines can change their density by adjusting the amount of water in their ballast tanks.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 'fluid'. The upthrust is not equal to the weight of the object itself, but rather the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.

In a denser fluid like mercury, a smaller fraction of the block needs to be submerged to displace enough fluid weight to support the block.

Since the stone displaces the same volume in both liquids but salt solution is denser (1.2 g/cm cubed vs 1 g/cm cubed), the weight of displaced salt solution is greater, leading to a greater upthrust and greater apparent weight loss.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Though the stone has the same volume in both liquids, the buoyant force depends on both the volume displaced and the density of the fluid.
