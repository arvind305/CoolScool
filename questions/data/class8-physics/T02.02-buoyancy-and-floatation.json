  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Buoyancy is the upward force exerted by a fluid on any object placed in it. This upward force is called upthrust or buoyant force. Archimedes' principle states that when an object is immersed in a fluid, it experiences an upward force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. An object floats if its density is less than the density of the fluid, and sinks if its density is greater. Ships float because they are designed to displace a large volume of water, making their average density less than water. Submarines can change their density by adjusting the amount of water in their ballast tanks.",
    "rules": [
      "Buoyancy is the upward force exerted by a fluid on an immersed object.",
      "Upthrust = Weight of fluid displaced",
      "Archimedes' principle: Upthrust equals weight of displaced fluid",
      "Object floats if: Density of object < Density of fluid",
      "Object sinks if: Density of object > Density of fluid",
      "Object remains suspended if: Density of object = Density of fluid",
      "Buoyant force depends on volume of object submerged and density of fluid",
      "Ships float due to their hollow design creating low average density",
      "Hydrometers use the principle of floatation to measure liquid density"
