    "text": "Buoyancy is the upward force exerted by a fluid on any object placed in it. This upward force is called upthrust or buoyant force. Archimedes' principle states that when an object is immersed in a fluid, it experiences an upward force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. An object floats if its density is less than the density of the fluid, and sinks if its density is greater. Ships float because they are designed to displace a large volume of water, making their average density less than water. Submarines can change their density by adjusting the amount of water in their ballast tanks.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 'fluid'. The upthrust is not equal to the weight of the object itself, but rather the weight of the fluid displaced by the object.

      "correct_answer": "greater",
      "explanation_correct": "An object will sink if its density is greater than the density of the liquid it is placed in. This is because the upward buoyant force exerted by the liquid is not strong enough to keep the denser object afloat.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 'greater'. An object will sink if its density is greater than the liquid density. This is because the buoyant force acting upwards on the object is not strong enough to counteract the object's weight, causing it to sink. If the object's density is less than the liquid's density, the buoyant force will be greater, allowing the object to float."

      "explanation_correct": "Submarines use ballast tanks to control their buoyancy. Ballast tanks are compartments that can be filled with water or air to change the overall density of the submarine, allowing it to sink or float as needed.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Submarines do not use springs or air pumps to control their buoyancy. The correct answer is 'ballast tanks'. Ballast tanks are compartments that can be filled with water or air, allowing the submarine to change its density and control whether it sinks or floats in the water."

      "correct_answer": "floats",
      "explanation_correct": "When an object floats, the upthrust (buoyant force) on the object is equal to the weight of the object. This is because the object is displacing a volume of fluid equal to its own volume, and the weight of this displaced fluid is equal to the weight of the object, causing the object to float.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "When an object sinks, the upthrust is not equal to the weight of the object. The upthrust is always equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object, but when the object sinks, its weight is greater than the upthrust, causing it to sink. For an object to float, the upthrust must be equal to the weight of the object."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 'lactometer'. A lactometer is a special instrument used to measure the density or purity of milk. It works by detecting how dense the milk is compared to pure water, which allows you to tell if the milk has the right amount of fat and other substances. This is important for ensuring the milk is of good quality before it is sold or used."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'centre of gravity'. The centre of buoyancy is not the centre of mass of the object, but the centre of gravity of the fluid displaced by the object. The centre of gravity of the displaced fluid is the point where the weight of the displaced fluid is concentrated, and this is where the upward buoyant force acts on the object."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Plastic ball (hollow), Wood, Stone. This is wrong because the plastic ball, being hollow, has the lowest density and so floats the best. Wood has a higher density than the plastic ball but lower than stone, so it floats better than stone. Stone has the highest density and will sink the fastest in water."
