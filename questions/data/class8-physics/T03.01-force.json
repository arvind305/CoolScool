    "text": "Force is a push or pull that can change the state of motion or shape of an object. Forces can cause objects to start moving, stop moving, speed up, slow down, or change direction. Forces are classified as contact forces (requiring physical contact like friction, tension, normal force) and non-contact forces (acting at a distance like gravity, magnetic force, electrostatic force). The SI unit of force is Newton (N). When multiple forces act on an object, they can be balanced (no change in motion) or unbalanced (causes change in motion).",

This is why the feather falls more slowly.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Magnetic force and electrostatic force are not relevant in this situation as neither the feather nor the marble is magnetic or electrically charged. While the gravitational force on the feather is indeed less than on the marble (because the feather has less mass), this alone does not explain the difference in falling speed. In a vacuum, both would fall at the same rate. The key difference is air resistance, which opposes the feather's fall much more effectively."

When she stops pedalling, the driving force becomes zero but friction and air resistance still act against the motion. These now become unbalanced forces, producing a net force opposite to the motion. The cycle gradually decelerates and eventually stops.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The cycle will not continue at the same speed because the forces are no longer balanced once Meera stops pedalling.
