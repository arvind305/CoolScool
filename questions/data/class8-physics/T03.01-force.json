    "text": "Force is a push or pull that can change the state of motion or shape of an object. Forces can cause objects to start moving, stop moving, speed up, slow down, or change direction. Forces are classified as contact forces (requiring physical contact like friction, tension, normal force) and non-contact forces (acting at a distance like gravity, magnetic force, electrostatic force). The SI unit of force is Newton (N). When multiple forces act on an object, they can be balanced (no change in motion) or unbalanced (causes change in motion).",

      "question_text": "One Newton equals one kilogram meter per second ___.",
      "correct_answer": "squared",
      "explanation_correct": "The correct answer is 'squared' because the SI unit of force, the Newton (N), is defined as one kilogram meter per second squared (kg⋅m/s²). This means that one Newton is the force required to accelerate a mass of one kilogram by one meter per second, per second.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be 'per second' because the SI unit of force, the Newton (N), is not just kilogram meter per second, but rather kilogram meter per second squared (kg⋅m/s²). This additional 'squared' term is important because it represents the acceleration of the object, which is a key component of the definition of force."

      "explanation_correct": "The 1 kg mass requires the least force to accelerate at 1 m/s², followed by the 5 kg mass, and then the 10 kg mass. This is because force is directly proportional to mass, so a smaller mass needs less force to accelerate at the same rate.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: 10 kg mass, 1 kg mass, 5 kg mass. This is wrong because the 1 kg mass requires the least force to accelerate at 1 m/s², since force is directly proportional to mass. The 10 kg mass would require the most force to accelerate at the same rate."

This is because when the brake pads press against the wheels, it creates a frictional force that opposes the motion of the car. This frictional force then causes the car to come to rest.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Frictional force opposes motion, Car comes to rest, Brake pads press against wheels. This is wrong because the frictional force cannot oppose the motion unless the brake pads first press against the wheels.

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order from bottom to top is: Weight of the book, Normal force from the table, and Air pressure (negligible). The weight of the book is the force exerted by the Earth's gravity on the book, and this acts downward. The normal force from the table acts upward, supporting the weight of the book. The air pressure is negligible compared to the other two forces and can be ignored.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Normal force from the table, Air pressure (negligible), Weight of the book. This is wrong because the normal force from the table is actually the force that supports the weight of the book, and so it must be acting upward to balance the downward weight force. The air pressure is negligible and should not be placed between the weight and the normal force."
