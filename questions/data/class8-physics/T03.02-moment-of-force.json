    "text": "The moment of force (or torque) is the turning effect of a force about a pivot point. It is calculated as the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from the pivot to the line of action of the force. The SI unit is Newton-meter (N·m). Moments can be clockwise or anticlockwise. According to the principle of moments, when a body is in equilibrium, the sum of clockwise moments equals the sum of anticlockwise moments. This principle is used in levers, seesaws, and many tools like spanners and door handles.",

Energy is the capacity to do work, power is the rate of doing work, and momentum is the product of an object's mass and velocity.

The moment of force, or torque, is a measure of the turning effect of a force around a pivot point. It is calculated by multiplying the force (in Newtons) and the perpendicular distance (in meters) from the pivot to the line of action of the force. Therefore, the correct unit is Newton-meter (N·m)."

      "correct_answer": "couple",
      "explanation_correct": "When two equal and opposite parallel forces act on a body, they create a 'couple'. A couple has a turning or rotating effect on the body, but no net force. The sum of the clockwise moments is equal to the sum of the anticlockwise moments, which is the principle of moments.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'couple'. A couple refers to two equal and opposite parallel forces that create a turning or rotating effect on a body, but no net force. This is different from a single force which would just push or pull the body in one direction. The principle of moments states that when a body is in equilibrium, the sum of clockwise moments equals the sum of anticlockwise moments, which is the key concept involved here."

      "correct_answer": "10",
      "explanation_correct": "The moment of force is calculated by multiplying the force (25 N) and the perpendicular distance (0.4 m). So, the moment of force is 25 N × 0.4 m = 10 N·m.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is a single number, 10. The moment of force is calculated by multiplying the force (25 N) and the perpendicular distance (0.4 m). So, the moment of force is 25 N × 0.4 m = 10 N·m. Therefore, the correct answer is 10 N·m."

      "correct_answer": "load",
      "explanation_correct": "In a class 2 lever, the load is placed between the fulcrum (the pivot point) and the effort (the force applied). This arrangement gives a mechanical advantage, allowing a smaller effort to lift a larger load.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The answer 'load' is correct because in a class 2 lever, the load is placed between the fulcrum and the effort. The fulcrum is the fixed point about which the lever rotates, while the effort is the force applied to the lever. The load is the object that needs to be moved or lifted using the lever."

Since the force is 10 N in all cases, the moment will increase as the distance from the pivot increases. Therefore, the order from smallest to largest moment is 0.2 m, 0.5 m, and 1 m from the pivot.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to arrange the distances from largest to smallest, which is 1 m, 0.5 m, and 0.2 m from the pivot. This is wrong because the moment of force is directly proportional to the perpendicular distance from the pivot. A larger distance will produce a larger moment, so the correct order is from smallest to largest distance."
