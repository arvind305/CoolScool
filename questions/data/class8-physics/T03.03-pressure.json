      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The order of pressure at the same depth is determined by the density of the liquid. Mercury has the highest density, so it will experience the greatest pressure at a given depth. Water has a lower density than mercury, so it will experience less pressure. Oil has the lowest density, so it will experience the least pressure at the same depth.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to arrange the liquids from least to most pressure as: Water, Oil, Mercury. This is incorrect because mercury has a higher density than water and oil, so it will experience the greatest pressure at the same depth. Water has a higher density than oil, so it will experience more pressure than oil at the same depth."

      "explanation_correct": "The atmospheric pressure is highest at the top of a mountain, lower at sea level, and lowest at the bottom of a mine. This is because the atmospheric pressure decreases as you go higher in altitude, and increases as you go deeper underground.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Sea level, Top of mountain, Bottom of a mine. This is because the atmospheric pressure is generally higher at sea level compared to the top of a mountain, and it increases as you go deeper underground. The atmospheric pressure is affected by the weight of the air above the measurement point, which decreases with increasing altitude and increases with increasing depth."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is: 1) Driver presses the brake pedal, 2) Pressure is transmitted through the brake fluid, and 3) The brake pads press against the wheel. This is because when the driver presses the pedal, it creates pressure in the fluid, which then pushes the brake pads against the wheel to slow down the vehicle.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: 1) Brake pads press against the wheel, 2) Driver presses the brake pedal, 3) Pressure is transmitted through the brake fluid. This is wrong because the pressure in the brake fluid is created when the driver presses the pedal, and this pressure is then transmitted to the brake pads to make them press against the wheel."

      "explanation_correct": "The pressure exerted on the ground is lowest when you are lying down because your body weight is distributed over a larger area. When standing on both feet, the pressure is higher as the same weight is distributed over a smaller area. The pressure is highest when standing on one foot, as the weight is concentrated on an even smaller area.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The pressure is not highest when standing on one foot. This is because even though the area in contact with the ground is smaller, the force (your body weight) remains the same. So, the pressure will be higher when standing on both feet compared to standing on one foot, since the weight is distributed over a larger area. The lowest pressure is when you are lying down, as your body weight is distributed over the largest area."
