    "text": "In physics, work is done when a force causes displacement of an object. Work = Force × Displacement (in the direction of force). The SI unit of work is Joule (J). Work is positive when force and displacement are in the same direction, negative when opposite, and zero when perpendicular. Energy is the capacity to do work. It exists in various forms including mechanical (kinetic and potential), heat, light, sound, electrical, chemical, and nuclear. Kinetic energy is energy due to motion (KE = ½mv²). Potential energy is energy due to position (PE = mgh for gravitational). The law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed.",
