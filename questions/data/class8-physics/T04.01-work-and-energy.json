    "text": "In physics, work is done when a force causes displacement of an object. Work = Force × Displacement (in the direction of force). The SI unit of work is Joule (J). Work is positive when force and displacement are in the same direction, negative when opposite, and zero when perpendicular. Energy is the capacity to do work. It exists in various forms including mechanical (kinetic and potential), heat, light, sound, electrical, chemical, and nuclear. Kinetic energy is energy due to motion (KE = ½mv²). Potential energy is energy due to position (PE = mgh for gravitational). The law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed.",

      "explanation_correct": "The formula for gravitational potential energy is PE = m × g × h, where h represents the height or vertical displacement of the object. This is because the potential energy of an object is directly proportional to its mass, the acceleration due to gravity, and the height it is raised above the ground.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer format is 'h', as the formula for gravitational potential energy is PE = m × g × h. This means that the potential energy depends on the mass of the object, the acceleration due to gravity, and the height of the object above the ground. The other variables, such as velocity or force, are not part of the formula for gravitational potential energy."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'conservation'. This is because the law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed. It can only change from one form to another, such as from kinetic energy to potential energy. So the word that best fills the blank is 'conservation' to describe this fundamental law of physics."

But if the velocity is halved (v becomes v/2), the kinetic energy will be reduced by a factor of 4 (1/2 * (v/2)^2 = 1/4 * 1/2 * v^2 = 1/8 * m * v^2).

If velocity is doubled (keeping mass constant), KE = 1/2 m(2v)^2 = 1/2 m(4v^2) = 4 x (1/2 mv^2), so KE becomes four times. Velocity has a greater effect on kinetic energy than mass.",

Option C is wrong because conservation of mass deals with the total mass in a chemical reaction remaining constant, not energy transformation. Option D is wrong because the law of inertia (Newton's first law) deals with objects maintaining their state of rest or uniform motion, not with energy changes."
