    "text": "In physics, work is done when a force causes displacement of an object. Work = Force × Displacement (in the direction of force). The SI unit of work is Joule (J). Work is positive when force and displacement are in the same direction, negative when opposite, and zero when perpendicular. Energy is the capacity to do work. It exists in various forms including mechanical (kinetic and potential), heat, light, sound, electrical, chemical, and nuclear. Kinetic energy is energy due to motion (KE = ½mv²). Potential energy is energy due to position (PE = mgh for gravitational). The law of conservation of energy states that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 'potential'. The total mechanical energy of an object is not just its kinetic energy, but the sum of its kinetic energy and potential energy. Potential energy is the energy an object has due to its position or configuration, such as the gravitational potential energy of an object raised above the ground. Therefore, the total mechanical energy equals the kinetic energy plus the potential energy."

      "correct_answer": "elastic",
      "explanation_correct": "The energy stored in a compressed spring is called elastic potential energy. This is because the spring is able to store energy due to its ability to be compressed or stretched, which is a form of elastic potential energy.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The energy stored in a compressed spring is not called gravitational potential energy. Gravitational potential energy is the energy an object has due to its position in a gravitational field, such as being lifted up from the ground. In the case of a compressed spring, the energy is stored due to the spring's ability to be compressed, which is a form of elastic potential energy."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Heat energy produced, Friction acts, Muscular energy used. This is wrong because the muscular energy is used first to create the rubbing motion, which then causes friction, and finally the friction produces the heat energy. The correct order is Muscular energy used, Friction acts, and then Heat energy produced."

      "explanation_correct": "The kinetic energy of an object is directly proportional to its speed squared. So an object moving at 10 m/s has higher kinetic energy than an object moving at 5 m/s, and an object at rest has no kinetic energy.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "An object at rest has no kinetic energy, since it is not moving. An object moving at 5 m/s has less kinetic energy than an object moving at 10 m/s, because kinetic energy depends on the square of the speed. Therefore, the correct order from lowest to highest kinetic energy is: At rest, Moving at 5 m/s, Moving at 10 m/s."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Just after throwing, At half the maximum height, At maximum height. This is incorrect because at the maximum height, the ball is momentarily at rest and has no kinetic energy. As the ball moves upwards, its kinetic energy decreases until it reaches the maximum height, where it is zero. On the way down, the kinetic energy increases again."
