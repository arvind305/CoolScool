    "text": "Power is the rate of doing work or the rate of energy transfer. It is calculated as Power = Work / Time or Power = Energy / Time. The SI unit of power is Watt (W), where 1 Watt = 1 Joule per second. Larger units include kilowatt (kW = 1000 W) and megawatt (MW = 1,000,000 W). The Sun is the primary source of energy on Earth. Energy sources are classified as renewable (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, biomass) and non-renewable (coal, petroleum, natural gas, nuclear). Renewable sources are replenishable and environmentally friendly, while non-renewable sources are limited and often cause pollution.",

Option C) 20,000 W is too high, as it assumes the work is done in 1 second instead of 10 seconds. Option D) 100 W is too low, as it does not use the correct values for weight, height, and time taken."
