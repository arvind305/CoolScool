    "text": "Power is the rate of doing work or the rate of energy transfer. It is calculated as Power = Work / Time or Power = Energy / Time. The SI unit of power is Watt (W), where 1 Watt = 1 Joule per second. Larger units include kilowatt (kW = 1000 W) and megawatt (MW = 1,000,000 W). The Sun is the primary source of energy on Earth. Energy sources are classified as renewable (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, biomass) and non-renewable (coal, petroleum, natural gas, nuclear). Renewable sources are replenishable and environmentally friendly, while non-renewable sources are limited and often cause pollution.",

Option C) 20,000 W is too high, as it assumes the work is done in 1 second instead of 10 seconds. Option D) 100 W is too low, as it does not use the correct values for weight, height, and time taken."

Other types of turbines, such as water turbines or steam turbines, are used to harness energy from different sources, but they are not used to harness energy from the wind."

      "correct_answer": "1000",
      "explanation_correct": "1 kilowatt (kW) is equal to 1000 Watts (W) because the prefix 'kilo' (k) means 'thousand' in the metric system. So, 1 kW is the same as 1000 W, just as 1 kilogram (kg) is equal to 1000 grams (g).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be something like '100 W'. This is wrong because the prefix 'kilo' (k) means 'thousand', so 1 kW is equal to 1000 W, not 100 W. The accepted answer format for this fill-in-the-blank question is a whole number, which in this case is 1000."

      "correct_answer": "light",
      "explanation_correct": "Solar panels convert light energy directly into electrical energy. This is because solar panels are made of materials that can absorb sunlight and generate an electric current, a process called the 'photovoltaic effect'.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 'light'. Solar panels do not convert heat, sound, or motion energy directly into electrical energy. They convert light energy, which is the energy carried by the sun's rays, into electricity through the photovoltaic effect. This allows solar panels to generate clean, renewable electricity from the sun's light."

      "correct_answer": "velocity",
      "explanation_correct": "Power can be expressed as force multiplied by velocity because power is the rate of doing work, and work is equal to force multiplied by the distance traveled. Since velocity is the rate of change of distance, it can be substituted into the power formula to get power equal to force multiplied by velocity.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 'velocity'. The incorrect answer would be something like 'distance' or 'time'. However, power cannot be expressed as force multiplied by distance or time. Power is the rate of doing work, which is the product of force and velocity, not force and distance or force and time."

      "explanation_correct": "The greenhouse effect is enhanced by burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. Fossil fuels release large amounts of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which trap heat and cause global warming.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 'fossil'. The greenhouse effect is caused by the buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and burning fossil fuels is a major contributor to this. Renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydropower do not produce greenhouse gases and therefore do not enhance the greenhouse effect."

Burning wood has been used by humans for thousands of years, while nuclear power started being used in the 1950s, and solar cells became widely available in the late 20th century.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct order is not Nuclear power, Burning wood, Solar cells. Nuclear power is actually newer than burning wood, which has been used by humans for a very long time. Solar cells are the most recent of the three energy sources, becoming widely available only in the late 20th century."

This is wrong because air conditioners generally use the most power, followed by table fans, and LED bulbs have the lowest power consumption.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to have electrical energy generated first, then the rotation of the turbine blades, and lastly the wind kinetic energy. This is incorrect because the wind energy is the primary source that drives the turbine blades to rotate, which then generates the electrical energy.
