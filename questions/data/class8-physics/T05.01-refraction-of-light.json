    "text": "Light travels in straight lines at a speed of approximately 3 × 10⁸ m/s in vacuum. When light passes from one medium to another, it changes speed and may bend. This bending of light is called refraction. Light bends towards the normal when entering a denser medium (slows down) and away from the normal when entering a rarer medium (speeds up). The refractive index is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed in a medium. When light passes through a glass slab, it undergoes lateral displacement. Atmospheric refraction causes phenomena like twinkling of stars, early sunrise/late sunset, and mirages.",

      "explanation_correct": "When light passes through a glass slab, it undergoes lateral displacement because the light bends or refracts as it enters and exits the glass. This causes the light to shift sideways, resulting in a displacement that is parallel to the surface of the glass slab.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'lateral' displacement. When light passes through a glass slab, it does not undergo angular or vertical displacement. Instead, the light bends as it enters and exits the glass, causing it to shift sideways or laterally relative to its original path. This lateral displacement is a key characteristic of refraction through a glass slab."

As light from the stars passes through the Earth's atmosphere, it bends or refracts due to changes in the air density. This refraction causes the apparent position of the stars to change rapidly, making them twinkle or flicker.",

Atmospheric refraction, not other atmospheric effects, is responsible for the twinkling of stars.

The light from different parts of the disc averages out, so the overall brightness stays fairly steady despite atmospheric refraction.",

While some planets do have atmospheres, that is not why they appear steady from Earth; option C is wrong.

      "explanation_correct": "Light from the pebble travels from water (denser medium) into air (rarer medium). When it crosses the boundary, it bends away from the normal. This makes the pebble appear to be at a shallower position than where it actually is. When Riya reached for the apparent position, her hand went to the wrong spot because the real pebble was deeper.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Water does not magnify objects in this situation; the apparent shift in position is due to refraction, not magnification. The pebble was not necessarily moving due to currents; the problem is the apparent position versus real position. Riya's shadow would not cause a shift in apparent position. The correct explanation is that refraction at the water-air boundary makes underwater objects appear raised from their actual position."

This means a lens made of a higher refractive index material can achieve the same degree of light bending (and therefore the same focusing power) with less curvature and less thickness. That is why the lens with refractive index 1.7 can be made thinner than the one with 1.5.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The cost of the material is unrelated to its optical properties, so option B is wrong. The refractive index directly affects how much a lens bends light, so it certainly affects the required thickness (option C is wrong). The thinner lens works at all distances just like the thicker one because both achieve the same focusing power. The correct answer is that a higher refractive index allows more bending per unit thickness."

The Earth's atmosphere acts like a series of layers with decreasing density at higher altitudes. Light from the Sun bends gradually downward as it passes through these layers, making the Sun appear above the horizon even when it is geometrically below it.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "While clouds can scatter light, they do not explain why the Sun itself appears visible after setting. The Sun does not take extra time to set; it has already crossed the horizon geometrically. Jaipur's altitude is not high enough to explain this effect, and this phenomenon occurs everywhere on Earth. The correct explanation is atmospheric refraction bending the Sun's light over the curvature of the Earth."

The angle of incidence at which this occurs is called the critical angle. Arjun has observed the critical angle condition. If he increases the angle of incidence beyond this point, total internal reflection would occur, and no light would pass into the second medium.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Normal refraction would bend the ray into the glass, not along the surface, so option A does not match. Total internal reflection occurs only when the angle exceeds the critical angle, but Arjun has not gone beyond it yet; the ray is still along the boundary. Dispersion requires white light passing through a prism-like shape and is a different phenomenon. Arjun has specifically observed the critical angle condition."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Twinkling of stars occurs because starlight refracts through turbulent atmospheric layers. Early sunrise and delayed sunset happen because the atmosphere bends sunlight over the horizon. Mirages form when light refracts through layers of air at different temperatures.

      "explanation_incorrect": "A denser medium does not attract light like a magnet; there is no magnetic force involved in refraction. The normal is an imaginary reference line and cannot push anything. Light does not try to take the longest path; in fact, Fermat's principle states light takes the path of least time.
