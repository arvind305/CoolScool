    "text": "Light travels in straight lines at a speed of approximately 3 × 10⁸ m/s in vacuum. When light passes from one medium to another, it changes speed and may bend. This bending of light is called refraction. Light bends towards the normal when entering a denser medium (slows down) and away from the normal when entering a rarer medium (speeds up). The refractive index is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed in a medium. When light passes through a glass slab, it undergoes lateral displacement. Atmospheric refraction causes phenomena like twinkling of stars, early sunrise/late sunset, and mirages.",

      "explanation_correct": "When light passes through a glass slab, it undergoes lateral displacement because the light bends or refracts as it enters and exits the glass. This causes the light to shift sideways, resulting in a displacement that is parallel to the surface of the glass slab.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'lateral' displacement. When light passes through a glass slab, it does not undergo angular or vertical displacement. Instead, the light bends as it enters and exits the glass, causing it to shift sideways or laterally relative to its original path. This lateral displacement is a key characteristic of refraction through a glass slab."

As light from the stars passes through the Earth's atmosphere, it bends or refracts due to changes in the air density. This refraction causes the apparent position of the stars to change rapidly, making them twinkle or flicker.",

Atmospheric refraction, not other atmospheric effects, is responsible for the twinkling of stars.

      "correct_answer": "2.42",
      "explanation_correct": "Diamond has a high refractive index of about 2.42. This means that light travels about 2.42 times slower in diamond compared to in a vacuum. Diamond's high refractive index is why it has a shiny, sparkling appearance and is able to disperse light into its component colors.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The refractive index of diamond is not 1.42, but rather around 2.42. This means that light travels about 2.42 times slower in diamond compared to in a vacuum. The high refractive index of diamond is what gives it its shiny, sparkling appearance and ability to disperse light into its component colors."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The angle between the incident ray and the normal is called the angle of incidence, not the angle of refraction. The angle of refraction is the angle between the refracted ray and the normal when light passes from one medium to another. The accepted answer format for this fill-in-the-blank question is 'refraction'."

      "explanation_correct": "The Sun is visible about 2 minutes after sunset due to atmospheric refraction. As the Sun sets, the light from the Sun bends or refracts as it passes through the Earth's atmosphere, which causes the Sun to appear above the horizon even after it has actually set.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The Sun is not visible 2 minutes before sunset due to atmospheric refraction. The correct answer is that the Sun is visible about 2 minutes after sunset. This is because the light from the Sun bends or refracts as it passes through the Earth's atmosphere, causing the Sun to appear above the horizon even after it has actually set."

      "explanation_correct": "The refractive index of a medium is the ratio of the speed of light in vacuum to the speed of light in that medium. Air has the lowest refractive index, followed by water, and diamond has the highest refractive index. This is because light travels fastest in air, slower in water, and slowest in diamond, so the order from lowest to highest refractive index is air, water, diamond.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Diamond, Air, Water. This is wrong because diamond has the highest refractive index, not the lowest. Air has the lowest refractive index, followed by water, and then diamond. The refractive index is a measure of how much the speed of light is reduced when it travels through a medium, and it is always greater than 1."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order of events for the twinkling of stars is: Starlight enters Earth's atmosphere, Light passes through layers of different densities, Light appears to shift position slightly. This is because the starlight has to pass through the Earth's atmosphere, which has layers of varying air densities. As the light passes through these different density layers, it bends or refracts, causing the star to appear to shift position slightly, creating the twinkling effect.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Light appears to shift position slightly, Starlight enters Earth's atmosphere, Light passes through layers of different densities. This is wrong because the twinkling effect is caused by the starlight passing through the Earth's atmosphere, which has layers of varying air densities. The light bends or refracts as it passes through these different density layers, causing the star to appear to shift position slightly. The twinkling effect cannot happen before the starlight enters the Earth's atmosphere and passes through the different density layers."

      "explanation_correct": "The apparent depth of an object decreases as the refractive index of the medium increases. Glass has a higher refractive index than water, and air has the lowest refractive index. Therefore, the order from greatest to least apparent depth is: Object in glass, Object in water, Object in air.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "A common misconception is that the apparent depth of an object depends only on the depth of the medium, not the refractive index. However, the refractive index of the medium also plays a crucial role. The higher the refractive index, the more the light bends, making the object appear closer to the surface. So the correct order from greatest to least apparent depth is: Object in glass, Object in water, Object in air."
