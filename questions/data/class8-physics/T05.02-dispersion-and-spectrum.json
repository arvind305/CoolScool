    "text": "Dispersion is the splitting of white light into its constituent colors when passing through a prism. This happens because different colors of light have different speeds in glass and thus bend by different amounts. The band of colors formed is called a spectrum. The colors in order are Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red (VIBGYOR). Violet bends the most and red bends the least. Newton demonstrated this using a prism experiment. Rainbows are natural examples of dispersion, formed when sunlight is dispersed by water droplets in the atmosphere.",

This happens because the different colors of light have different speeds in the glass of a prism, causing them to bend by different amounts. Dispersion is also not the bouncing or absorption of light, but the separation of white light into a spectrum."

The light does not bend when entering or leaving the prism because the speed of light is the same in both media. Without refraction, there is no dispersion, so the white light passes straight through without splitting into colors.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Dispersion requires a difference in refractive index between the prism and its surroundings. If both have the same refractive index, the light effectively does not 'see' the prism boundary. It will not form a spectrum, will not selectively pass only violet, and will not be absorbed. The beam simply continues in a straight line."

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "Meera is correct. Each water droplet acts like a tiny prism. When sunlight enters a droplet, it slows down and refracts. Because different colors have different speeds in water, the light disperses into its component colors. The colored light then undergoes internal reflection at the back of the droplet and exits, reaching Rohan's eyes as a spectrum of colors forming the rainbow.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Water droplets do not merely reflect light without splitting it, nor do they absorb and release selected colors. Mist does not block sunlight to create artificial colors. The correct explanation is that each droplet refracts the entering sunlight, disperses it into the VIBGYOR colors, and internally reflects it back towards the observer, just like a prism disperses white light."

Since dispersion requires multiple wavelengths travelling at different speeds in glass, a single-wavelength light cannot be split further. Arjun will see only a yellow spot on the screen that is slightly displaced from its original path due to refraction, but no spectrum will form.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "A full VIBGYOR spectrum only forms when polychromatic (white) light passes through a prism. Monochromatic yellow light from a sodium lamp has only one wavelength, so there is nothing to separate. The prism will still refract (bend) the yellow light, but it cannot disperse it into multiple colors. Therefore, Arjun will see only a displaced yellow spot."

      "explanation_incorrect": "A glass prism, water droplets, and cut diamonds all cause visible dispersion because their surfaces are non-parallel, allowing different colors to exit at different angles.

The difference in speed between various colors in glass is the fundamental reason for dispersion.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Light does not have weight, so 'heavier' does not apply. Glass does not absorb red light or have special coatings for bending violet.

The net effect is that all colors emerge parallel to each other and recombine, so no visible spectrum is observed. The light only shifts laterally without splitting into colors.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "It is not that the slab is too thin, or that it lacks a refractive index, or that it filters colors. Glass slabs do refract light and have a refractive index.
