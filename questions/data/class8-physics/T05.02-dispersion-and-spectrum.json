  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Dispersion is the splitting of white light into its constituent colors when passing through a prism. This happens because different colors of light have different speeds in glass and thus bend by different amounts. The band of colors formed is called a spectrum. The colors in order are Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red (VIBGYOR). Violet bends the most and red bends the least. Newton demonstrated this using a prism experiment. Rainbows are natural examples of dispersion, formed when sunlight is dispersed by water droplets in the atmosphere.",

      "Dispersion is the splitting of white light into colors.",
      "White light consists of seven colors: VIBGYOR.",

      "Rainbow is formed by dispersion of sunlight by water droplets.",
      "Primary rainbow has red on outside, violet on inside.",
      "Recombining all colors gives white light."
