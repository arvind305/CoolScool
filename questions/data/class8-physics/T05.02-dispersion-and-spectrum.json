    "text": "Dispersion is the splitting of white light into its constituent colors when passing through a prism. This happens because different colors of light have different speeds in glass and thus bend by different amounts. The band of colors formed is called a spectrum. The colors in order are Violet, Indigo, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red (VIBGYOR). Violet bends the most and red bends the least. Newton demonstrated this using a prism experiment. Rainbows are natural examples of dispersion, formed when sunlight is dispersed by water droplets in the atmosphere.",

This happens because the different colors of light have different speeds in the glass of a prism, causing them to bend by different amounts. Dispersion is also not the bouncing or absorption of light, but the separation of white light into a spectrum."

When sunlight passes through water droplets, it is split into its different colors, just like when it passes through a prism, forming the colorful arc of a rainbow.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 'rainbow'. A rainbow is formed when sunlight is dispersed by water droplets in the atmosphere, creating the colorful spectrum of VIBGYOR. This happens because the different colors of light have different speeds in water, causing them to bend by different amounts, just like in a prism. Therefore, a rainbow is the natural example of dispersion of sunlight."

      "explanation_correct": "Violet has the highest frequency, followed by yellow, and then red has the lowest frequency. This is because violet light bends the most when passing through a prism, while red light bends the least. The order of the colors in the spectrum is VIBGYOR, with violet having the highest frequency.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The order from highest to lowest frequency is not correct. Violet has the highest frequency, followed by yellow, and then red has the lowest frequency. This is because the wavelength of light and its frequency are inversely related - the shorter the wavelength, the higher the frequency. In the visible spectrum, violet light has the shortest wavelength and thus the highest frequency."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is: Sunlight enters water droplet, Colors separate (dispersion), Internal reflection occurs, Light exits droplet. This is because when sunlight enters the water droplet, it gets dispersed into its different colors. Then, the light undergoes internal reflection within the droplet, before finally exiting the droplet, resulting in the formation of a rainbow.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Colors separate (dispersion), Sunlight enters water droplet, Internal reflection occurs, Light exits droplet. This is wrong because the dispersion of light into its colors can only happen after the sunlight has entered the water droplet. The internal reflection and the final exit of light from the droplet are the subsequent steps in the formation of a rainbow."
