    "text": "Spherical mirrors are curved mirrors that form part of a sphere. There are two types: concave mirrors (reflecting surface curves inward) and convex mirrors (reflecting surface curves outward). Key terms include pole (P) - center of mirror surface, center of curvature (C) - center of the sphere, radius of curvature (R), principal axis, principal focus (F), and focal length (f). For spherical mirrors, R = 2f. Concave mirrors can form real or virtual images depending on object position, while convex mirrors always form virtual, erect, and diminished images. Concave mirrors are used in shaving mirrors and torches, while convex mirrors are used in vehicle rear-view mirrors.",
