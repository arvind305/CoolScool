    "text": "Spherical mirrors are curved mirrors that form part of a sphere. There are two types: concave mirrors (reflecting surface curves inward) and convex mirrors (reflecting surface curves outward). Key terms include pole (P) - center of mirror surface, center of curvature (C) - center of the sphere, radius of curvature (R), principal axis, principal focus (F), and focal length (f). For spherical mirrors, R = 2f. Concave mirrors can form real or virtual images depending on object position, while convex mirrors always form virtual, erect, and diminished images. Concave mirrors are used in shaving mirrors and torches, while convex mirrors are used in vehicle rear-view mirrors.",

This is wrong because as the object moves closer to the mirror, the image size increases.

This is wrong because the center of curvature is the farthest from the mirror, followed by the pole which is the center of the mirror, and then the focus which is where light rays converge and is closest to the mirror."

A concave mirror has the narrowest field of view because it reflects light from a smaller area, a plane mirror has a wider field of view, and a convex mirror has the widest field of view as it reflects light from a larger area. This is because the curved surface of a convex mirror allows it to capture a wider angle of view compared to a flat plane mirror or a concave mirror."
