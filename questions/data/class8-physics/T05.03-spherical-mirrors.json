    "text": "Spherical mirrors are curved mirrors that form part of a sphere. There are two types: concave mirrors (reflecting surface curves inward) and convex mirrors (reflecting surface curves outward). Key terms include pole (P) - center of mirror surface, center of curvature (C) - center of the sphere, radius of curvature (R), principal axis, principal focus (F), and focal length (f). For spherical mirrors, R = 2f. Concave mirrors can form real or virtual images depending on object position, while convex mirrors always form virtual, erect, and diminished images. Concave mirrors are used in shaving mirrors and torches, while convex mirrors are used in vehicle rear-view mirrors.",

Concave mirrors are not used in vehicle rear-view mirrors because they make objects appear larger and closer than they actually are, which can be misleading for the driver.

When the tooth is positioned very close to the mirror — between the pole (P) and the focus (F) — the concave mirror produces a virtual, erect, and magnified image. This allows the dentist to see an enlarged view of the teeth for detailed examination. The mirror works because at this close range, reflected rays diverge and appear to come from a larger image behind the mirror.",

Option C is wrong because plane mirrors show same-size images, which would not help a dentist see fine details. Option D gives the wrong reason — an object beyond C would form a diminished image, not a magnified one. The correct explanation is that the tooth is between P and F of a concave mirror."

For a concave mirror, when the object is between F and C, the image forms beyond C, is real, inverted, and magnified. This matches what Amit observes — an inverted, larger image.

Option B is wrong — the image between F and C forms when the object is beyond C, and that image would be diminished.
