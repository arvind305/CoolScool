    "text": "Heat is a form of energy that flows from a hotter body to a colder body. The SI unit of heat is Joule (J), though calorie is also used (1 calorie = 4.186 J). Heat is different from temperature: heat is the total thermal energy, while temperature measures how hot or cold something is. When heat is added to a substance, it can cause temperature change, state change, or expansion. Thermal expansion is the increase in size of a substance when heated. Solids expand in length (linear), area (superficial), and volume (cubical). Liquids and gases also expand when heated. Water has anomalous expansion - it contracts when heated from 0°C to 4°C and then expands.",

Steel has the lowest coefficient, followed by copper, and then aluminium has the highest coefficient. This means that when heated, aluminium expands the most, followed by copper, and steel expands the least.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct order from lowest to highest coefficient of linear expansion is steel, copper, aluminium. This is because steel has tightly packed atoms that don't move apart as much when heated, so it has the lowest expansion. Copper has a moderately high expansion, and aluminium has the highest expansion due to its loosely packed atoms that can move apart more easily when heated."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct order from least to most dense is: Water at 0°C, Water at 4°C, Water at 20°C. This is because water has an anomalous expansion behavior - it contracts when heated from 0°C to 4°C, and then it expands when heated further. The water at 4°C is the least dense, not the most dense."

This is wrong because the length of the metal rod only increases after the particles have started vibrating more due to the absorption of heat energy. The vibration of particles is the first step that leads to the expansion and increase in length of the metal rod."

This is because linear expansion is the increase in length, superficial expansion is the increase in area (which depends on the square of the length), and cubical expansion is the increase in volume (which depends on the cube of the length). So for the same temperature rise, cubical expansion will be the largest, followed by superficial and then linear expansion.",

This is not correct because superficial expansion depends on the square of the length, while linear expansion only depends on the length itself. So for the same temperature rise, the linear expansion would be smaller than the superficial expansion. The correct order from smallest to largest is Linear, Superficial, Cubical."
