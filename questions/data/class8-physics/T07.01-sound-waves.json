    "text": "Sound is a form of energy produced by vibrating objects. Sound requires a medium (solid, liquid, or gas) to travel and cannot travel through vacuum. Sound travels fastest in solids, slower in liquids, and slowest in gases. The speed of sound in air is approximately 343 m/s. Sound has three characteristics: loudness (related to amplitude), pitch (related to frequency), and quality/timbre (distinguishes different sources). Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz). Sound waves are longitudinal waves with compressions (high pressure) and rarefactions (low pressure). The relationship between speed, frequency, and wavelength is v = fλ.",

      "explanation_correct": "Sound is produced by vibrating objects because when objects vibrate, they create pressure waves that travel through the surrounding medium, like air, water, or solids. This transfer of energy creates the sound that we hear.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Sound is not produced by light waves, heat, or electricity. These forms of energy can create other types of waves, but they do not directly produce the pressure waves that we perceive as sound. Sound is always created by the vibration of physical objects, which then causes the medium around them to vibrate and transmit the sound waves."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The answer is 'quality' or 'timbre'. The quality or timbre of a sound is what allows us to distinguish between different musical instruments playing the same note. This is because each instrument has a unique way of vibrating and producing sound, which gives it a distinctive tone or character. The other characteristics of sound, such as loudness and pitch, do not distinguish between different instruments playing the same note."

This is because the wavelength (λ) is the distance traveled by one complete cycle of the wave, and it is inversely related to the frequency (f) - the higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is wavelength (λ). The formula for the relationship between velocity (v), frequency (f), and wavelength (λ) is v = f × λ. This means that the velocity of a sound wave is equal to its frequency multiplied by its wavelength. The wavelength, not the frequency, is the missing term in the provided formula."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'vacuum'. Sound cannot travel through a vacuum because there is no medium present. A vacuum is an empty space with no air or any other substance, so there are no particles for the sound waves to travel through.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format for the given question is 0.5 m. If the speed of sound is 340 m/s and the frequency is 680 Hz, then using the formula v = f*λ, we can calculate the wavelength as 340 m/s / 680 Hz = 0.5 m.

      "explanation_correct": "Sound travels faster through solids than through gases. Iron is a solid with tightly packed particles, allowing vibrations to pass very quickly from one particle to the next. Air is a gas with widely spaced particles, so sound travels much slower through it. This is why Priya hears the tapping sound through the iron fence before she hears it through the air.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because although the fence may help transmit the sound, the reason Priya hears it first is the higher speed of sound in iron, not amplification. Option C is incorrect because air does not block sound — it simply transmits it more slowly than a solid. Option D is wrong because the same tapping event produces the sound; it simply reaches Priya at different times through different media."

This makes the surface vibrate with a greater displacement (larger amplitude), which produces a louder sound. Since the pitch does not change, the frequency remains the same. The amplitude is the property that changes — a larger amplitude means a louder sound.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because the frequency determines pitch, and the question states the pitch does not change. Option B is incorrect because wavelength is related to frequency and speed, and since neither changes, the wavelength stays the same. Option D is wrong because the speed of sound in air remains constant at about 343 m/s regardless of how hard the tabla is struck."

Eventually, when most of the air is removed, there is almost no medium left, so the sound cannot reach Arjun.

      "explanation_incorrect": "Option B (1.18 m) would result from dividing incorrectly. Option C (136000 m) comes from multiplying frequency by speed instead of dividing.

Many students mistakenly believe that louder sounds must be higher-pitched, but these are two separate properties.",

Sound speed depends on how efficiently vibrations pass from one particle to the next, which requires particles to be close together.

This is a common misconception — students confuse the speed of individual gas molecules with the speed of sound transmission.",
