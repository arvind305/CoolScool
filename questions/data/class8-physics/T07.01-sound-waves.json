    "text": "Sound is a form of energy produced by vibrating objects. Sound requires a medium (solid, liquid, or gas) to travel and cannot travel through vacuum. Sound travels fastest in solids, slower in liquids, and slowest in gases. The speed of sound in air is approximately 343 m/s. Sound has three characteristics: loudness (related to amplitude), pitch (related to frequency), and quality/timbre (distinguishes different sources). Frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz). Sound waves are longitudinal waves with compressions (high pressure) and rarefactions (low pressure). The relationship between speed, frequency, and wavelength is v = fλ.",

      "explanation_correct": "Sound is produced by vibrating objects because when objects vibrate, they create pressure waves that travel through the surrounding medium, like air, water, or solids. This transfer of energy creates the sound that we hear.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Sound is not produced by light waves, heat, or electricity. These forms of energy can create other types of waves, but they do not directly produce the pressure waves that we perceive as sound. Sound is always created by the vibration of physical objects, which then causes the medium around them to vibrate and transmit the sound waves."

This is because the wavelength (λ) is the distance traveled by one complete cycle of the wave, and it is inversely related to the frequency (f) - the higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is wavelength (λ). The formula for the relationship between velocity (v), frequency (f), and wavelength (λ) is v = f × λ. This means that the velocity of a sound wave is equal to its frequency multiplied by its wavelength. The wavelength, not the frequency, is the missing term in the provided formula."

      "explanation_correct": "The bass drum has the lowest pitch, followed by the human voice, and then the mosquito buzz has the highest pitch. Pitch is determined by the frequency of the sound waves, and lower frequencies correspond to lower pitches.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Mosquito buzz, Human voice, Bass drum. This is incorrect because the mosquito buzz has a higher frequency and thus a higher pitch compared to the human voice and bass drum. The bass drum has the lowest pitch, followed by the human voice, and then the mosquito buzz has the highest pitch."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is: 1) Source vibrates, 2) Compressions and rarefactions form, 3) Sound reaches the listener. This is because the vibrating source creates disturbances in the medium, which then travel as sound waves until they reach the listener's ear.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Compressions and rarefactions form, Sound reaches the listener, Source vibrates. This is incorrect because the source must vibrate first to create the disturbances in the medium, which then travel as sound waves and reach the listener's ear. The compressions and rarefactions form as a result of the source vibrating, not before it."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be 2000 Hz, 500 Hz, 100 Hz. This is incorrect because the pitch of a sound is directly related to its frequency. The higher the frequency, the higher the pitch. So the order should be from the lowest frequency (100 Hz) to the highest frequency (2000 Hz)."
