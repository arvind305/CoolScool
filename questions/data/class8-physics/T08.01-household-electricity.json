    "text": "Household electrical supply in India is alternating current (AC) at 220V. Domestic circuits have three wires: live wire (red/brown), neutral wire (black/blue), and earth wire (green/yellow-green). Appliances are connected in parallel so each gets full voltage and can work independently. Fuses and circuit breakers are safety devices that break the circuit when current exceeds safe limits. Earthing protects users from electric shock by providing a low-resistance path to ground. The electric meter measures energy consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh) or units. Power rating tells how much electrical energy an appliance uses per second.",

Earthing is important in household electrical circuits because it creates a low-resistance path for any leaking current to flow to the ground. This prevents the current from passing through the user's body, which could cause an electric shock. Other electrical safety devices like fuses and circuit breakers do not provide this low-resistance path to the ground."

      "explanation_correct": "The Earth wire is the most important for safety as it provides a low-resistance path to the ground, protecting you from electric shocks if there is a fault in the appliance. The Live wire carries the main electrical current, while the Neutral wire completes the circuit. So the order of importance for safety is Earth, Live, Neutral.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The Live wire is not the most important for safety. While it carries the main electrical current, if there is a fault, the Live wire can give you a dangerous electric shock. The Earth wire is the most important, as it provides a safe path to the ground, protecting you from shocks. The correct order of importance for safety is Earth, Live, Neutral."

      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The correct sequence is: Fault causes metal body to become live, Current flows through earth wire to ground, Fuse blows, circuit breaks. This is because the earth wire provides a low-resistance path for the current to flow to the ground, preventing the user from getting an electric shock. The high current flow then causes the fuse to blow and break the circuit, making the appliance safe.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect sequence would be: Fuse blows, circuit breaks, Fault causes metal body to become live, Current flows through earth wire to ground. This is wrong because the fault needs to occur first, causing the metal body to become live. The current then flows through the earth wire to the ground, before the fuse blows and breaks the circuit. The earth wire is crucial in providing a safe path for the current, preventing electric shock."

      "explanation_correct": "The LED bulb has the lowest power consumption of 10W, followed by the ceiling fan at 75W, and the electric iron has the highest power consumption of 1000W. This is because different electrical appliances require different amounts of electrical power to function.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Ceiling fan (75W), LED bulb (10W), Electric iron (1000W). This is not correct because the electric iron, which is used for heating, requires much more power (1000W) than the ceiling fan (75W) and the LED bulb (10W), which are used for other purposes. The appliances must be arranged from lowest to highest power consumption."
