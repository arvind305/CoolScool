    "text": "Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter. There are two types of charges: positive and negative. Like charges repel and unlike charges attract. Objects can be charged by friction (rubbing), conduction (contact), and induction (nearby charged object). Conductors allow charges to flow through them, while insulators do not. Semiconductors have intermediate properties. An electroscope is used to detect the presence and type of charge. Lightning is a natural phenomenon caused by the buildup and discharge of static electricity in clouds. Lightning conductors protect buildings by providing a safe path for the electric discharge to reach the ground.",
