    "text": "Electric charge is a fundamental property of matter. There are two types of charges: positive and negative. Like charges repel and unlike charges attract. Objects can be charged by friction (rubbing), conduction (contact), and induction (nearby charged object). Conductors allow charges to flow through them, while insulators do not. Semiconductors have intermediate properties. An electroscope is used to detect the presence and type of charge. Lightning is a natural phenomenon caused by the buildup and discharge of static electricity in clouds. Lightning conductors protect buildings by providing a safe path for the electric discharge to reach the ground.",

It consists of two thin gold leaves that move apart when a charged object is brought near, indicating the presence of an electric charge. This makes the gold leaf electroscope a useful tool for detecting and identifying electric charges.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format for this question is 'electroscope'. An electroscope is a device used to detect the presence and type of electric charge. It works by having two thin metal leaves that will move apart when a charged object is brought near, showing that there is an electric charge present. This makes the electroscope a very helpful tool for understanding static electricity."

This is because the buildup of opposite charges in the clouds creates a strong electric field, which eventually leads to the lightning discharge to balance the charges.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: 1) Lightning discharge occurs, 2) Clouds develop opposite charges, 3) Electric field becomes strong enough. This is wrong because the lightning discharge cannot occur before the clouds develop opposite charges and the electric field becomes strong enough. The lightning is caused by the strong electric field, which is created by the separation of charges in the clouds."

Conduction is more complex, involving direct contact between the object and a charged source. Induction is the most complex, where the object is charged by the mere presence of a nearby charged object, without any direct contact.",

This is not correct because Induction is the most complex charging method, requiring only the presence of a nearby charged object, while Friction and Conduction involve more direct contact between the objects.

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "When Amit brings the charged scale near the paper pieces, the scale's charge induces a temporary charge separation in the paper through induction. The side of the paper closer to the scale develops an opposite charge to the scale, creating an attractive force. Since the attracted side is closer, the attractive force is stronger than the repulsive force on the far side, and the paper jumps up and sticks to the scale. This is charging by induction, not friction or conduction.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because the paper was not rubbed against anything, so it was not charged by friction. Option C is wrong because the paper was attracted before touching the scale; the initial attraction happens through induction, not conduction. Option D is incorrect because static electricity and magnetism are different phenomena — the scale does not become magnetic when rubbed."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "When Priya touches the metal disc with her finger, her body acts as a conductor connected to the ground (earthing). The excess charge on the electroscope flows through her body to the earth, neutralising the electroscope. As the charge is lost, the leaves no longer repel each other and collapse back together. This process of removing charge by connecting to the earth through a conductor is called earthing or grounding.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because touching the disc with a finger provides a path for charge to escape, reducing rather than increasing the charge. Option C is wrong because the human body is a conductor and will definitely allow charge to flow away from the electroscope. Option D is incorrect because there is no mechanism to cause vibration; the charge simply dissipates through the body to the ground."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "A lightning strike carries an enormous amount of electrical current in a very short time. A thick copper strip has low resistance and a large cross-sectional area, which allows it to safely conduct this massive current to the ground without overheating or melting. If the strip were too thin, the intense current could cause it to heat up rapidly and melt, failing to protect the building and potentially causing a fire.",

Option C is wrong because the copper strip is not related to waterproofing — that is the job of the building's roof and walls. Option D is incorrect because the thickness of the strip does not affect whether lightning is attracted; the pointed tip at the top serves that purpose."

      "explanation_correct": "When Meera quickly removes her polyester dupatta, friction between the polyester and cotton fabrics causes electrons to transfer from one fabric to the other, building up static charge on both surfaces. The crackling sound and tiny sparks occur when this accumulated static charge discharges through the air. The sparks are small-scale versions of lightning — a sudden flow of charge through the air gap between the two fabrics, briefly ionising the air and producing light and sound.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because the temperature from normal rubbing of fabrics is far too low to cause a fire. Option C is wrong because polyester does not produce its own light; the light comes from the electrical discharge. Option D is incorrect because cotton is actually a poor conductor of electricity, and the phenomenon is caused by static charge buildup from friction, not current generation."

The other three statements are all correct descriptions of charging by friction.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Options A, B, and D are all correct statements about charging by friction.

A charged object can attract an uncharged object through electrostatic induction. The charged object induces a temporary charge separation in the uncharged object, making the near side have an opposite charge and causing attraction. So attraction does not necessarily mean both objects are charged — only one needs to be charged to create an attractive force.",

However, lying flat actually increases your contact area with the ground, which means ground currents from a nearby lightning strike can flow through more of your body. The recommended position is to crouch low with feet together, minimising both your height and ground contact. The other options are all genuinely safe practices.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Options A, C, and D are all safe practices. Staying inside a building (A) provides protection from lightning. Avoiding electrical appliances (C) is wise because lightning can travel through wiring. Crouching low with feet together (D) minimises your height as a target while keeping ground contact area small.

This high concentration of charge at the tip creates a strong electric field that ionises the surrounding air, facilitating a controlled discharge. When a thundercloud approaches, the pointed tip can initiate a discharge path before a full lightning bolt develops, effectively guiding the lightning safely through the conductor and into the ground. A flat or rounded end would not concentrate charge as effectively.",

Both leaves accumulate the same type of charge (negative in this case). Since like charges repel each other, the two leaves push apart and diverge.

When this charged comb is brought near pieces of paper, it induces a charge separation in the paper through induction. The side of the paper closest to the comb develops a positive charge (as electrons in the paper are repelled away), while the far side becomes negative. Since the positive side is closer to the negative comb, the attractive force is stronger than the repulsive force, and the paper is attracted to the comb.",
