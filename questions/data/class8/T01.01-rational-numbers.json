    "text": "Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed in the form p/q, where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0. They include all integers, fractions, and terminating or recurring decimals. Rational numbers possess important properties under various operations: closure (the result of an operation on two rational numbers is always rational), commutativity (order doesn't matter for addition and multiplication), associativity (grouping doesn't matter), and distributivity (multiplication distributes over addition). Every rational number has an additive identity (0) and multiplicative identity (1), as well as an additive inverse (-a for a) and multiplicative inverse (1/a for non-zero a). Rational numbers can be represented on a number line and are densely packed, meaning infinitely many rational numbers exist between any two rational numbers.",
