Given that the Cost Price is Rs. 200 and the Selling Price is Rs. 250, the profit is Rs. 250 - Rs. 200 = Rs. 50. Plugging these values into the formula, we get Profit % = (50/200) x 100 = 25%.",

Option A (20%) is too low, option C (30%) is too high, and option D (40%) is even further from the correct answer.

This is because a 10% increase followed by a 10% decrease does not bring the number back to the original value, but instead results in a smaller number than the original.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 0.6. Many students may think that 60% as a decimal is 60, but this is incorrect. To convert a percentage to a decimal, you need to divide the percentage by 100. So, 60% divided by 100 is 0.6. The accepted answer format for a decimal is a number with one decimal place, which in this case is 0.6."
