When x and y are in inverse proportion, their product (x × y) is always constant, regardless of the specific values of x and y.

We can calculate this by using the given information that 2.5 kg of apples costs Rs. 175. By dividing the total cost by the weight, we get the price per kg, which is Rs. 70.

However, in this case, the relationship between the number of workers and the time taken to finish a task is inverse, meaning that as the number of workers increases, the time taken to finish the task decreases."
