Option C (12) is incorrect because it represents the number of days A would take to complete the entire work, not the fraction of the work A can complete in 1 day. Option D (6) is incorrect because it represents the number of days it would take A to complete half the work, not the fraction of the work A can complete in 1 day."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer choices do not make sense in this context. Option B (15 days) is wrong because that would mean the worker takes the same time to complete half the job as the whole job, which is not logical. Option C (30 days) is wrong because that would mean the worker takes twice as long to complete half the job, which is also illogical. Option D (5 days) is wrong because that would mean the worker can complete half the job in a third of the time it takes to complete the whole job, which is unrealistic."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 1/20. If B can complete a piece of work in 20 days, then B's one day work is 1/20 of the total work.

      "explanation_incorrect": "If a person completes 1/8 of the work in one day, it does not mean they will complete the entire work in 8 days. This is because the work is being completed at a constant rate of 1/8 per day. To complete the entire work, it will take 8 days, as 1/8 of the work is completed each day."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answers are not correct because they do not represent the remaining fraction of work. For example, B) 1/3 is incorrect because A has already completed 1/3 of the work in 6 days, so the remaining work is 2/3.

This is not correct because the combined work rate is not the product of the individual work rates.

So, if A can complete the work in 12 days and B can complete it in 18 days, their combined rate of work is 1/12 + 1/18 = 5/36. Therefore, they can complete the work in 36/5 = 7.2 days.",

B) 15 days is incorrect because it assumes the work will be completed at the slower individual rate of 18 days. C) 6 days is incorrect because it assumes the work will be completed at the faster individual rate of 12 days.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect options are not correct because they do not correctly calculate the number of days it would take 6 men to complete the same job. Option B (9 days) is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that the number of workers has decreased from 8 to 6. Option C (12 days) is incorrect because it assumes that the number of workers does not change the time it takes to complete the job. Option D (18 days) is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the rate at which the job is completed with 6 workers."

This means that as the number of workers increases, the time taken to complete the work decreases, and vice versa. This is because more workers can complete the same amount of work in a shorter period of time.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement is incorrect because in time and work problems, the number of workers and the time taken are directly proportional, not inversely proportional. This means that as the number of workers increases, the time taken to complete the work also increases, and vice versa.

      "explanation_correct": "The correct answer is A) 24 days. Since A and B together can complete the work in 8 days, and A alone can complete it in 12 days, we can find the time it takes for B alone to complete the work using the formula: 1/Time(A+B) = 1/Time(A) + 1/Time(B). Solving for Time(B), we get 24 days.",

These answers do not correctly apply the formula to find the time it takes for B alone to complete the work. The correct formula is 1/Time(A+B) = 1/Time(A) + 1/Time(B), which gives us 24 days for B alone to complete the work."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answers are not correct because they do not follow the inverse relationship between the number of workers and the time taken. If 15 workers can build the wall in 10 days, then the number of workers required to build the same wall in 6 days should be more than 15, which is option A) 25 workers."

So, the time taken to complete the work together will be less than the individual times. Using the formula for combined work rate, the time taken by A and B working together is 12 days.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be if you thought the combined time taken by A and B is the average of their individual times, which is (20 + 30) / 2 = 25 days. However, this is not correct. When they work together, their combined work rate is higher, so the time taken is less than the average of their individual times."

This is incorrect because the filling pipe's work should be considered positive, as it helps fill the cistern, while the emptying pipe's work should be considered negative, as it helps empty the cistern.

      "explanation_correct": "The correct answer is A) 8/3 hours. This is because the three pipes A, B, and C can fill the tank in 6, 8, and 12 hours respectively. When all three are opened together, the rate at which the tank is filled is the sum of the individual rates, which is 1/6 + 1/8 + 1/12 = 3/24 = 1/8 per hour. Therefore, the time taken to fill the tank is 1/8 per hour, or 8/3 hours.",

Option B) 3 hours is wrong because the total rate of the three pipes is not 1/3 per hour. Option C) 4 hours is wrong because the total rate of the three pipes is not 1/4 per hour. Option D) 2 hours is wrong because the total rate of the three pipes is not 1/2 per hour.

So, the combined work rate of A and B is 1/12 + 1/20 = 5/60 per day. After they work together for 8 days, the remaining work is (1 - 8/12) = 1/3 of the total.
