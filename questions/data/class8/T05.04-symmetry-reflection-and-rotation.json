However, the two equal sides of an isosceles triangle create a line of symmetry that passes through the vertex opposite the equal sides and bisects the base. An isosceles triangle does not have multiple lines of symmetry like an equilateral triangle, but it has exactly one line of symmetry."

The angle of rotation that maps the pentagon onto itself for the second time is 360°/5 = 144°. And a regular pentagon has 5 lines of symmetry, one passing through each vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side.",
