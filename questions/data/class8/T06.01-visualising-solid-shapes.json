      "explanation_incorrect": "A pyramid may not be a polyhedron if it has a curved base instead of a flat base.

A pentagonal pyramid has a base with 5 sides (a pentagon) and 5 triangular faces on the sides, so the total number of faces is 6 (the base) + 5 (the triangular faces) = 10 faces. The other options are incorrect because 9 is too low, 12 is too high, and 6 is the number of faces for a triangular pyramid, not a pentagonal pyramid."
