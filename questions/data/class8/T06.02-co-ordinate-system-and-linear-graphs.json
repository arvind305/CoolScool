      "explanation_correct": "The correct answer is A) A straight line passing through the origin with positive slope. This is because the total cost (y) is directly proportional to the number of kg (x) of apples sold, and the graph representing this relationship is a straight line starting from the origin with a positive slope.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The other options are incorrect because: B) A horizontal line would mean the cost is the same regardless of the number of kg, which is not the case here. C) A vertical line would mean the number of kg is the same regardless of the cost, which is also not correct. D) A curved line would indicate a non-linear relationship between the number of kg and the total cost, but in this case, the relationship is linear."

Since it has 100 liters after 5 minutes and 200 liters after 10 minutes, the rate of increase is 20 liters per 5 minutes. Therefore, after 15 minutes, the tank will have 300 liters, which is 275 liters.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option B, 275 liters, is the correct answer. The water tank is being filled at a constant rate, and we can calculate the rate of increase from the given information. Since it has 100 liters after 5 minutes and 200 liters after 10 minutes, the rate of increase is 20 liters per 5 minutes. Multiplying this rate by 3 (since 15 minutes is 3 sets of 5 minutes), we get 60 liters, which added to the 200 liters after 10 minutes gives us 260 liters.
