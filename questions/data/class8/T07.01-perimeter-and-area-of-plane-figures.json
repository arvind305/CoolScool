Option B) ₹420 is incorrect because it does not account for the total perimeter of the triangle. Option C) ₹525 is incorrect because it does not use the correct cost per meter. Option D) ₹350 is incorrect because it does not calculate the total perimeter correctly."

      "explanation_correct": "To find the lengths of the diagonals, we can use the formula for the area of a rhombus: Area = (diagonal 1 × diagonal 2) / 2. Since the area is given as 216 cm² and the diagonals are in the ratio of 2:3, we can solve for the lengths of the diagonals, which are 12√2 cm and 18√2 cm (or 12 cm and 36 cm based on calculation).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to assume that the diagonals are 12 cm and 18 cm, since the ratio is 2:3. However, the formula for the area of a rhombus requires the lengths of the diagonals, not the ratio. The correct answer is 12√2 cm and 18√2 cm (or 12 cm and 36 cm based on calculation). For the cost, the accepted answer format is ₹250, as it is the cost of 50 tiles at ₹5 per tile."
