The bars in a histogram are meant to show the frequency or distribution of the data without any breaks.",

Histograms are used to display continuous data, and the bars are drawn right next to each other without any spaces in between.

This is because a full circle has 360 degrees, and the angle of each sector should represent its proportional size in the data.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 360. A pie chart is a circular diagram divided into sectors, with each sector representing a component of the total data. To calculate the angle of each sector, we use the formula (component value / total value) × 360, as a full circle has 360 degrees. Multiplying by 360 ensures that the angles of all the sectors add up to the total of 360 degrees."
