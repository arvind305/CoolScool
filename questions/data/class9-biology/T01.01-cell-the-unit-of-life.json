    "text": "The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of all living organisms. Cell theory, proposed by Schleiden and Schwann, states that all living organisms are composed of cells, cells are the basic unit of life, and all cells arise from pre-existing cells. Cells are classified as prokaryotic (no true nucleus, e.g., bacteria) and eukaryotic (true nucleus, e.g., plants and animals). The cell membrane is a selectively permeable barrier made of phospholipid bilayer with proteins. Plant cells have an additional cell wall made of cellulose. The nucleus contains genetic material (DNA) and controls cell activities. Cytoplasmic organelles include endoplasmic reticulum (protein and lipid synthesis), Golgi apparatus (packaging and secretion), mitochondria (ATP production), plastids (photosynthesis and storage in plants), vacuoles (storage), lysosomes (digestion), and ribosomes (protein synthesis).",

Hooke and Leeuwenhoek were early microscopists who observed cells, but did not formulate the cell theory.

      "explanation_correct": "The nuclear membrane is the outermost layer surrounding the nucleus. Inside the nuclear membrane is the nucleoplasm, which contains the chromatin or chromosomes. The nucleolus is the innermost structure within the nucleus, where ribosomes are produced.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The components of the nucleus are arranged from outer to inner as: nuclear membrane, nucleoplasm, chromatin/chromosomes, and then the nucleolus. The nuclear membrane is the outermost layer that encloses the nucleus, followed by the nucleoplasm, which is the fluid-like substance within the nucleus. The chromatin/chromosomes, which contain the genetic material, are located within the nucleoplasm, and the nucleolus is the small, dense structure within the nucleus where ribosomes are synthesized."

Prokaryotic cells are the simplest, single-celled organisms without a true nucleus. Eukaryotic cells are more complex, with a true nucleus and organelles. Tissues are groups of similar cells working together, and organs are collections of different tissues with a specific function.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct order is Prokaryotic cell, Eukaryotic cell, Tissue, Organ. Prokaryotic cells are the most basic, single-celled organisms, while Eukaryotic cells are more complex with a true nucleus and organelles. Tissues are groups of similar cells, and organs are collections of different tissues with a specific function. The order goes from the most simple (Prokaryotic cell) to the most complex (Organ)."
