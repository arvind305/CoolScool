    "text": "A tissue is a group of cells with similar structure and function working together. Plant tissues are classified as meristematic (actively dividing) and permanent (differentiated). Meristematic tissues are found at growing tips (apical), sides (lateral), and nodes (intercalary). Permanent tissues include simple tissues (parenchyma - storage and photosynthesis, collenchyma - flexible support, sclerenchyma - rigid support) and complex tissues (xylem - water transport, phloem - food transport). Animal tissues include epithelial (covering and protection), connective (support and binding), muscular (movement), and nervous (impulse transmission). Each tissue type has specialized structures adapted for its function.",
    "rules": [
      "Meristematic tissue consists of actively dividing cells with thin walls and dense cytoplasm",
      "Parenchyma has thin-walled living cells for storage and photosynthesis",
      "Collenchyma has irregularly thickened corners for flexible support",
      "Sclerenchyma has thick lignified walls and is dead at maturity",
      "Xylem transports water upward; phloem transports food bidirectionally",
      "Epithelial tissue covers body surfaces and lines cavities",
      "Connective tissue includes blood, bone, cartilage, and adipose tissue",
      "Skeletal muscle is striated and voluntary; smooth muscle is unstriated and involuntary",
      "Cardiac muscle is striated but involuntary with intercalated discs",
      "Nervous tissue consists of neurons and neuroglia for impulse transmission"

Sclerenchyma cells become dead at maturity because their walls are heavily lignified, which causes the cell contents to disappear.",

Collenchyma cells stay alive at maturity — their walls are thickened at corners but not lignified, allowing them to retain living contents. Sclerenchyma cells die at maturity because the heavy deposition of lignin in their walls causes the protoplasm to be lost. They are not both living, not both dead, and the relationship is not reversed."

      "explanation_correct": "Parenchyma is a simple permanent tissue that remains living at maturity. Its cells have thin walls, active cytoplasm, and perform functions like storage, photosynthesis, and gas exchange. In contrast, sclerenchyma fibres, xylem vessels, and tracheids are all dead at maturity because their walls become heavily lignified.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "It is a common misconception that all permanent tissues are dead because they have stopped dividing. However, 'permanent' only means the cells have lost the ability to divide — it does not mean they are dead. Parenchyma and collenchyma are both living permanent tissues. Sclerenchyma fibres, xylem vessels, and tracheids are dead at maturity due to lignification of their cell walls."

The fact that the matrix is liquid rather than solid does not change its classification. Blood connects different parts of the body by transporting gases, nutrients, hormones, and waste products.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Mucus, saliva, and gastric juice are secretions produced by glandular epithelial cells — they are not tissues. Blood, despite being a fluid, is a true connective tissue because it consists of cells suspended in a matrix (plasma), just as bone has cells in a hard matrix and cartilage has cells in a flexible matrix. The nature of the matrix varies, but the basic plan of cells plus matrix defines connective tissue."

Biceps and thigh muscles are striated and voluntary. Stomach wall muscles are smooth (unstriated) and involuntary.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Biceps and thigh muscles are both skeletal muscles — they are striated and voluntary, fitting the general rule.

Xylem contains four different cell types — vessels, tracheids, xylem parenchyma, and xylem fibres — each contributing to the overall function of water transport and support. This multi-cellular composition is what makes it a complex tissue.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Transporting water over long distances describes the function of xylem but does not define whether a tissue is simple or complex. Having dead cells at maturity is true for some xylem components but not the reason for its classification. Being found in vascular plants is a feature of distribution, not tissue classification. The defining criterion for a complex tissue is that it is composed of more than one type of cell."

      "explanation_correct": "The skin is constantly exposed to friction, abrasion, and physical stress. Stratified squamous epithelium has multiple layers of cells, so even when the outermost layer is damaged or worn away, the deeper layers remain intact and can replace the lost cells. Simple squamous epithelium, with only a single layer of flat cells, would be too thin and fragile to withstand this mechanical stress.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Absorption of nutrients is the function of columnar epithelium with microvilli in the intestine, not stratified epithelium. Rapid diffusion of gases occurs across simple squamous epithelium in the lungs, not stratified epithelium. Enzyme secretion is performed by glandular epithelium. The reason skin has stratified squamous epithelium is specifically that multiple cell layers protect against the mechanical wear and tear that the skin constantly experiences."

      "explanation_correct": "Meristematic cells are specialised for rapid and continuous cell division. Thin cell walls allow the cells to divide quickly without the barrier of a thick, rigid wall. Dense cytoplasm indicates an abundance of organelles such as ribosomes, mitochondria, and endoplasmic reticulum, which are essential for the high metabolic activity and protein synthesis required during active growth and division.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Storage of food is a function of parenchyma, not meristematic tissue. Rigid structural support is provided by sclerenchyma with thick lignified walls — thin walls cannot provide rigidity. Water transport is the function of xylem, not meristematic cells. The actual reason is that thin walls facilitate rapid division and dense cytoplasm provides the metabolic machinery needed for continuous growth."
