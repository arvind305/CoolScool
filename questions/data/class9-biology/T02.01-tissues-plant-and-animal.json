    "text": "A tissue is a group of cells with similar structure and function working together. Plant tissues are classified as meristematic (actively dividing) and permanent (differentiated). Meristematic tissues are found at growing tips (apical), sides (lateral), and nodes (intercalary). Permanent tissues include simple tissues (parenchyma - storage and photosynthesis, collenchyma - flexible support, sclerenchyma - rigid support) and complex tissues (xylem - water transport, phloem - food transport). Animal tissues include epithelial (covering and protection), connective (support and binding), muscular (movement), and nervous (impulse transmission). Each tissue type has specialized structures adapted for its function.",
    "rules": [
      "Meristematic tissue consists of actively dividing cells with thin walls and dense cytoplasm",
      "Parenchyma has thin-walled living cells for storage and photosynthesis",
      "Collenchyma has irregularly thickened corners for flexible support",
      "Sclerenchyma has thick lignified walls and is dead at maturity",
      "Xylem transports water upward; phloem transports food bidirectionally",
      "Epithelial tissue covers body surfaces and lines cavities",
      "Connective tissue includes blood, bone, cartilage, and adipose tissue",
      "Skeletal muscle is striated and voluntary; smooth muscle is unstriated and involuntary",
      "Cardiac muscle is striated but involuntary with intercalated discs",
      "Nervous tissue consists of neurons and neuroglia for impulse transmission"
