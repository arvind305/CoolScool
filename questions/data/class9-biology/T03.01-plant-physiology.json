    "text": "Plant physiology deals with the vital processes in plants. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, producing glucose and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water. It occurs in chloroplasts and involves light reactions (in thylakoids, producing ATP and NADPH) and dark reactions (in stroma, producing glucose). Respiration in plants breaks down glucose to release energy, occurring as aerobic respiration (with oxygen, in mitochondria) or anaerobic respiration (without oxygen, producing alcohol). Transpiration is the loss of water vapor through stomata, which helps in cooling, mineral transport, and maintaining turgor. Stomata are pores bounded by guard cells that regulate gas exchange and water loss.",
    "rules": [
      "Photosynthesis equation: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light -> C6H12O6 + 6O2",

      "Dark reaction (Calvin cycle) occurs in stroma and produces glucose",
      "Factors affecting photosynthesis: light intensity, CO2 concentration, temperature, water",
      "Aerobic respiration produces 36-38 ATP per glucose molecule",
      "Anaerobic respiration in plants produces ethanol and CO2",
      "Transpiration creates transpiration pull for water movement upward",
      "Stomata open when guard cells are turgid and close when flaccid",
      "Stomatal opening is influenced by light, CO2 levels, and water availability",
      "Transpiration is affected by light, temperature, humidity, and wind"
