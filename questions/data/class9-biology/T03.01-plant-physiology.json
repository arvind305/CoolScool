    "text": "Plant physiology deals with the vital processes in plants. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, producing glucose and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water. It occurs in chloroplasts and involves light reactions (in thylakoids, producing ATP and NADPH) and dark reactions (in stroma, producing glucose). Respiration in plants breaks down glucose to release energy, occurring as aerobic respiration (with oxygen, in mitochondria) or anaerobic respiration (without oxygen, producing alcohol). Transpiration is the loss of water vapor through stomata, which helps in cooling, mineral transport, and maintaining turgor. Stomata are pores bounded by guard cells that regulate gas exchange and water loss.",

      "Photosynthesis equation: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light -> C6H12O6 + 6O2",
      "Light reaction occurs in thylakoid membranes and produces ATP, NADPH, and O2",
      "Dark reaction (Calvin cycle) occurs in stroma and produces glucose",
      "Factors affecting photosynthesis: light intensity, CO2 concentration, temperature, water",
      "Aerobic respiration produces 36-38 ATP per glucose molecule",
      "Anaerobic respiration in plants produces ethanol and CO2",
      "Transpiration creates transpiration pull for water movement upward",
      "Stomata open when guard cells are turgid and close when flaccid",
      "Stomatal opening is influenced by light, CO2 levels, and water availability",
      "Transpiration is affected by light, temperature, humidity, and wind"

Aerobic respiration is a much more efficient process that can extract far more energy from glucose compared to anaerobic respiration, which is a less complete process."

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation_correct": "The cuticle is a waxy, impermeable layer on the surface of plants, which reduces the rate of water loss through the cuticle. This means that cuticular transpiration, or water loss through the cuticle, is much less compared to the water lost through the stomata, where the majority of transpiration occurs.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is correct because the cuticle is a waxy, impermeable layer that acts as a barrier to water loss. The other options are incorrect - the cuticle has fewer pores compared to the stomata, is thicker to provide more protection, and covers the entire surface area of the plant, including the leaves, stem, and other organs. Therefore, the cuticle is less permeable to water, resulting in lower cuticular transpiration compared to stomatal transpiration."

This is because aerobic respiration is a more efficient process that fully oxidizes glucose, whereas anaerobic respiration only partially breaks down glucose.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Some students may think that anaerobic respiration produces more ATP than aerobic respiration because it happens faster. However, this is not the case. Aerobic respiration, which uses oxygen, is a much more efficient process that extracts a lot more energy from the same amount of glucose compared to anaerobic respiration, which occurs without oxygen."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Transpiration does not occur equally through the upper and lower surfaces of leaves.

This is not correct because high humidity means the air around the plant already has a lot of water vapor.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be guard cells become turgid, water enters guard cells by osmosis, K+ ions enter guard cells, and then the stomatal pore opens. This is wrong because the increase in K+ ions is the first step that triggers the entry of water by osmosis, which then makes the guard cells turgid and causes the stomatal pore to open."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is Glycolysis in cytoplasm, Krebs cycle in matrix, and Electron transport chain on inner membrane. This is because glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm, the Krebs cycle occurs in the matrix of the mitochondria, and the electron transport chain is located on the inner membrane of the mitochondria.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to place the Krebs cycle before glycolysis. The Krebs cycle actually occurs in the matrix of the mitochondria, while glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm before the Krebs cycle. The electron transport chain is correctly placed on the inner membrane of the mitochondria."
