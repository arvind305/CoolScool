    "text": "Plant physiology deals with the vital processes in plants. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, producing glucose and oxygen from carbon dioxide and water. It occurs in chloroplasts and involves light reactions (in thylakoids, producing ATP and NADPH) and dark reactions (in stroma, producing glucose). Respiration in plants breaks down glucose to release energy, occurring as aerobic respiration (with oxygen, in mitochondria) or anaerobic respiration (without oxygen, producing alcohol). Transpiration is the loss of water vapor through stomata, which helps in cooling, mineral transport, and maintaining turgor. Stomata are pores bounded by guard cells that regulate gas exchange and water loss.",

      "Photosynthesis equation: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light -> C6H12O6 + 6O2",
      "Light reaction occurs in thylakoid membranes and produces ATP, NADPH, and O2",
      "Dark reaction (Calvin cycle) occurs in stroma and produces glucose",
      "Factors affecting photosynthesis: light intensity, CO2 concentration, temperature, water",
      "Aerobic respiration produces 36-38 ATP per glucose molecule",
      "Anaerobic respiration in plants produces ethanol and CO2",
      "Transpiration creates transpiration pull for water movement upward",
      "Stomata open when guard cells are turgid and close when flaccid",
      "Stomatal opening is influenced by light, CO2 levels, and water availability",

This means that cuticular transpiration, or water loss through the cuticle, is much less compared to the water lost through the stomata, where the majority of transpiration occurs.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is correct because the cuticle is a waxy, impermeable layer that acts as a barrier to water loss. The other options are incorrect - the cuticle has fewer pores compared to the stomata, is thicker to provide more protection, and covers the entire surface area of the plant, including the leaves, stem, and other organs. Therefore, the cuticle is less permeable to water, resulting in lower cuticular transpiration compared to stomatal transpiration."

This is because aerobic respiration is a more efficient process that fully oxidizes glucose, whereas anaerobic respiration only partially breaks down glucose.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Some students may think that anaerobic respiration produces more ATP than aerobic respiration because it happens faster. However, this is not the case. Aerobic respiration, which uses oxygen, is a much more efficient process that extracts a lot more energy from the same amount of glucose compared to anaerobic respiration, which occurs without oxygen."

This is not correct because high humidity means the air around the plant already has a lot of water vapor.

      "explanation_correct": "In darkness, photosynthesis in the guard cells stops. Without photosynthesis, the sugar concentration in guard cells decreases, potassium ions move out, and water leaves the guard cells by osmosis. This makes the guard cells flaccid, causing the stomatal pores to close or nearly close. Light is one of the most important factors triggering stomatal opening, so removing light leads to closure.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because darkness causes stomatal closure, not further opening. Option C is wrong because stomata actively respond to environmental changes like light availability. Option D is wrong because the number of stomata on a leaf is fixed during leaf development and does not change within hours. Stomatal aperture (opening size) changes, but the total number of stomata does not."

      "explanation_correct": "The bubbles rising from Hydrilla are oxygen produced during the light reaction of photosynthesis. Adding sodium bicarbonate increases the dissolved CO2 concentration in the water. Since CO2 is a raw material for the dark reaction (Calvin cycle), increasing its availability speeds up carbon fixation in the stroma. This in turn increases the overall rate of photosynthesis, and more oxygen is released as a by-product of the light reaction, resulting in faster bubbling.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because sodium bicarbonate does not directly produce oxygen. Option C is incorrect because adding sodium bicarbonate does not significantly change water temperature. Option D is wrong because the bubbles are oxygen from photosynthesis, not CO2. The increased CO2 acts as additional raw material for the Calvin cycle, boosting the overall photosynthetic rate."

In reality, respiration is a continuous process that occurs 24 hours a day in all living plant cells, including during the daytime when photosynthesis is also occurring. During the day, both photosynthesis and respiration happen simultaneously, but photosynthesis typically produces more oxygen than respiration consumes, giving the appearance that plants only release oxygen.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A reflects the common misconception that respiration only occurs at night. Option C is wrong because all living cells of the plant respire, not just leaves. Option D is incorrect because respiration does not stop during the day; it continues alongside photosynthesis.

However, experiments using isotopic labelling (with heavy oxygen, O-18) have proven that the oxygen released actually comes from the photolysis of water molecules during the light reaction. Water is split into hydrogen ions, electrons, and oxygen gas. The hydrogen is used to reduce NADP+ to NADPH, while the oxygen is released as a by-product.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A reflects the most common misconception -- students assume since CO2 has oxygen atoms, the released O2 must come from CO2. Option B is incorrect because glucose is a product, not a source of released oxygen. Option D is wrong because the oxygen is newly generated from water splitting, not recycled from the atmosphere. This was conclusively demonstrated through isotope tracing experiments."

The most important is creating transpiration pull -- a suction force that draws water and dissolved minerals upward from the roots through the xylem vessels to the leaves. Without transpiration pull, tall trees would not be able to transport water to their uppermost leaves. Transpiration also helps in cooling the plant and maintaining cell turgidity.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A describes an extreme consequence of excessive transpiration, not its normal function. Option C overstates the negative effects; under normal conditions, transpiration does not cause excessive dehydration. Option D is entirely wrong -- transpiration occurs through open stomata and does not block them. Students often focus only on the water loss aspect and miss that transpiration is actually described as a 'necessary evil' because of its essential role in water transport."

Instead, they use the ATP and NADPH that were produced during the light reactions. The term 'dark reaction' is misleading because it does not mean the reaction occurs only in darkness. In fact, the dark reaction mainly occurs during the day when the light reactions are actively supplying ATP and NADPH. Without these products from the light reaction, the Calvin cycle cannot proceed efficiently.",

Option C is incorrect because the dark reaction predominantly occurs during the day, alongside the light reactions that supply its energy requirements.

After glycolysis (which both aerobic and anaerobic share), the pyruvate enters the mitochondria where the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain extract the remaining energy stored in the chemical bonds. Anaerobic respiration stops at glycolysis and fermentation, leaving most of the energy still locked in the ethanol molecule. The electron transport chain alone accounts for about 34 of the 36-38 ATP molecules produced.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because the difference is not about enzyme speed but about the completeness of glucose breakdown. Option C is wrong because both types start with one glucose molecule; the difference is in how completely it is broken down.

      "explanation_correct": "Light is the primary trigger for stomatal opening. During the day, light stimulates photosynthesis in the guard cells (which contain chloroplasts), increasing the sugar concentration within them. Additionally, light activates proton pumps that drive potassium ion (K+) uptake into the guard cells. The increased solute concentration lowers the water potential inside the guard cells, causing water to enter by osmosis. The guard cells become turgid and their differential wall thickness causes them to bow outward, opening the stomatal pore. At night, without light, this process reverses and stomata close.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because temperature alone is not the primary trigger; stomata respond mainly to light. Option C is wrong because wind does not physically push stomata open; stomatal movement is driven by turgor changes in guard cells. Option D is incorrect because plants actually produce less CO2 during the day (the net exchange favours O2 release due to photosynthesis), and high CO2 actually triggers stomatal closure, not opening."
