    "text": "The human digestive system breaks down food into nutrients that can be absorbed by the body. The alimentary canal is a continuous tube from mouth to anus, including the buccal cavity (teeth, tongue, salivary glands), pharynx, esophagus, stomach, small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, ileum), large intestine, and rectum. Digestion involves mechanical breakdown (chewing, peristalsis) and chemical breakdown by enzymes. Salivary amylase (ptyalin) acts on starch in the mouth. In the stomach, pepsin digests proteins in an acidic environment. The small intestine receives bile from the liver (emulsifies fats) and pancreatic juice (contains trypsin, lipase, amylase). Intestinal juice completes digestion. Villi in the small intestine absorb nutrients into blood and lymph.",
    "rules": [
      "Digestion begins in the mouth with mechanical and chemical breakdown",
      "Salivary amylase (ptyalin) converts starch to maltose",
      "Peristalsis moves food through the alimentary canal",
      "Stomach secretes HCl (kills bacteria, provides acidic pH) and pepsin (digests proteins)",
      "Bile from liver emulsifies fats but contains no enzymes",
      "Pancreatic juice contains trypsin (proteins), lipase (fats), and amylase (starch)",
      "Villi and microvilli in small intestine increase surface area for absorption",
      "Glucose and amino acids are absorbed into blood capillaries",
      "Fatty acids and glycerol are absorbed into lacteals (lymph vessels)",
      "Large intestine absorbs water and some vitamins; stores feces"

      "explanation_incorrect": "The digestion of starch actually starts in the mouth, not the stomach. When you chew food, the salivary glands release an enzyme called ptyalin or amylase that begins to break down the starch in the food. The food then moves to the stomach, where the digestion of starch does not continue. Instead, the stomach produces an acidic environment and digestive enzymes that work on proteins, not starch."

      "explanation_correct": "Ghee is a fat, and fat digestion begins in the duodenum (first part of the small intestine). Here, bile from the liver emulsifies the fat globules into smaller droplets, increasing the surface area. Then pancreatic lipase acts on these emulsified fat droplets and breaks them down into fatty acids and glycerol. Bile itself contains no enzymes but is essential for making fats accessible to lipase. This is the correct sequence for fat digestion in the human body.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Pepsin in the stomach digests proteins, not fats. Salivary amylase in the mouth acts on starch, not fats. The large intestine does not digest fats; its role is water absorption and storage of faeces. Fat digestion specifically requires bile for emulsification and lipase for chemical breakdown, both of which act in the duodenum of the small intestine."

      "explanation_correct": "Meera's grandfather has difficulty digesting oily food because his dysfunctional liver is not producing sufficient bile. Bile is essential for emulsifying fats into smaller droplets in the duodenum, which increases the surface area for lipase to act upon. Without adequate bile, large fat globules remain intact and lipase cannot efficiently break them down, leading to poor fat digestion. The yellowish skin is due to buildup of bilirubin (a bile pigment) that the liver cannot process properly.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The liver does not produce pepsin (that is produced by the stomach), does not produce lipase (that is produced by the pancreas), and does not produce HCl (that is secreted by the gastric glands in the stomach). The liver's key role in digestion is the production of bile, which emulsifies fats. Without functional bile production, fats cannot be properly emulsified and therefore cannot be efficiently digested by lipase."

Many students mistakenly believe bile is an enzyme or contains enzymes because it plays such an important role in fat digestion. In reality, bile only emulsifies fats (breaks large fat globules into smaller droplets) to increase surface area for lipase action. It contains bile salts, bile pigments (bilirubin), cholesterol, and water, but no enzymes.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Saliva contains the enzyme salivary amylase (ptyalin) that digests starch. Gastric juice contains the enzyme pepsin (and rennin in infants) that digests proteins. Pancreatic juice contains multiple enzymes: trypsin, lipase, and amylase. All three of these secretions contain enzymes.

While glucose, amino acids, and water-soluble vitamins are all absorbed directly into the blood capillaries of the villi, fatty acids and glycerol take a different route. They are absorbed into the lacteals (central lymph vessels) within each villus and travel through the lymphatic system before eventually entering the bloodstream. This is a common misconception among students who assume all nutrients follow the same absorption pathway.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Glucose and amino acids are both absorbed into blood capillaries in the villi, which is the typical pathway most students learn. Water-soluble vitamins are also absorbed into blood capillaries. The exception is fatty acids and glycerol, which follow a unique absorption route through the lacteals (lymph vessels) rather than directly into blood capillaries. This is because reconstituted fats are too large to pass through the walls of blood capillaries."

Some students confuse it with accessory organs because it receives secretions from the liver (bile) and pancreas (pancreatic juice), but it is not an accessory organ. It is actually part of the main digestive tract through which food physically passes. The liver, pancreas, and gallbladder are true accessory organs because food does not pass through them.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The liver, pancreas, and gallbladder are all accessory digestive organs. They contribute secretions to aid digestion but food does not pass through them. The liver produces bile, the gallbladder stores bile, and the pancreas produces pancreatic juice. The duodenum, on the other hand, is part of the alimentary canal itself. It is the section of the small intestine where bile and pancreatic juice are received, and food physically travels through it during digestion."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Salivary amylase (ptyalin) requires a neutral to slightly alkaline pH (around 6.8-7.0) to function effectively. When the food bolus enters the stomach, it encounters the highly acidic environment (pH approximately 2) created by HCl secreted by the gastric glands. This extreme change in pH denatures the salivary amylase, altering its three-dimensional protein structure and rendering it inactive. This is why starch digestion that began in the mouth is temporarily halted in the stomach.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Physical churning does not destroy enzyme molecules; denaturation is a chemical process. Pepsin digests dietary proteins, not salivary amylase specifically, and certainly does not convert it into maltose. The stomach does not absorb enzymes into the blood. The real reason is that enzymes are highly sensitive to pH, and the acidic stomach environment denatures salivary amylase, stopping its action on starch."

      ],
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "Villi are essential for efficient absorption because they dramatically increase the surface area of the inner lining of the small intestine. Each villus is a finger-like projection that is richly supplied with blood capillaries (to absorb glucose and amino acids) and a central lacteal (to absorb fatty acids and glycerol). The increased surface area ensures that the maximum amount of digested nutrients can be absorbed in the minimum time as food passes through. Without villi, the flat intestinal surface would be insufficient for the body's nutritional needs.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Villi do not secrete digestive enzymes; enzymes are present in intestinal juice produced by intestinal glands. Villi do not produce bile; bile is produced by the liver. Villi are not responsible for peristalsis; peristalsis is caused by the contraction of smooth muscles in the intestinal wall. The primary reason villi are essential is their role in increasing surface area and providing blood capillaries and lacteals for efficient nutrient transport."

      ],
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Bile emulsification is necessary because fats are insoluble in water and tend to form large globules in the aqueous environment of the small intestine. Lipase, being a water-soluble enzyme, can only act on the surface of these fat globules. When bile breaks large fat globules into many tiny droplets (emulsification), the total surface area exposed to lipase increases enormously. This allows lipase to act on a much larger area simultaneously, greatly increasing the rate of fat digestion. Without emulsification, fat digestion would be extremely slow and incomplete.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Bile salts are not co-enzymes for lipase; they are emulsifying agents. Bile does not chemically convert fats into fatty acids; that is the job of lipase. Lipase is not inactive in the presence of large globules; it simply has very little surface area to work on. The correct reason is that emulsification increases the surface area available for lipase action, making fat digestion faster and more efficient."
