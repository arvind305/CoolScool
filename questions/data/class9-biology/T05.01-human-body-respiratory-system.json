  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "The respiratory system enables gas exchange between the body and the environment. Air enters through nostrils, passes through the nasal cavity (filtered, warmed, moistened), pharynx, larynx (voice box), trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles, finally reaching the alveoli in the lungs. Alveoli are thin-walled air sacs surrounded by capillaries where gas exchange occurs by diffusion. Breathing involves inspiration (diaphragm contracts and flattens, ribs move up and out) and expiration (diaphragm relaxes, ribs move down and in). Oxygen binds to hemoglobin forming oxyhemoglobin for transport. Cellular respiration in mitochondria produces ATP from glucose. Common respiratory disorders include asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema.",
    "rules": [
      "Air is filtered, warmed, and moistened in the nasal cavity",
      "The larynx contains vocal cords for voice production",
      "Trachea has C-shaped cartilage rings to keep it open",
      "Alveoli are adapted for gas exchange: thin walls, large surface area, moist, rich blood supply",
      "During inspiration, diaphragm contracts and flattens, ribs move up and out",
      "During expiration, diaphragm relaxes, ribs move down and in",
      "Oxygen diffuses from alveoli to blood; CO2 diffuses from blood to alveoli",
      "Oxygen is transported bound to hemoglobin as oxyhemoglobin",
      "CO2 is transported mainly as bicarbonate ions in plasma",

Option C, trachea, is incorrect because the trachea is part of the respiratory system, not the entry point for air.

Gas exchange in the lungs occurs by the process of diffusion, where oxygen and carbon dioxide move across the thin walls of the alveoli and the surrounding blood capillaries. This happens due to the difference in concentration of these gases between the air in the alveoli and the blood.",

Active transport is a process where substances move against their concentration gradient, which is not how gas exchange occurs in the lungs. Osmosis is the movement of water across a semi-permeable membrane, which is also not the mechanism for gas exchange. Filtration is the process of removing larger particles from a solution, which is not how oxygen and carbon dioxide move in the respiratory system."

      "explanation_incorrect": "It is a common misconception that both the right and left lungs have the same number of lobes. However, the right lung is divided into three lobes (upper, middle, and lower), while the left lung is divided into two lobes (upper and lower). This difference in lobe count is due to the placement of the heart, which takes up more space on the left side of the chest."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement is false because gas exchange occurs in the alveoli, not the bronchi. The alveoli are small air sacs in the lungs where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged between the air and the blood. The bronchi are the larger airways that bring air into and out of the lungs, but they are not involved in the gas exchange process."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be that the pleural membrane does not produce a fluid to reduce friction during breathing.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct order from largest to smallest diameter is: Trachea, Bronchi, Bronchioles, Terminal bronchioles. This is because the trachea is the main air passage that leads air into the lungs, and it needs to be wider to allow for a greater volume of air flow. The bronchi are the next largest as they branch off from the trachea, followed by the bronchioles which are smaller, and finally the terminal bronchioles which are the narrowest air passages in the lungs."

Coughing is a protective reflex action that creates a strong burst of air to expel foreign particles from the airway and prevent them from reaching the lungs.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because food inhaled through the mouth enters the trachea, not the nasal cavity. Option C is incorrect because a food particle of noticeable size would be stopped in the trachea or upper airways, not reach the tiny alveoli. Option D is incorrect because if the food went into the oesophagus, it would be in the digestive system, not causing airway obstruction and coughing."

During quiet expiration, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles simply relax, and the natural elastic recoil of the lungs and chest wall pushes air out. Active muscular effort is only needed during forced expiration (such as during heavy exercise or blowing). This is a common misconception among students who assume both inspiration and expiration always require active muscle contraction.",

Gas exchange in the alveoli occurs by passive diffusion along the concentration gradient, not by active transport. The thin walls of alveoli (one cell thick) are actually an essential adaptation that minimises the diffusion distance. Students sometimes confuse the active breathing mechanism (muscle contraction) with gas exchange at the alveolar level, which is entirely passive.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Options A, B, and D are all genuine adaptations of alveoli for efficient gas exchange.

Oxygen absorption occurs only in the alveoli of the lungs, where the thin walls and rich blood supply allow gas exchange by diffusion. Students sometimes mistakenly think gas exchange can happen anywhere along the respiratory tract, but it specifically occurs at the alveoli.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Options A, B, and D are all genuine functions of the nasal cavity.

These cristae greatly increase the surface area available for the enzymes and carrier molecules of the electron transport chain, allowing efficient production of ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. The cytoplasm lacks this specialised membrane system.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because the cytoplasm does contain enzymes (glycolysis occurs there). Option C is incorrect because the cytoplasm pH is suitable for many reactions, including glycolysis. Option D is incorrect because glucose is present in the cytoplasm where glycolysis breaks it down.

Since gas exchange occurs by diffusion, a shorter diffusion distance means gases can cross more rapidly, making the exchange more efficient. This is a critical structural adaptation of the alveoli for their function in respiration.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because wall thickness does not affect air storage capacity; it is the volume of the alveolus that matters. Option C is incorrect because while thin walls do contribute to lighter lungs, this is not the primary reason for the adaptation.

The open part of the C faces the oesophagus, allowing it to expand into this space when a bolus of food passes through. If the rings were complete circles, the oesophagus would not be able to expand properly during swallowing, making it difficult for food to pass down.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because the C-shape is not primarily for weight reduction. Option C is incorrect because gas exchange does not occur in the trachea; it occurs in the alveoli. Option D is incorrect because air does not escape from the sides of the trachea; the C-shaped rings still keep the airway open.
