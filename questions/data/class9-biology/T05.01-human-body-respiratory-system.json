    "text": "The respiratory system enables gas exchange between the body and the environment. Air enters through nostrils, passes through the nasal cavity (filtered, warmed, moistened), pharynx, larynx (voice box), trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles, finally reaching the alveoli in the lungs. Alveoli are thin-walled air sacs surrounded by capillaries where gas exchange occurs by diffusion. Breathing involves inspiration (diaphragm contracts and flattens, ribs move up and out) and expiration (diaphragm relaxes, ribs move down and in). Oxygen binds to hemoglobin forming oxyhemoglobin for transport. Cellular respiration in mitochondria produces ATP from glucose. Common respiratory disorders include asthma, bronchitis, and emphysema.",
    "rules": [
      "Air is filtered, warmed, and moistened in the nasal cavity",
      "The larynx contains vocal cords for voice production",
      "Trachea has C-shaped cartilage rings to keep it open",
      "Alveoli are adapted for gas exchange: thin walls, large surface area, moist, rich blood supply",
      "During inspiration, diaphragm contracts and flattens, ribs move up and out",
      "During expiration, diaphragm relaxes, ribs move down and in",
      "Oxygen diffuses from alveoli to blood; CO2 diffuses from blood to alveoli",
      "Oxygen is transported bound to hemoglobin as oxyhemoglobin",
      "CO2 is transported mainly as bicarbonate ions in plasma",

This movement of oxygen from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration is called diffusion.",

This is because the alveolar air has a higher concentration of oxygen compared to the blood, which has a lower concentration of oxygen. The oxygen then gets picked up by the hemoglobin in the red blood cells and transported to the tissues."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement is false because gas exchange occurs in the alveoli, not the bronchi. The alveoli are small air sacs in the lungs where oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged between the air and the blood. The bronchi are the larger airways that bring air into and out of the lungs, but they are not involved in the gas exchange process."
