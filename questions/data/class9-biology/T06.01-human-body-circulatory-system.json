    "text": "The circulatory system transports blood, nutrients, gases, and waste products throughout the body. Blood consists of plasma (55%) and cellular components (45%): red blood cells (carry oxygen), white blood cells (immunity), and platelets (clotting). The heart is a four-chambered muscular organ with two atria and two ventricles, separated by valves. The cardiac cycle involves systole (contraction) and diastole (relaxation). Blood flows through arteries (from heart), capillaries (exchange), and veins (to heart). Pulmonary circulation carries blood between heart and lungs; systemic circulation carries blood between heart and body. Blood clotting involves platelets, prothrombin, thrombin, and fibrin. Blood groups (ABO and Rh) determine transfusion compatibility.",
    "rules": [
      "Blood consists of plasma, RBCs, WBCs, and platelets",
      "RBCs carry oxygen bound to hemoglobin; have no nucleus; live about 120 days",
      "WBCs are part of the immune system; types include neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes",
      "Platelets are cell fragments involved in blood clotting",
      "Heart has four chambers: two atria (receive blood) and two ventricles (pump blood)",

These are the cellular components of blood, and they make up around 45% of the total blood volume. The majority of blood (around 55%) is the liquid plasma, which is mostly water with various dissolved substances."

Red blood cells, also called erythrocytes, make up about 45% of the blood volume and are responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body. In contrast, white blood cells, or leukocytes, make up a much smaller percentage of the blood volume.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The misconception is that white blood cells are more numerous than red blood cells. However, this is not the case. Red blood cells are the most abundant type of blood cells, making up about 45% of the blood volume, while white blood cells only make up a small fraction of the blood. The main role of white blood cells is to defend the body against infections, while red blood cells are responsible for carrying oxygen to the body's tissues."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Some people may think that heart valves don't control the flow of blood, but this is not correct. Heart valves are essential for ensuring blood flows in the right direction through the heart. They open to allow blood to flow forward, and close to prevent it from flowing backwards. This one-way flow is crucial for the efficient functioning of the circulatory system."
