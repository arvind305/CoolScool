    "text": "The circulatory system transports blood, nutrients, gases, and waste products throughout the body. Blood consists of plasma (55%) and cellular components (45%): red blood cells (carry oxygen), white blood cells (immunity), and platelets (clotting). The heart is a four-chambered muscular organ with two atria and two ventricles, separated by valves. The cardiac cycle involves systole (contraction) and diastole (relaxation). Blood flows through arteries (from heart), capillaries (exchange), and veins (to heart). Pulmonary circulation carries blood between heart and lungs; systemic circulation carries blood between heart and body. Blood clotting involves platelets, prothrombin, thrombin, and fibrin. Blood groups (ABO and Rh) determine transfusion compatibility.",
    "rules": [
      "Blood consists of plasma, RBCs, WBCs, and platelets",
      "RBCs carry oxygen bound to hemoglobin; have no nucleus; live about 120 days",
      "WBCs are part of the immune system; types include neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes",
      "Platelets are cell fragments involved in blood clotting",
      "Heart has four chambers: two atria (receive blood) and two ventricles (pump blood)",
      "Tricuspid valve is between right atrium and ventricle; bicuspid between left atrium and ventricle",
      "SA node is the pacemaker that initiates heartbeat",
      "Arteries carry blood away from heart; veins carry blood to heart",
      "Pulmonary artery carries deoxygenated blood; pulmonary vein carries oxygenated blood",

These are the cellular components of blood, and they make up around 45% of the total blood volume. The majority of blood (around 55%) is the liquid plasma, which is mostly water with various dissolved substances."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Red blood cells are more numerous than white blood cells in the blood. Red blood cells, also called erythrocytes, make up about 45% of the blood volume and are responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body. In contrast, white blood cells, or leukocytes, make up a much smaller percentage of the blood volume.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The misconception is that white blood cells are more numerous than red blood cells. However, this is not the case. Red blood cells are the most abundant type of blood cells, making up about 45% of the blood volume, while white blood cells only make up a small fraction of the blood. The main role of white blood cells is to defend the body against infections, while red blood cells are responsible for carrying oxygen to the body's tissues."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Some people may think that heart valves don't control the flow of blood, but this is not correct. Heart valves are essential for ensuring blood flows in the right direction through the heart. They open to allow blood to flow forward, and close to prevent it from flowing backwards.

This is because arteries carry blood at high pressure pumped directly from the heart, so they need strong, elastic walls to withstand and maintain that pressure. Veins carry blood at much lower pressure and rely on valves and skeletal muscle contractions to push blood back to the heart.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Arteries do not have thinner walls than veins, nor are their walls identical. The key structural difference is that arteries have much thicker, more muscular and elastic walls to handle the high-pressure blood flow from the heart.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The left ventricle does not have thinner walls, and the two ventricles are not identical.

It generates electrical impulses that initiate each heartbeat. When the SA node fails, the heart may beat irregularly or too slowly, and an artificial pacemaker is implanted to take over the function of generating regular electrical signals.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The AV node, Bundle of His, and Purkinje fibres are all part of the heart's conduction system, but they relay the electrical signal rather than initiate it. The SA node is specifically called the 'pacemaker' because it is the origin point of the electrical impulse that triggers the heartbeat. An artificial pacemaker replaces the function of the SA node."

Blood group O red blood cells have no A or B antigens on their surface, so the recipient's anti-B antibodies (present in blood group A plasma) will not attack the donated cells. This is why blood group O is called the universal donor. The other combinations would cause agglutination due to antigen-antibody incompatibility.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Donating A to B or B to A would cause agglutination because the recipient's antibodies would attack the donor's antigens. Donating AB to O would also cause agglutination because O blood has both anti-A and anti-B antibodies, which would attack both A and B antigens on the AB donor cells.

This is a much longer pathway than pulmonary circulation, requiring significantly higher pressure and therefore thicker muscular walls.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The left ventricle does not receive blood at high pressure from the lungs — the left atrium does, and at relatively low pressure. Deoxygenated blood is not heavier than oxygenated blood. The SA node is in the right atrium, and the atria contract before the ventricles. The correct reason is the need to generate high pressure for systemic circulation throughout the entire body."

Without valves, blood in veins — especially in the limbs — would flow backwards due to gravity. Arteries do not need valves because the high pressure from the heart's contraction maintains a continuous forward flow of blood.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "It is not the type of blood (oxygenated vs deoxygenated) that determines the need for valves — the pulmonary vein carries oxygenated blood but is still a vein. Veins are not necessarily larger than arteries; some arteries are very large (like the aorta). Arteries are not too rigid for valves. The correct reason is the low pressure in veins making them vulnerable to backflow, which valves prevent."

When blood passes through capillaries, some plasma leaks out as tissue fluid. The lymphatic system collects this excess tissue fluid, filters it through lymph nodes, and returns it to the bloodstream via the subclavian veins, completing the fluid circulation loop.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Lymph is not identical to blood plasma — it lacks red blood cells, platelets, and most large proteins. Lymph does not carry red blood cells; it primarily contains white blood cells (especially lymphocytes). Lymph is not directly pumped by the heart — it moves through lymphatic vessels via skeletal muscle contractions and breathing movements.
