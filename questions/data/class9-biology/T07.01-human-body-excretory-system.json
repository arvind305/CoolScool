    "text": "The excretory system removes metabolic waste products from the body to maintain homeostasis. The kidneys are the main excretory organs, filtering blood and producing urine. Each kidney contains about one million nephrons, the functional units. The nephron consists of the glomerulus (a tuft of capillaries in Bowman's capsule), proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule, and collecting duct. Urine formation involves ultrafiltration (in glomerulus), selective reabsorption (in tubules), and tubular secretion. Urine is stored in the urinary bladder and expelled through the urethra. Kidney disorders include kidney stones and kidney failure, which may require dialysis.",

Excretion involves removing waste products from the body to maintain its internal balance, while egestion is the elimination of undigested food from the digestive system. The excretory system, including the kidneys, filters blood and produces urine, which is then stored in the bladder and expelled from the body. Egestion, on the other hand, occurs at the end of the digestive process."
