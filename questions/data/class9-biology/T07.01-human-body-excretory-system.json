    "text": "The excretory system removes metabolic waste products from the body to maintain homeostasis. The kidneys are the main excretory organs, filtering blood and producing urine. Each kidney contains about one million nephrons, the functional units. The nephron consists of the glomerulus (a tuft of capillaries in Bowman's capsule), proximal convoluted tubule, loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule, and collecting duct. Urine formation involves ultrafiltration (in glomerulus), selective reabsorption (in tubules), and tubular secretion. Urine is stored in the urinary bladder and expelled through the urethra. Kidney disorders include kidney stones and kidney failure, which may require dialysis.",

      "explanation_correct": "Excretion and egestion are not the same process. Excretion is the removal of metabolic waste products from the body, like urea and carbon dioxide, to maintain homeostasis. Egestion is the process of eliminating undigested food materials from the digestive system.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Excretion and egestion are different processes. Excretion involves removing waste products from the body to maintain its internal balance, while egestion is the elimination of undigested food from the digestive system. The excretory system, including the kidneys, filters blood and produces urine, which is then stored in the bladder and expelled from the body. Egestion, on the other hand, occurs at the end of the digestive process."

This condition is called proteinuria (for proteins) or haematuria (for blood cells).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Options A and D are incorrect because urea, salts, potassium ions, and hydrogen ions are normally found in urine and their presence would not be unusual. Option B is incorrect because water is always in urine, and glucose, while filtered, is normally reabsorbed -- its presence would indicate diabetes, not glomerular damage. Only proteins and blood cells, which are normally too large to be filtered, would appear due to damaged glomerular walls."

      "explanation_correct": "When Meera drinks a large volume of water, her blood becomes diluted and its osmotic concentration decreases. The hypothalamus detects this change and signals the pituitary gland to release less ADH (antidiuretic hormone). With less ADH acting on the collecting ducts, less water is reabsorbed back into the blood. This results in a large volume of dilute, almost colourless urine being produced.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is the opposite of what happens -- increased ADH would produce concentrated urine, not dilute urine. Option C is wrong because insulin affects blood sugar, not urine volume or colour. Option D is incorrect because adrenaline is related to the fight-or-flight response, not routine water balance. The correct explanation involves decreased ADH when the body has excess water."

This is true excretion because the waste is a by-product of metabolism. The other options involve substances that were never part of metabolism: undigested cellulose was never absorbed into cells (egestion), vomited food never completed digestion, and mucus traps foreign particles rather than being a metabolic waste product.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Many students confuse excretion with any removal of substances from the body. Undigested cellulose (A) is removed by egestion, not excretion, because it was never absorbed into body cells. Vomited food (C) is expelled material from the stomach, not a product of metabolism. Mucus (D) is a protective secretion, not a metabolic waste. Only CO2, produced as a by-product of cellular respiration, qualifies as an excretory product."

However, it is NOT normally found in the final urine because the proximal convoluted tubule completely reabsorbs all filtered glucose back into the blood through active transport. This is a common point of confusion -- students often assume that if something is filtered, it must end up in urine. Urea, sodium chloride, and water are all partially reabsorbed but still remain in the final urine.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Urea (A), sodium chloride (B), and water (D) are all present in both the glomerular filtrate and the final urine. While some amount of each is reabsorbed, significant quantities remain in the urine.

The ureter, renal pelvis, and urinary bladder are all parts of the urinary system but are NOT components of the nephron. The nephron specifically consists of the Bowman's capsule, glomerulus, PCT, Loop of Henle, DCT, and collecting duct.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The ureter (A) is a tube carrying urine from the kidney to the bladder -- it is part of the urinary system, not the nephron.

The prefix 'ultra' indicates that the filtration is extremely fine -- small molecules like water, glucose, urea, and salts pass through the capillary walls and basement membrane, while large molecules like proteins and blood cells are retained. This pressure-driven molecular-level filtration is what distinguishes it from simple filtration.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because ultrafiltration is a physical, pressure-driven process, not a chemical one involving enzymes. Option C describes selective reabsorption, not ultrafiltration -- ultrafiltration is actually non-selective and filters all small molecules regardless of their usefulness. Option D is incorrect because ultrafiltration filters many substances (water, glucose, amino acids, urea, salts), not just urea."

      "explanation_correct": "Although ammonia is the first nitrogenous waste produced during deamination of amino acids, it is extremely toxic to cells even in small concentrations. It cannot be allowed to accumulate or travel long distances in the blood. Therefore, the liver rapidly converts ammonia into urea through the ornithine cycle (urea cycle). Urea is much less toxic, highly soluble in water, and can be safely transported in the blood to the kidneys for excretion. This is why urea, not ammonia, is classified as the main nitrogenous waste excreted by humans.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because ammonia is indeed produced in the human body during protein metabolism. Option C is incorrect because ammonia is not excreted by the lungs -- the lungs excrete carbon dioxide. Option D is wrong because urea is produced in the liver, not in muscles, and the key reason is toxicity, not quantity. The correct reason is that ammonia's high toxicity necessitates its conversion to the safer urea for transport and excretion."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "The proximal convoluted tubule is coiled (convoluted) to maximise the surface area within the limited space of the kidney cortex. A greater surface area means more epithelial cells are available for the active transport of glucose, amino acids, vitamins, and ions back into the blood. The cells lining the PCT also have microvilli (brush border) to further increase the absorptive surface. This design ensures that nearly all useful substances filtered during ultrafiltration are efficiently reabsorbed.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because ultrafiltration occurs in the glomerulus, not in the PCT, and the PCT does not generate pressure. Option C is incorrect because backflow is prevented by the one-directional flow of filtrate, not by the shape of the tubule. Option D is wrong because urine concentration primarily occurs in the Loop of Henle and collecting duct, not in the PCT. The coiling specifically serves to increase surface area for reabsorption."
