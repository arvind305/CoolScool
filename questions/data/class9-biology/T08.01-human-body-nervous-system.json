    "text": "The nervous system controls and coordinates body activities through electrical impulses. It consists of the central nervous system (CNS: brain and spinal cord) and peripheral nervous system (PNS: nerves). Neurons are the functional units, consisting of cell body, dendrites (receive impulses), and axon (transmit impulses). The brain has three main parts: cerebrum (thinking, memory, voluntary actions), cerebellum (balance, coordination), and medulla oblongata (involuntary functions like breathing, heartbeat). The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and controls reflex actions. Reflex arc components include receptor, sensory neuron, relay neuron, motor neuron, and effector. Sense organs (eye, ear) provide sensory input.",

      "correct_answer": true,
      "explanation_correct": "The myelin sheath acts as an insulator around the axon of a neuron, which helps to speed up the transmission of nerve impulses. This is because the myelin sheath allows the electrical signals to 'jump' from one gap (node of Ranvier) to the next, increasing the speed of transmission.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Some students may think that the myelin sheath slows down nerve impulse transmission, but this is not correct. The myelin sheath actually helps to speed up the transmission of nerve impulses by insulating the axon and allowing the electrical signals to 'jump' from one gap to the next, a process called saltatory conduction. This makes the transmission of signals much faster compared to neurons without a myelin sheath."

The key features in the scenario are: (1) the neuron is located entirely within the spinal cord (part of the CNS), (2) it has short projections, and (3) it connects two other neurons. Relay neurons are found within the CNS and act as connectors between sensory neurons and motor neurons in the reflex arc. They are typically short with branching processes on both sides.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because sensory neurons have long dendrites extending from receptors to the CNS and are not located entirely within the spinal cord. Option B is wrong because motor neurons have long axons extending from the CNS to effectors. Option D is wrong because receptor cells are found in sense organs, not within the spinal cord."

Since the patient can think clearly (cerebrum is intact), move voluntarily (cerebrum intact), and maintain balance (cerebellum intact), but cannot breathe on his own and has an irregular heartbeat, the medulla oblongata must be affected. The medulla oblongata controls involuntary vital functions such as breathing, heartbeat, and blood pressure. Damage to this region is extremely dangerous and often requires life support like a ventilator.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because the patient can still think and move voluntarily, meaning the cerebrum is functioning. Option B is wrong because the patient can maintain balance, indicating the cerebellum is intact. Option D is wrong because meninges are protective membranes, not a functional part of the brain that controls breathing or heartbeat."

A common misconception among students is that any quick action is a reflex. However, reflex actions must be automatic, involuntary, and not require conscious brain involvement.

Students often confuse axon and synapse functions because both are involved in impulse transmission. However, the synapse specifically ensures that impulses travel in only one direction — from presynaptic to postsynaptic neuron — through the release of neurotransmitters from vesicles in the axon terminal. The other options (conducting impulses, myelin insulation, carrying impulses away from the cell body) are all functions of the axon.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Options A, C, and D are all functions of the axon: it conducts electrical impulses along its length (A), is insulated by myelin sheath for saltatory conduction (C), and carries impulses away from the cell body towards the axon terminal (D).

This is a common source of confusion because students sometimes think all brain functions involve conscious control via the cerebrum. However, blood pressure regulation is an involuntary function that happens continuously without any conscious effort, which is characteristic of medulla oblongata control. Solving maths problems (thinking), recalling names (memory), and deciding to raise a hand (voluntary action) are all cerebrum functions.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Options A, B, and D are all cerebrum functions. Solving a mathematics problem requires reasoning and thinking (cerebrum). Recalling a friend's name uses memory centres in the cerebrum. Deciding to raise your hand is a voluntary action controlled by the motor areas of the cerebrum.

If the impulse had to travel all the way to the brain for processing and then back to the effector, it would take significantly longer. In situations involving danger — such as touching a hot surface or stepping on a sharp object — even a fraction of a second delay could result in serious injury. The reflex arc through the spinal cord ensures an almost instantaneous protective response.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because the brain is actually larger and has far more neurons than the spinal cord. Option C is wrong because the brain can and does process sensory information — the person eventually feels pain after the reflex has already occurred. Option D is wrong because the spinal cord does not contain thinking centres; it simply provides a rapid relay pathway for reflexes."

This insulation prevents the nerve impulse from leaking out and forces it to 'jump' from one Node of Ranvier (gap in the myelin) to the next, a process called saltatory conduction. This jumping mechanism makes impulse transmission significantly faster compared to unmyelinated neurons. In conditions where the myelin sheath is damaged (such as multiple sclerosis), nerve impulse transmission slows down dramatically, leading to impaired movement and sensation.",

      "explanation_correct": "In myopia, the eyeball is too long or the lens is too curved, causing light from distant objects to converge and form an image in front of the retina rather than on it. A concave (diverging) lens is used because it slightly spreads out (diverges) the incoming light rays before they enter the eye. This divergence effectively moves the focal point backward so that it falls exactly on the retina, producing a clear image. A convex lens would converge the light rays even further, making the problem worse by moving the focal point even more in front of the retina.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because the concave lens does not magnify the image; it diverges light to correct the focal point. Option C describes the function of a convex lens (converging), not a concave lens.
