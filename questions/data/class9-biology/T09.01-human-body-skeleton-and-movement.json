    "text": "The skeletal system provides support, protection, movement, mineral storage, and blood cell production. The human skeleton has 206 bones divided into axial skeleton (skull, vertebral column, rib cage - 80 bones) and appendicular skeleton (limbs and girdles - 126 bones). Bones are classified as long, short, flat, and irregular. Bone cells include osteocytes (mature), osteoblasts (bone-forming), and osteoclasts (bone-resorbing). Joints are classified as fibrous (immovable), cartilaginous (slightly movable), and synovial (freely movable). Synovial joints include ball and socket, hinge, pivot, and gliding. Muscles work in antagonistic pairs; skeletal muscles are striated and voluntary, smooth muscles are unstriated and involuntary, and cardiac muscles are striated but involuntary.",

      "explanation_correct": "The order from shortest to longest bone types is: Short bones (carpals), Flat bones (skull), Long bones (femur). Short bones like the carpals in the wrists are the smallest, flat bones like the skull are longer, and long bones like the femur in the thigh are the longest.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Long bones (femur), Short bones (carpals), Flat bones (skull). This is incorrect because long bones like the femur are the longest, short bones like the carpals are shorter, and flat bones like the skull are the shortest of the three bone types."
