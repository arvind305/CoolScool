    "text": "The skeletal system provides support, protection, movement, mineral storage, and blood cell production. The human skeleton has 206 bones divided into axial skeleton (skull, vertebral column, rib cage - 80 bones) and appendicular skeleton (limbs and girdles - 126 bones). Bones are classified as long, short, flat, and irregular. Bone cells include osteocytes (mature), osteoblasts (bone-forming), and osteoclasts (bone-resorbing). Joints are classified as fibrous (immovable), cartilaginous (slightly movable), and synovial (freely movable). Synovial joints include ball and socket, hinge, pivot, and gliding. Muscles work in antagonistic pairs; skeletal muscles are striated and voluntary, smooth muscles are unstriated and involuntary, and cardiac muscles are striated but involuntary.",

      "explanation_correct": "The doctor was referring to osteoblasts, which are the bone-forming cells. When a fracture occurs, osteoblasts become highly active at the fracture site, depositing new bone matrix (made of collagen and minerals) to bridge the gap and repair the broken bone. Over time, this new bone tissue hardens and restores the structural integrity of the bone.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Osteoclasts break down bone — they would not deposit new bone to repair a fracture. Osteocytes are mature bone cells that maintain existing bone but do not actively form new bone tissue. Chondrocytes are cartilage cells, not bone cells. The cells responsible for depositing new bone tissue during fracture repair are osteoblasts."

It is found exclusively in the heart and contracts rhythmically on its own without conscious effort.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The biceps and thigh muscles are skeletal muscles that are striated AND voluntary — they do not break the expected pattern. Smooth muscle of the intestine is involuntary but unstriated — it also fits the simple rule.

      "explanation_correct": "The 11th and 12th pairs of ribs are called 'floating ribs' because while they are attached to the thoracic vertebrae at the back, they have no attachment to the sternum (directly or through cartilage) at the front. Their anterior ends remain free, giving them the appearance of 'floating'. This is in contrast to the true ribs (pairs 1-7) which attach directly to the sternum, and false ribs (pairs 8-10) which attach to the sternum indirectly through the cartilage of the 7th rib.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Floating ribs are not entirely unattached — they are firmly connected to the vertebrae at the back. They are made of bone, not cartilage (though like all ribs, they have a cartilaginous portion). The term 'floating' does not refer to their movement during breathing. The reason they are called floating ribs is specifically because they lack any anterior attachment to the sternum, leaving their front ends free."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Healthy bones require a balance between bone formation and bone resorption. Osteoclasts break down old, damaged, or excess bone tissue, while osteoblasts deposit fresh, new bone matrix in its place. This continuous cycle of removal and replacement is called bone remodelling. It allows bones to repair micro-damage, adapt to mechanical stress, and maintain proper mineral balance. Without osteoclasts, old bone would accumulate; without osteoblasts, removed bone would not be replaced.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Osteoblasts do not produce cartilage — they produce bone matrix. Both cell types are active throughout life, not restricted to children or adults only. Neither osteoblasts nor osteoclasts act on tendons or ligaments — they work exclusively on bone tissue. The correct reason is that bones undergo continuous remodelling: osteoclasts remove old bone and osteoblasts build new bone, and this balance is essential for maintaining bone health."

It also acts as a shock absorber, cushioning the bones and preventing damage from impacts and the stresses of daily movement. Without this cartilage, the rough bone surfaces would grind against each other, causing pain and damage.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Synovial fluid is produced by the synovial membrane lining the joint capsule, not by the cartilage. Muscles are attached to bones by tendons, not by cartilage at joint surfaces. The cartilage does not permanently connect the bones — that would make the joint immovable. The specific reason cartilage covers bone ends at joints is to reduce friction and absorb shock during movement."
