    "text": "Disease is a condition that impairs normal body functions. Pathogens (disease-causing organisms) include bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, and parasitic worms. Diseases are classified as infectious (communicable) and non-infectious (non-communicable). Transmission occurs through direct contact, air, water, food, and vectors. Immunity is the body's ability to resist disease. Innate immunity (present from birth) includes physical barriers (skin, mucus) and cellular defenses (WBCs, inflammation). Acquired immunity develops after exposure and involves antibodies produced by B-lymphocytes in response to antigens. Active immunity results from infection or vaccination; passive immunity involves receiving antibodies from another source. Vaccines contain weakened or killed pathogens that stimulate immune response without causing disease.",
