    "text": "Disease is a condition that impairs normal body functions. Pathogens (disease-causing organisms) include bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, and parasitic worms. Diseases are classified as infectious (communicable) and non-infectious (non-communicable). Transmission occurs through direct contact, air, water, food, and vectors. Immunity is the body's ability to resist disease. Innate immunity (present from birth) includes physical barriers (skin, mucus) and cellular defenses (WBCs, inflammation). Acquired immunity develops after exposure and involves antibodies produced by B-lymphocytes in response to antigens. Active immunity results from infection or vaccination; passive immunity involves receiving antibodies from another source. Vaccines contain weakened or killed pathogens that stimulate immune response without causing disease.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Some students may think mosquitoes are not involved in the transmission of diseases like malaria and dengue. However, mosquitoes play a crucial role as vectors for these illnesses. They pick up the disease-causing parasites or viruses when they bite an infected person, and then spread the pathogens to healthy individuals during their subsequent bites."

Innate immunity includes physical barriers like the skin and mucus, as well as cellular defenses like white blood cells, which can attack many different types of pathogens.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Innate immunity is a general, non-specific defense system that is present from birth. It does not target or respond to particular pathogens.

Acquired immunity is the immunity that develops after you've been exposed to a pathogen and your body has learned to recognize and fight it.

This provides immediate protection, but the antibodies gradually get used up or eliminated from the body over time. In contrast, active immunity develops after exposure to a pathogen or vaccine, and the body continues to produce antibodies, providing long-lasting protection.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "It is actually incorrect that passive immunity lasts longer than active immunity. Passive immunity provides short-term protection, as the antibodies received from an external source are eventually used up or eliminated from the body.

      "explanation_correct": "Passive immunity from antibody injection is the shortest lasting, as the injected antibodies are eventually broken down by the body. Passive immunity from mother's milk lasts longer, until the antibodies are no longer present in the milk. Active immunity from vaccination is the longest lasting, as it involves the body producing its own antibodies that can remain for years or even a lifetime.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct order from shortest to longest lasting immunity is: Passive immunity from antibody injection, Passive immunity from mother's milk, Active immunity from vaccination. Passive immunity involves receiving pre-made antibodies, either through injection or from a mother's milk, and these antibodies only last for a limited time. In contrast, active immunity from vaccination leads to the body producing its own antibodies that can provide long-term protection."
