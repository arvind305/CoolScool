    "text": "Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease. Personal hygiene includes practices like regular bathing, hand washing, oral care, and proper grooming. Community health involves sanitation, safe water supply, and waste management. A balanced diet provides carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, water, and fiber in proper proportions. Deficiency diseases result from lack of essential nutrients. Mental health is equally important, involving emotional and psychological well-being. Stress management through exercise, relaxation, and adequate sleep is essential. Substance abuse (tobacco, alcohol, drugs) has severe health consequences and should be avoided.",

This means that health involves your overall wellness, not just the lack of any illnesses or problems.",

Health also includes mental and social well-being, not just the absence of stress (option D). The WHO's definition of health is more comprehensive, involving complete physical, mental, and social well-being."

It needs to have the right amounts of carbohydrates, fats, minerals, and fiber as well, along with proteins and vitamins. A diet that lacks some of these essential nutrients would not be considered balanced.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "A balanced diet needs to have all the major food groups - carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and fiber. It's not just about proteins and vitamins. Carbohydrates provide energy, fats are important for growth and development, and minerals like calcium and iron are essential too.
