    "text": "Health is a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease. Personal hygiene includes practices like regular bathing, hand washing, oral care, and proper grooming. Community health involves sanitation, safe water supply, and waste management. A balanced diet provides carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, water, and fiber in proper proportions. Deficiency diseases result from lack of essential nutrients. Mental health is equally important, involving emotional and psychological well-being. Stress management through exercise, relaxation, and adequate sleep is essential. Substance abuse (tobacco, alcohol, drugs) has severe health consequences and should be avoided.",

This means that health involves your overall wellness, not just the lack of any illnesses or problems.",

Health also includes mental and social well-being, not just the absence of stress (option D). The WHO's definition of health is more comprehensive, involving complete physical, mental, and social well-being."

Eating with unclean hands can allow germs and bacteria to enter our body and make us sick.

      "explanation_correct": "Hand washing with soap is an effective way to prevent many diseases. Soap helps remove germs and bacteria from your hands, which can prevent the spread of illnesses like the common cold, flu, and even more serious diseases. Washing your hands regularly, especially before eating and after using the bathroom, is an important part of good personal hygiene.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "It is false to say that hand washing with soap cannot prevent many diseases. In fact, hand washing with soap is one of the most effective ways to stop the spread of germs and prevent illnesses. Soap helps break down the outer layer of many types of bacteria and viruses, killing them and removing them from your hands. Regular hand washing is an essential part of maintaining good health and hygiene."

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation_correct": "Boiling water kills most disease-causing organisms because the high temperature destroys the cells and structures of bacteria, viruses, and other microbes that can make you sick. This makes boiled water safe to drink and use for cooking.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Some people may think that boiling water does not kill disease-causing organisms, but this is not correct. The high temperature of boiling (100°C or 212°F) is hot enough to kill most germs and pathogens that can cause illnesses. Boiling water is an effective way to purify it and make it safe for drinking, cooking, and other uses."
