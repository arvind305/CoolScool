    "text": "Waste management involves the collection, transportation, processing, and disposal of waste materials. Waste is classified as biodegradable (can be decomposed by microorganisms, e.g., food waste, paper) and non-biodegradable (cannot be decomposed, e.g., plastics, glass, metals). Solid waste includes domestic, industrial, and agricultural waste. Disposal methods include landfilling, incineration, and composting. Sewage treatment involves primary (physical), secondary (biological), and tertiary (chemical) stages. The 3Rs - Reduce, Reuse, Recycle - are key strategies for waste minimization. Hazardous waste includes chemicals, batteries, and e-waste, requiring special handling. Biogas production from organic waste provides a renewable energy source.",

      "Biodegradable waste can be broken down by microorganisms (food, paper, leaves)",
      "Non-biodegradable waste persists in environment (plastics, glass, metals)",

      "explanation_incorrect": "Recycling is important, but reducing waste is even more effective. When we reduce the amount of waste we generate, we're saving resources and energy that would have been used to produce, transport, and process that waste.

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is: Organic waste placed in digester, Anaerobic bacteria decompose waste, Biogas collected and used as fuel, Slurry used as fertilizer. This is the logical sequence of steps in the biogas production process, where the organic waste is first placed in a digester, then broken down by anaerobic bacteria, and the resulting biogas is collected for use as fuel, while the leftover slurry is used as a nutrient-rich fertilizer.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Biogas collected and used as fuel, Organic waste placed in digester, Slurry used as fertilizer, Anaerobic bacteria decompose waste. This is not the correct sequence because the biogas cannot be collected before the organic waste is placed in the digester and broken down by the anaerobic bacteria. The slurry can only be used as fertilizer after the bacteria have decomposed the waste."
