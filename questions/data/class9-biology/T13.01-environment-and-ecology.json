    "text": "An ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with their physical environment. Components include biotic (producers, consumers, decomposers) and abiotic (temperature, light, water, soil) factors. Energy flows through food chains and food webs, with only about 10% transferred between trophic levels. Biogeochemical cycles (carbon, nitrogen, water, oxygen) recycle matter through ecosystems. Environmental pollution includes air, water, soil, and noise pollution. Biodiversity encompasses genetic, species, and ecosystem diversity. Conservation strategies include in-situ (national parks, sanctuaries) and ex-situ (zoos, botanical gardens) methods. Global issues include climate change, ozone depletion, and acid rain.",
    "rules": [
      "Ecosystem = biotic community + abiotic environment",
      "Producers are autotrophs that make their own food through photosynthesis",
      "Consumers are heterotrophs: primary (herbivores), secondary (carnivores), tertiary (top predators)",
      "Energy transfer follows the 10% rule between trophic levels",
      "Carbon cycle: photosynthesis fixes CO2; respiration and decomposition release it",
      "Nitrogen cycle involves fixation, nitrification, assimilation, and denitrification",
      "Air pollution: caused by vehicles and industries; effects include respiratory diseases",
      "Water pollution: caused by sewage and industrial waste; leads to eutrophication",
      "Biodiversity hotspots are areas with high species diversity but threatened habitats",

      "explanation_incorrect": "It is a common misconception that energy is recycled in an ecosystem like matter. However, this is not the case. Energy enters the ecosystem through producers (like plants) and flows through the food chain, but it is not recycled.

      "explanation_incorrect": "Eutrophication does not lead to oxygen increase in water. Instead, it causes a decrease in oxygen levels. This is because the excess growth of algae and plants uses up a lot of oxygen during the day for photosynthesis, and at night, the same algae and plants use up even more oxygen during respiration.

He tells Rohan that these crops improve soil fertility even without adding chemical fertilisers. Rohan learns in class that these plants have special bacteria in their roots. Why do pulse crops improve soil fertility?",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Pulse crops (legumes) like moong and chana have a symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria that live in their root nodules. These bacteria fix atmospheric nitrogen (N2) into ammonia (NH3), which is then converted into nitrates that plants can use. This process enriches the soil with nitrogen compounds, improving soil fertility naturally without the need for chemical fertilisers. This is why farmers often practise crop rotation with legumes.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because while roots do release CO2 through respiration, this does not enrich soil fertility. Option C is wrong because legumes do not specifically absorb pollutants. Option D is incorrect because roots primarily absorb water and minerals, they do not add significant oxygen to the soil. The nitrogen fixation by Rhizobium bacteria is the specific reason legumes improve soil fertility."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "The Taj Mahal and other marble monuments are being damaged by acid rain, which is a well-documented phenomenon sometimes called 'marble cancer'. Industries and vehicles emit SO2 and NOx, which react with water vapour in the atmosphere to form sulphuric acid and nitric acid. This acid rain reacts with the calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in marble, causing it to discolour, corrode, and become rough. This is a real environmental issue faced by monuments in Agra and other industrial areas.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "UV rays from ozone depletion do not significantly corrode marble. Global warming raises temperatures but does not directly cause the chemical corrosion described. Noise pollution causes hearing damage and stress, not chemical damage to stone. The specific chemical reaction between acid rain (from SO2 and NOx) and calcium carbonate in marble is what causes the discolouration and corrosion Meera reads about."

During photosynthesis, plants absorb CO2 from the atmosphere and use it along with water and sunlight to produce glucose and oxygen. Students commonly confuse this because plants also respire (which does release CO2), but photosynthesis itself is a carbon-fixing process that removes CO2 from the air. Respiration, fossil fuel combustion, and decomposition all release CO2.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Respiration by animals (A) releases CO2 as a byproduct of breaking down glucose for energy. Burning fossil fuels (B) releases stored carbon as CO2.

Students often confuse nitrogen gas (N2) with nitrous oxide (N2O), which IS a greenhouse gas. CO2, CH4, and N2O are all well-known greenhouse gases that trap heat in the atmosphere.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "CO2 (A) is the most well-known greenhouse gas released by burning fossil fuels. CH4 (B) is a potent greenhouse gas from paddy fields, cattle, and landfills. N2O (D) is a greenhouse gas from agricultural activities and fossil fuel combustion. Only N2 (C) is not a greenhouse gas — it is chemically inert and does not trap heat.

Only about 10% of the energy from one trophic level is transferred to the next. This means producers always have the most energy, followed by decreasing amounts at each successive consumer level. This thermodynamic reality ensures the pyramid can never be inverted.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because body size does not determine energy pyramids — some producers (phytoplankton) are much smaller than their consumers. Option C is incorrect because the number of species does not directly determine energy availability. Option D is wrong because consumers cannot eat more than what is available; they always receive less energy than the level below them. The real reason is the progressive loss of energy as heat at each level."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Eutrophication leads to fish death through oxygen depletion. When excess nutrients (nitrates, phosphates) cause algal bloom, the algae eventually die in large numbers. Decomposing bacteria then break down this dead algal matter, consuming large amounts of dissolved oxygen in the process. This creates a condition called hypoxia (low oxygen), where dissolved oxygen levels drop so low that fish and other aquatic organisms cannot breathe and die. This is the primary mechanism of fish death in eutrophication.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because most algae in eutrophication are not directly poisonous — the problem is oxygen depletion. Option C is wrong because while algae can block sunlight, the primary cause of death is not inability to see food but lack of oxygen. Option D is incorrect because the nutrients themselves (at the levels typically found) do not directly poison fish. The real reason is the oxygen consumption by bacteria decomposing dead algae."
