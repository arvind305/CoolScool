    "text": "An ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with their physical environment. Components include biotic (producers, consumers, decomposers) and abiotic (temperature, light, water, soil) factors. Energy flows through food chains and food webs, with only about 10% transferred between trophic levels. Biogeochemical cycles (carbon, nitrogen, water, oxygen) recycle matter through ecosystems. Environmental pollution includes air, water, soil, and noise pollution. Biodiversity encompasses genetic, species, and ecosystem diversity. Conservation strategies include in-situ (national parks, sanctuaries) and ex-situ (zoos, botanical gardens) methods. Global issues include climate change, ozone depletion, and acid rain.",
    "rules": [
      "Ecosystem = biotic community + abiotic environment",
      "Producers are autotrophs that make their own food through photosynthesis",
      "Consumers are heterotrophs: primary (herbivores), secondary (carnivores), tertiary (top predators)",
      "Energy transfer follows the 10% rule between trophic levels",
      "Carbon cycle: photosynthesis fixes CO2; respiration and decomposition release it",
      "Nitrogen cycle involves fixation, nitrification, assimilation, and denitrification",
      "Air pollution: caused by vehicles and industries; effects include respiratory diseases",
      "Water pollution: caused by sewage and industrial waste; leads to eutrophication",
      "Biodiversity hotspots are areas with high species diversity but threatened habitats",

      "explanation_correct": "Energy is not recycled in an ecosystem like matter. Instead, energy flows through the ecosystem in a one-way direction, with only about 10% of the energy being transferred from one trophic level to the next. The rest of the energy is lost as heat.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "It is a common misconception that energy is recycled in an ecosystem like matter. However, this is not the case. Energy enters the ecosystem through producers (like plants) and flows through the food chain, but it is not recycled. Instead, energy is continuously lost as heat at each trophic level, and new energy must enter the system through photosynthesis."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement is true. Although the atmosphere is about 78% nitrogen gas, this form of nitrogen cannot be directly used by most plants. Plants can only absorb nitrogen from the soil, typically in the form of nitrates or ammonium compounds, which are produced by specialized bacteria or the decomposition of organic matter."

      "explanation_correct": "Burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas releases carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. This added CO2 contributes to the greenhouse effect and global warming, which are important environmental issues today.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Some people may think that burning fossil fuels does not affect the atmosphere, but this is not correct. Fossil fuels contain stored carbon, and when they are burned, this carbon is released into the air as carbon dioxide. This extra CO2 in the atmosphere traps heat and leads to climate change, so burning fossil fuels definitely adds CO2 to the atmosphere."

Air pollution can cause a variety of health problems, such as respiratory issues, heart disease, and even cancer.

      "correct_answer": true,
      "explanation_correct": "Eutrophication, which is the excessive growth of algae and plants in water bodies due to high nutrient levels, can lead to oxygen depletion in the water. This is because the decomposition of the dead algae and plants uses up a lot of oxygen, leaving very little oxygen available for other aquatic organisms, which can then die due to lack of oxygen.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Eutrophication does not lead to oxygen increase in water. Instead, it causes a decrease in oxygen levels. This is because the excess growth of algae and plants uses up a lot of oxygen during the day for photosynthesis, and at night, the same algae and plants use up even more oxygen during respiration. This leaves very little oxygen available for other aquatic organisms, causing them to die due to lack of oxygen."

When we lose different species and genetic diversity within an ecosystem, it can disrupt the balance of the system and make it less resilient to changes in the environment. Biodiversity is important for maintaining the proper functioning of an ecosystem.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Biodiversity loss can actually have a major impact on the stability of an ecosystem. When we lose different species and genetic diversity, it can disrupt the balance of the system and make it less able to cope with changes in the environment. Ecosystems with high biodiversity are generally more stable and resilient than those with low biodiversity."

This is the main driver of global warming today.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "It is a common misconception that global warming is caused only by natural processes.

The term 'ecosystem' describes this whole system of living and non-living components working together.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The term 'ecosystem' is the accepted answer because it describes a community of living organisms interacting with their physical environment.
