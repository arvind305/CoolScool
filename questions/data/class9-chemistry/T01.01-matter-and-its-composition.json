    "text": "Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. According to kinetic particle theory, matter is made of tiny particles in constant motion. States of matter can be interconverted by changing temperature or pressure. Latent heat is the energy absorbed or released during state change at constant temperature. Specific latent heat of fusion is energy needed to change 1 kg of solid to liquid at melting point. Specific latent heat of vaporization is energy needed to change 1 kg of liquid to gas at boiling point. Diffusion is the movement of particles from high to low concentration. Brownian motion (random zigzag movement of particles) provides evidence for kinetic theory.",

      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is 'Heating ice', 'Melting', 'Heating water', 'Boiling', 'Heating steam' because this follows the sequence of state changes that occur when heating ice to produce steam. First, the solid ice is heated until it reaches the melting point, then it melts into liquid water, which is then further heated to reach the boiling point, converting it into gaseous steam, which is then heated further.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be something like 'Heating ice', 'Boiling', 'Melting', 'Heating water', 'Heating steam'. This is wrong because the states of matter don't change in that order - solid ice first melts into liquid water before it can boil and turn into steam. The correct sequence is to first heat the solid ice until it reaches the melting point, then it melts into liquid water, which is then further heated until it reaches the boiling point and turns into gaseous steam, which is then heated further."

This is because the particles in gases have the highest kinetic energy and move around freely, while the particles in solids are closely packed and have the least freedom of movement.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Gas, Solid, Liquid. This is because gases have the highest rate of diffusion, as their particles have the highest kinetic energy and move around freely. Solids, on the other hand, have particles that are closely packed and have the least freedom of movement, resulting in a slower rate of diffusion. Liquids have a faster rate of diffusion than solids, as their particles have more freedom of movement compared to the particles in solids."

This is because in solids, the particles are most closely packed together, in liquids the particles have a larger intermolecular distance, and in gases the particles have the largest intermolecular distance. The incorrect order would be Liquid, Solid, Gas, as the intermolecular distance increases from solid to liquid to gas."

This is wrong because the energy required to change from solid to liquid (fusion) is less than the energy needed to just heat water by 1°C, which is less than the energy required to change from liquid to gas (vaporization)."
