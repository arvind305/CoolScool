    "text": "Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. According to kinetic particle theory, matter is made of tiny particles in constant motion. States of matter can be interconverted by changing temperature or pressure. Latent heat is the energy absorbed or released during state change at constant temperature. Specific latent heat of fusion is energy needed to change 1 kg of solid to liquid at melting point. Specific latent heat of vaporization is energy needed to change 1 kg of liquid to gas at boiling point. Diffusion is the movement of particles from high to low concentration. Brownian motion (random zigzag movement of particles) provides evidence for kinetic theory.",

This energy changes the state from solid to liquid without increasing the kinetic energy of the particles, so the temperature remains constant until all the ice has melted.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because the thermometer is working properly — the constant temperature is a real physical phenomenon during phase change. Option C is incorrect because the flame is continuously providing heat; it is just being used to change the state rather than raise the temperature. Option D is incorrect because the heat is being absorbed by the ice to melt, not by the surrounding air."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "At high altitudes like Ladakh (3500 m), the atmospheric pressure is significantly lower than at sea level. Since boiling point decreases with decreasing pressure, water boils at a temperature well below 100°C (approximately 87-90°C at that altitude). This lower temperature means the eggs do not receive enough heat to cook properly, even though the water is boiling vigorously.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because the eggs being cold is not the issue — the problem is the lower boiling point of water. Option C is incorrect because the water does boil, but at a lower temperature. Option D is incorrect because water absolutely can boil at high altitudes — in fact, it boils more easily because the atmospheric pressure is lower."

In a sealed container (constant volume), the faster-moving particles collide with the container walls more frequently and with greater force, resulting in an increase in pressure. This is the direct relationship between temperature and pressure at constant volume.",
