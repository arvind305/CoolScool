    "text": "According to Bohr's model, electrons revolve around the nucleus in fixed orbits (K, L, M, N shells) with definite energy. Maximum electrons per shell is 2n2. Atoms achieve stability by attaining noble gas configuration (8 electrons in outer shell - octet rule, or 2 for hydrogen/helium - duplet rule). Ionic bonding involves transfer of electrons from metal to non-metal, forming oppositely charged ions attracted by electrostatic force. Covalent bonding involves sharing of electrons between non-metal atoms. Electrovalency is the number of electrons transferred; covalency is the number of electrons shared.",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is K shell, L shell, M shell, N shell because the shells have increasing energy levels, with the K shell being the lowest energy and the N shell being the highest energy. This is based on Bohr's model of the atom, which states that electrons orbit the nucleus in fixed energy levels or shells.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be something like M shell, N shell, K shell, L shell. This is not correct because the shells have a specific order of increasing energy levels, from the lowest K shell to the highest N shell. The electrons occupy the lower energy levels first before moving to the higher energy levels as per the Bohr model of the atom."

Therefore, the correct order from smallest to largest maximum electron capacity is: K shell, L shell, M shell.",

The L shell has a higher capacity of 8, and the M shell has the highest capacity of 18 electrons. The order should be arranged from the shell with the smallest maximum capacity to the one with the largest."

This is because in ionic bonding, atoms transfer electrons to achieve a stable noble gas configuration, forming positive and negative ions, which are then attracted to each other by the electrostatic force.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect explanation would be: 1) Cl gains electron to form Cl-, 2) Na loses electron to form Na+, and 3) Electrostatic attraction between ions. This is wrong because the atoms first need to lose or gain electrons to form ions, and then the oppositely charged ions are attracted to each other by the electrostatic force. The order of the steps is important to understand how ionic bonds are formed."
