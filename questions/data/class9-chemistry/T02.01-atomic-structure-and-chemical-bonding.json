    "text": "According to Bohr's model, electrons revolve around the nucleus in fixed orbits (K, L, M, N shells) with definite energy. Maximum electrons per shell is 2n2. Atoms achieve stability by attaining noble gas configuration (8 electrons in outer shell - octet rule, or 2 for hydrogen/helium - duplet rule). Ionic bonding involves transfer of electrons from metal to non-metal, forming oppositely charged ions attracted by electrostatic force. Covalent bonding involves sharing of electrons between non-metal atoms. Electrovalency is the number of electrons transferred; covalency is the number of electrons shared.",
