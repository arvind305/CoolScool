    "text": "The periodic table evolved from Dobereiner's triads (groups of three similar elements) to Newlands' law of octaves (every 8th element similar) to Mendeleev's table (arranged by atomic mass). The modern periodic law states that properties of elements are periodic functions of their atomic numbers. The long form has 7 periods (horizontal rows showing shells) and 18 groups (vertical columns with same valence electrons). Elements are classified into s-block (Groups 1-2), p-block (Groups 13-18), d-block (Groups 3-12), and f-block (lanthanides and actinides). Periodic trends: atomic radius decreases across period, increases down group; ionization energy and electronegativity increase across period, decrease down group.",

This is because atomic radius decreases across a period from left to right as more protons are added, pulling the electrons closer to the nucleus. Fluorine has the smallest atomic radius, followed by Carbon, and then Lithium has the largest atomic radius in Period 2.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be Lithium, Carbon, Fluorine. This is wrong because atomic radius decreases from left to right across a period. Lithium, being the leftmost element in Period 2, has the largest atomic radius, followed by Carbon, and Fluorine has the smallest atomic radius in this period."
