    "text": "A chemical equation is a symbolic representation of a chemical reaction. The law of conservation of mass states that matter cannot be created or destroyed, so the number of atoms of each element must be equal on both sides of a balanced equation. Balancing is done by adjusting coefficients (not subscripts). Types of reactions include: combination (A + B -> AB), decomposition (AB -> A + B), single displacement (A + BC -> AC + B), and double displacement (AB + CD -> AD + CB). Balanced equations can be interpreted in terms of atoms, molecules, and moles.",

They are also not catalysts, which are substances that speed up a reaction but are not consumed in the process.

This is because photolytic decomposition uses the gentlest energy source - light, while thermal decomposition uses heat, and electrolytic decomposition uses the most energy-intensive method of electricity.",

This is incorrect because thermal decomposition uses a gentler energy source (heat) compared to photolytic decomposition which uses light energy. Electrolytic decomposition uses the most energy-intensive method of electricity, so it should be ordered last."

This is wrong because the arrow represents the direction of the reaction, and it should be placed between the reactants and the products, not before the reactants. The reactants must be listed first, followed by the arrow, and then the products."
