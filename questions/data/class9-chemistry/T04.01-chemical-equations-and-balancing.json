    "text": "A chemical equation is a symbolic representation of a chemical reaction. The law of conservation of mass states that matter cannot be created or destroyed, so the number of atoms of each element must be equal on both sides of a balanced equation. Balancing is done by adjusting coefficients (not subscripts). Types of reactions include: combination (A + B -> AB), decomposition (AB -> A + B), single displacement (A + BC -> AC + B), and double displacement (AB + CD -> AD + CB). Balanced equations can be interpreted in terms of atoms, molecules, and moles.",

      "Reactants are on the left, products on the right",

      "explanation_correct": "The substances on the left side of the arrow in a chemical equation are called the reactants. This is because they are the starting materials that undergo a chemical reaction to form the products on the right side of the arrow.",

They are also not catalysts, which are substances that speed up a reaction but are not consumed in the process. The coefficients are the numbers in front of the chemical formulas, which are used to balance the equation."
