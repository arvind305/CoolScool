      "explanation_correct": "The relative atomic mass is compared to 1/12 of the mass of the carbon-12 (12C) atom because the definition of relative atomic mass is based on the carbon-12 isotope. This is the standard used to measure the mass of all other atoms.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The relative atomic mass is not compared to the mass of a hydrogen-12 atom. It is specifically compared to 1/12 of the mass of the carbon-12 isotope, which is the standard reference for measuring atomic masses. The accepted answer format is 'carbon' as this refers to the carbon-12 atom used in the definition of relative atomic mass."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'mole'. The mole is the SI unit for amount of substance because it represents a specific number of particles (Avogadro's number, which is 6.022 x 10^23). Other units like grams or kilograms are used to measure mass, not the amount of a substance."

      "correct_answer": "40",
      "explanation_correct": "The molar mass of NaOH is 40 g/mol because the atomic masses of its elements are: sodium (Na) = 23 g/mol, oxygen (O) = 16 g/mol, and hydrogen (H) = 1 g/mol. Adding these up gives a total molar mass of 23 + 16 + 1 = 40 g/mol for the NaOH molecule.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is a single number, so 40 g/mol is the correct answer. The incorrect answer might be, for example, 23 g/mol, which is just the molar mass of the sodium (Na) atom. But this is not the complete molar mass of the NaOH molecule, which includes the oxygen (O) and hydrogen (H) atoms as well. The correct molar mass is found by adding up the individual atomic masses of all the elements in the NaOH molecule."

Since the molar mass is 180, the molecular formula must be C6H12O6, which is 6 times the empirical formula. This is because the molecular formula gives the actual number of atoms in the molecule.",

This is not correct because the molar mass of 180 tells us the molecular formula must be larger than the empirical formula.
