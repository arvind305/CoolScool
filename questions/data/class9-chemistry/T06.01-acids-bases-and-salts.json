The pH scale ranges from 0-14: pH 7 is neutral, below 7 is acidic, above 7 is basic. Strong acids (HCl, HNO3, H2SO4) completely dissociate; weak acids (CH3COOH, H2CO3) partially dissociate. Neutralization is the reaction between acid and base producing salt and water. Salts are classified as normal salts (all H+ replaced), acidic salts (some H+ remain), and basic salts (excess base).",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Lemon juice (pH 2), Pure water (pH 7), Milk (pH 6.5). This is wrong because lemon juice, with a pH of 2, is the most acidic substance, while pure water with a neutral pH of 7 is the least acidic. Milk, with a pH of 6.5, is in the middle of the range, making it more acidic than pure water but less acidic than lemon juice."

      "explanation_correct": "The ability of an acid to conduct electricity depends on the degree of dissociation of the acid in water. Strong acids like HCl completely dissociate, producing a high concentration of H+ ions which can conduct electricity well. Weak acids like CH3COOH partially dissociate, producing fewer H+ ions and thus conducting electricity less. Very weak acids like H2CO3 dissociate the least, producing the fewest H+ ions, and thus are the weakest conductors.",
