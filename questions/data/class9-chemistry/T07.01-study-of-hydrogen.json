    "text": "Hydrogen is the first element with atomic number 1 and electronic configuration 1s1. It has unique position in periodic table, resembling both Group 1 (loses electron to form H+) and Group 17 (gains electron to form H-). Its three isotopes are protium (1H), deuterium (2H or D), and tritium (3H or T). Laboratory preparation: Zn + dil. H2SO4 -> ZnSO4 + H2. It is collected by downward displacement of water. Properties: colorless, odorless, lightest gas, slightly soluble, burns with pop sound. Hydrogen acts as a reducing agent, reducing metal oxides like CuO + H2 -> Cu + H2O.",
