    "text": "Water (H2O) is a bent/angular molecule with bond angle 104.5 degrees. Hydrogen bonding between water molecules causes unique properties. Water has maximum density at 4 degrees C and expands on freezing (anomalous behavior), allowing ice to float and aquatic life to survive in frozen lakes. Water is called the universal solvent. It reacts with metals to form hydroxides, with non-metals to form acids. Hard water contains dissolved Ca/Mg salts: temporary hardness (bicarbonates) is removed by boiling; permanent hardness (sulfates, chlorides) is removed by adding washing soda or ion exchange.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect statement that 'water contracts when it freezes' is a common misconception. In reality, water has the anomalous property of expanding when it freezes. This is because the hydrogen bonding between water molecules causes the formation of a crystalline ice structure that takes up more volume compared to the liquid state.

This is because water has a maximum density at 4 degrees C, which is why aquatic life can survive in frozen lakes - the ice floats on top of the denser water underneath.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Water is most dense at 4 degrees C, because this is the temperature at which water molecules are most tightly packed. Ice at 0 degrees C is less dense than liquid water at 20 degrees C, because the expanded crystalline structure of ice takes up more space than the molecules in the liquid state."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Since the problem was solved by boiling, the water had temporary hardness. Temporary hardness is caused by dissolved bicarbonates of calcium and magnesium. On boiling, these bicarbonates decompose into insoluble carbonates, carbon dioxide, and water, effectively removing the hardness and allowing soap to lather normally. If it were permanent hardness, boiling would not have helped.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is wrong because permanent hardness (caused by sulfates and chlorides) cannot be removed by boiling. Option C is incorrect because the white scum forming with soap is a classic sign of hard water, not a soap defect. Option D is wrong because boiling does not remove permanent hardness; it only removes temporary hardness caused by bicarbonates."
