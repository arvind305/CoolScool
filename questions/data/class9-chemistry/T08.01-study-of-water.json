    "text": "Water (H2O) is a bent/angular molecule with bond angle 104.5 degrees. Hydrogen bonding between water molecules causes unique properties. Water has maximum density at 4 degrees C and expands on freezing (anomalous behavior), allowing ice to float and aquatic life to survive in frozen lakes. Water is called the universal solvent. It reacts with metals to form hydroxides, with non-metals to form acids. Hard water contains dissolved Ca/Mg salts: temporary hardness (bicarbonates) is removed by boiling; permanent hardness (sulfates, chlorides) is removed by adding washing soda or ion exchange.",

This is because the hydrogen bonding between water molecules causes the formation of a crystalline ice structure that takes up more volume compared to the liquid state.

This is because water has a maximum density at 4 degrees C, which is why aquatic life can survive in frozen lakes - the ice floats on top of the denser water underneath.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Water is most dense at 4 degrees C, because this is the temperature at which water molecules are most tightly packed. Ice at 0 degrees C is less dense than liquid water at 20 degrees C, because the expanded crystalline structure of ice takes up more space than the molecules in the liquid state."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The order of reactivity with water is not iron, magnesium, sodium. Sodium is the most reactive metal, as it has the weakest hold on its outermost electrons and easily gives them up to react with water. Magnesium is more reactive than iron, as it also has a relatively weak hold on its outermost electrons compared to iron."

While boiling can remove temporary hardness caused by bicarbonates, it does not remove permanent hardness from dissolved mineral salts like calcium and magnesium sulfates and chlorides.

This is wrong because you need to first add the slaked lime to the hard water to cause the precipitation of calcium carbonate, and then filter out the solid precipitate. Filtering the precipitate before adding the slaked lime would not work, as there would be no precipitate formed yet."
