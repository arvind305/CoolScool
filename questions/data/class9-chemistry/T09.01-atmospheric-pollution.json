    "text": "The atmosphere consists of N2 (78%), O2 (21%), Ar (0.93%), and CO2 (0.04%). Air pollutants include primary pollutants (CO, SO2, NOx, particulates) directly emitted and secondary pollutants (ozone, smog) formed by reactions. Greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, CFCs) trap infrared radiation causing global warming. The ozone layer in stratosphere protects from UV radiation; CFCs cause ozone depletion. Acid rain forms when SO2 and NOx react with water vapor to form H2SO4 and HNO3, damaging buildings, forests, and aquatic life. Control measures include catalytic converters, scrubbers, and alternative fuels.",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order of greenhouse gases by global warming potential is: Carbon dioxide, Methane, CFCs. Carbon dioxide has the lowest global warming potential, followed by methane, and then CFCs which have the highest global warming potential.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct order is Carbon dioxide, Methane, CFCs. This is because carbon dioxide has the lowest global warming potential, meaning it traps the least amount of infrared radiation and causes the least amount of global warming. Methane has a higher global warming potential than carbon dioxide, and CFCs have the highest global warming potential of the three."

This is because the SO2 from power plants first reacts with water vapor in the air to form sulfurous acid (H2SO3), and then this acid falls down as acid rain.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Acid falls as rain, SO2 released from power plants, SO2 reacts with water vapor to form H2SO3. This is wrong because the acid rain cannot fall first before the SO2 is released and reacts with water vapor to form the sulfurous acid. The correct sequence is that the SO2 is released, it reacts to form the acid, and then the acid falls as rain."
