    "text": "The atmosphere consists of N2 (78%), O2 (21%), Ar (0.93%), and CO2 (0.04%). Air pollutants include primary pollutants (CO, SO2, NOx, particulates) directly emitted and secondary pollutants (ozone, smog) formed by reactions. Greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O, CFCs) trap infrared radiation causing global warming. The ozone layer in stratosphere protects from UV radiation; CFCs cause ozone depletion. Acid rain forms when SO2 and NOx react with water vapor to form H2SO4 and HNO3, damaging buildings, forests, and aquatic life. Control measures include catalytic converters, scrubbers, and alternative fuels.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation_correct": "The scenario describes carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning. Incomplete combustion of coal in a poorly ventilated room produces CO, which is colourless and odourless. CO binds with haemoglobin about 200 times more strongly than oxygen, forming carboxyhaemoglobin, which reduces the blood's oxygen-carrying capacity. This causes headache, dizziness, and in severe cases, can be fatal.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "SO2 has a sharp, pungent smell, so it would be noticed. CO2 does not bind with haemoglobin in the same dangerous way and would not cause these symptoms at typical indoor levels. Nitrogen is an inert gas that makes up 78% of the atmosphere and is not a pollutant. The combination of incomplete combustion, poor ventilation, and haemoglobin-binding points directly to carbon monoxide."

Scrubbers are pollution control devices fitted in industrial chimneys that spray a liquid (often a limestone-water mixture) into the flue gases.

This would help reduce the haze and respiratory problems caused by factory emissions.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "A catalytic converter is used in vehicles, not factory chimneys. Afforestation (planting trees) is a long-term measure, not a device installed in a chimney. Alternative fuels replace the fuel source entirely rather than cleaning the exhaust. The description of a liquid-spray device in a chimney specifically identifies a scrubber."

Ozone depletion is caused by substances containing chlorine and bromine, such as CFCs, halons, and carbon tetrachloride.",
