    "text": "Laboratory safety includes wearing protective equipment, handling chemicals carefully, and knowing emergency procedures. The Bunsen burner has three flame types: luminous (yellow, sooty), non-luminous (blue, hottest), and safety flame. Gas preparation involves specific reactions: H2 from Zn + acid, O2 from H2O2 + MnO2, CO2 from CaCO3 + HCl. Gas tests: H2 burns with pop, O2 relights glowing splint, CO2 turns lime water milky, NH3 turns red litmus blue and gives white fumes with HCl. Crystallization is used to purify solids by dissolving in hot solvent and cooling.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The luminous yellow flame is not the hottest because it has a lower temperature compared to the non-luminous blue flame. The luminous yellow flame is caused by the presence of unburnt particles, which makes it appear yellow and sooty. The safety flame is also not the hottest, as it is designed to be a lower temperature for safety reasons."

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "In crystallization, the rate of cooling determines crystal size. The surface of the solution is exposed to air and cools faster than the bulk solution. Rapid cooling produces many small, powder-like crystals because crystal nuclei form quickly without time to grow into large, well-formed structures. The larger crystals at the bottom formed from the slower, more gradual cooling of the deeper solution.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Incorrect filtration (option A) would leave insoluble impurities, not cause different crystal sizes. If the sample were already pure (option C), crystallization would still produce crystals of uniform quality. Contamination (option D) would likely produce crystals of a different colour or shape entirely. The difference in crystal size is explained by uneven cooling rates within the solution."

Personal belongings should be moved away from the spill to prevent damage, but the student should not attempt to clean up a concentrated acid spill themselves. The teacher will use appropriate neutralising agents and safety procedures.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is risky because reaching over or near a spreading acid spill to grab belongings could result in skin contact with the acid. Option C is extremely dangerous because touching concentrated acid with bare hands can cause severe chemical burns. Option D is wrong because concentrated HCl is corrosive and will damage the bench surface and any materials it contacts; it does not simply evaporate harmlessly."

The copper acts as a positive catalyst by facilitating electron transfer in the reaction between zinc and the acid.",

Option C is wrong because the small amount of copper sulphate does not significantly change the temperature. Option D is partially true in that zinc does displace copper, but the hydrogen gas comes from the zinc-acid reaction, not from copper sulphate directly. The catalytic effect is due to the galvanic couple formed."

Oxygen (option B) is also sparingly soluble and is commonly collected by the downward displacement of water.

In reality, when moist blue litmus is exposed to chlorine, the paper first turns red because chlorine dissolves in the moisture to form hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hypochlorous acid (HOCl), both of which are acidic. The hypochlorous acid then acts as a powerful oxidising agent that bleaches the litmus dye, turning it white. This two-step process is commonly tested in ICSE exams.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option B is wrong because chlorine is acidic in water, not alkaline, so it would never turn litmus blue. Option C is incorrect because chlorine dissolved in water is acidic, not neutral. Option D is wrong because chlorine reacts vigorously with water to form HCl and HOCl. The correct answer recognises the two-step process of first acidic colour change (red) then bleaching (white)."
