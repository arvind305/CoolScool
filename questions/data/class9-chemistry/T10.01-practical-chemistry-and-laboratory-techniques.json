    "text": "Laboratory safety includes wearing protective equipment, handling chemicals carefully, and knowing emergency procedures. The Bunsen burner has three flame types: luminous (yellow, sooty), non-luminous (blue, hottest), and safety flame. Gas preparation involves specific reactions: H2 from Zn + acid, O2 from H2O2 + MnO2, CO2 from CaCO3 + HCl. Gas tests: H2 burns with pop, O2 relights glowing splint, CO2 turns lime water milky, NH3 turns red litmus blue and gives white fumes with HCl. Crystallization is used to purify solids by dissolving in hot solvent and cooling.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The luminous yellow flame is not the hottest because it has a lower temperature compared to the non-luminous blue flame. The luminous yellow flame is caused by the presence of unburnt particles, which makes it appear yellow and sooty. The safety flame is also not the hottest, as it is designed to be a lower temperature for safety reasons."

        "Safety flame",

      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The non-luminous blue flame of the Bunsen burner is the hottest, followed by the luminous yellow flame, and then the safety flame which is the coolest. This is because the non-luminous blue flame has more oxygen mixing with the gas, leading to a hotter, cleaner combustion.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The order from coolest to hottest is incorrect. The safety flame, which is a small blue flame, is the coolest. The luminous yellow flame, which is sooty, is hotter than the safety flame. The non-luminous blue flame is the hottest as it has more oxygen mixing with the gas, leading to a cleaner and hotter combustion."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct order is Hydrogen, Ammonia, Carbon dioxide, Chlorine. This is because hydrogen is the lightest gas, followed by ammonia, carbon dioxide, and chlorine. The density of a gas depends on its molecular weight, and hydrogen has the lowest molecular weight among the given gases."

This is the safest response as it quickly removes the acid from the skin, preventing further damage.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be to first report the incident to the teacher, then remove the contaminated clothing, and finally wash the affected area. This is not the correct order because the priority should be to immediately wash the skin with water to remove the acid, before addressing other steps. Reporting the incident can wait until after the skin has been cleaned."
