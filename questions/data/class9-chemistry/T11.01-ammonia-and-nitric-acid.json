    "text": "Ammonia (NH3) is prepared in lab by heating ammonium chloride with calcium hydroxide: 2NH4Cl + Ca(OH)2 -> CaCl2 + 2H2O + 2NH3. It is a colorless gas with pungent smell, lighter than air, extremely soluble in water. Ammonia is basic, turns red litmus blue, and forms white fumes (NH4Cl) with HCl. Industrial preparation uses Haber process: N2 + 3H2 <-> 2NH3 (conditions: 450C, 200 atm, iron catalyst). Nitric acid is prepared by Ostwald process. It is a strong oxidizing acid that attacks most metals. Uses include fertilizers, explosives, and dyes.",

      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The correct order for maximum ammonia yield in the Haber process is high pressure, moderate temperature, and the use of a catalyst. This is because high pressure drives the equilibrium towards the products, moderate temperature increases the rate of the reaction without reducing the equilibrium yield, and the catalyst helps speed up the reaction without being consumed.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be moderate temperature, use of catalyst, and high pressure. While moderate temperature and the use of a catalyst are important, the high pressure is the most crucial factor for maximizing ammonia production in the Haber process. Without the high pressure, the equilibrium would shift towards the reactants, resulting in a lower yield of ammonia."

      ],
      "explanation_correct": "The most important use of ammonia is in the manufacture of fertilizers, as it is a key ingredient in many fertilizers. This is the largest scale application of ammonia. Ammonia's use as a refrigerant is also significant but smaller in scale compared to its use in fertilizers. Household cleaning is a relatively minor use of ammonia compared to the other two.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct order from largest to smallest scale is: Fertilizer manufacture, Refrigerant, Household cleaning. Fertilizer manufacture is the most important use of ammonia because it is a critical component in many fertilizers, which are produced on a massive industrial scale to meet global agricultural needs. Refrigerant and household cleaning are smaller-scale applications of ammonia in comparison."
