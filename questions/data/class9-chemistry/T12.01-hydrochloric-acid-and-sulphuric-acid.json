It reacts with metals to produce H2, with carbonates to produce CO2, and with bases to form salts. Test: white precipitate with AgNO3. Sulphuric acid (H2SO4) is manufactured by Contact process. Concentrated H2SO4 is a strong dehydrating and oxidizing agent, chars organic matter. Dilute H2SO4 shows typical acid properties. SAFETY: Always add acid to water, never water to acid.",

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is to first take cold water in a beaker, then add the concentrated sulphuric acid slowly while stirring, and finally allow the mixture to cool. This is the safest way to dilute sulphuric acid, as adding water to acid can cause the solution to heat up rapidly and splatter, which is dangerous.",

The correct order is to first take cold water in a beaker, then add the concentrated sulphuric acid slowly while stirring, and finally allow the mixture to cool. This ensures that the acid is properly diluted without causing any hazardous reactions."

      "explanation_correct": "The order of these acids by basicity is HCl, H2SO4, H3PO4. HCl is a monobasic acid, meaning it has one acidic hydrogen atom. H2SO4 is a dibasic acid with two acidic hydrogen atoms, while H3PO4 is a tribasic acid with three acidic hydrogen atoms. Therefore, the order from most basic (monobasic) to least basic is HCl, H2SO4, H3PO4.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be H2SO4, H3PO4, HCl. This is wrong because HCl is a monobasic acid, meaning it has only one acidic hydrogen atom, while H2SO4 and H3PO4 are dibasic and tribasic acids, respectively, with more acidic hydrogen atoms. The correct order from most basic (monobasic) to least basic is HCl, H2SO4, H3PO4."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct order is: Add concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4) to sodium chloride (NaCl), then heat the mixture gently, and finally collect the hydrogen chloride (HCl) gas produced. This is because the reaction between NaCl and H2SO4 generates HCl gas, which needs to be collected after the reaction takes place.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: 'Collect HCl gas, Heat gently, Add conc. H2SO4 to NaCl'. This is wrong because you need to start by adding the reactants (NaCl and H2SO4) to initiate the reaction, then heat the mixture to produce the HCl gas, and finally collect the gas. The order of the steps is important to ensure the reaction occurs correctly and the HCl gas is produced."

While battery acid is a significant use of H2SO4, it is much smaller in scale compared to the massive amounts used in fertilizer and detergent production."
