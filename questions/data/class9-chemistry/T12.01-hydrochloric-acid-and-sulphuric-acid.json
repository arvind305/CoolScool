At higher temperatures, the reaction rate increases but the equilibrium yield of SO3 decreases, so the intermediate temperature of 450°C is chosen as the best compromise.",

C) Lower temperatures are not unsafe, but they reduce the reaction rate and equilibrium yield of SO3. D) The catalyst works across a range of temperatures, not just at 450°C, so this is not the reason for the chosen temperature."

The sugar (C12H22O11) turned black because concentrated sulphuric acid removed water from it, leaving behind carbon: C12H22O11 -> 12C + 11H2O. The spongy black mass is carbon. This is the classic dehydration reaction that demonstrates concentrated H2SO4's powerful dehydrating property.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Dilute HCl does not char sugar as it lacks dehydrating properties. Dilute H2SO4 shows typical acid properties but not dehydration. While concentrated HNO3 is an oxidising agent, the specific observation of sugar charring into a black spongy mass is characteristic of concentrated H2SO4 acting as a dehydrating agent."

This is because the dissolution is highly exothermic, and adding water to acid can cause localised boiling and dangerous splattering due to the high heat generated.",
