The SI system has seven base units: metre (length), kilogram (mass), second (time), ampere (current), kelvin (temperature), mole (amount of substance), and candela (luminous intensity). Derived units are combinations of base units. The vernier caliper measures lengths with a least count of 0.01 cm using a main scale and sliding vernier scale. The screw gauge (micrometer) measures with a least count of 0.01 mm using a rotating circular scale. Zero error occurs when the instrument doesn't read zero when it should, and must be corrected. Significant figures indicate measurement precision.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "If the screw gauge has a negative zero error, the observed reading will be less than the true value. To correct this, you need to add the observed reading to the true value.

      "correct_answer": "-3",
      "explanation_correct": "The prefix 'milli' represents 10 raised to the power -3, which means one-thousandth. This is because the metric system uses prefixes to indicate multiples or fractions of a base unit, and 'milli' specifically indicates one-thousandth of the original unit.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is -3, because the prefix 'milli' represents a factor of one-thousandth. This is written as 10^-3, which means 10 raised to the power of -3. The 'milli' prefix is used to represent smaller units, such as millimetre (mm) which is one-thousandth of a metre."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is Watt (W), which is the SI unit of power. Power is defined as the rate of energy transfer, so its unit is energy (joule, J) divided by time (second, s). Mistakenly, some students may think that power has a different unit, but the SI system clearly defines the watt as the standard unit for measuring power."
