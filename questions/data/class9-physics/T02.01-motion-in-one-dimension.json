    "text": "Motion is described using distance (total path length), displacement (shortest path between two points), speed (rate of change of distance), and velocity (rate of change of displacement). Uniform motion has constant velocity, while non-uniform motion has changing velocity. Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity. Three equations of motion relate initial velocity (u), final velocity (v), acceleration (a), displacement (s), and time (t): v = u + at, s = ut + (1/2)at^2, and v^2 = u^2 + 2as. Graphical analysis of motion uses distance-time and velocity-time graphs.",
