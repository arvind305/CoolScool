    "text": "Newton's three laws of motion describe how objects move. The first law (law of inertia) states that an object remains at rest or in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force. Inertia is the tendency to resist change in motion, and mass measures inertia. The second law states that force equals mass times acceleration (F = ma) and relates to momentum (p = mv). The third law states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The law of conservation of momentum states that total momentum remains constant in absence of external forces. Friction opposes relative motion between surfaces.",

      "correct_answer": "recoil",
      "explanation_correct": "When a gun fires a bullet, the bullet is pushed forward by the explosive force. According to Newton's third law, the gun is pushed backward with an equal and opposite force, which is called the recoil. This recoil of the gun is a result of the action and reaction forces between the gun and the bullet.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'recoil'. The backward movement of the gun when a bullet is fired is not called 'kickback' or 'backlash'. It is specifically referred to as the 'recoil' of the gun, which is an application of Newton's third law of motion. Recoil is the backward movement of the gun due to the forward momentum of the bullet fired."

      "explanation_correct": "Static friction is the greatest because it opposes the initial movement of an object. Sliding friction is less than static friction because once an object is in motion, there is less resistance. Rolling friction is the least because it involves the least amount of surface contact and resistance as an object rolls along a surface.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct order from greatest to least friction is static friction, sliding friction, and then rolling friction. This is because static friction requires the most force to overcome the initial resistance before an object can start moving. Sliding friction is less than static friction since there is less resistance once an object is already in motion. Rolling friction is the least because there is even less surface contact and resistance as an object rolls along a surface."
