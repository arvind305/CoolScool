      "explanation_correct": "If the distance between two masses is tripled, the gravitational force between them will decrease by a factor of 9 (1/3^2 = 1/9). This is because the gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the masses, as per Newton's law of gravitation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 1/9. This is because the gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the masses. If the distance is tripled, the force will decrease by a factor of 1/3^2 = 1/9. So, if the distance is tripled, the gravitational force becomes 1/9 of the original force."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The velocity at the maximum height is zero. When an object is thrown upward, its velocity gradually decreases due to the downward pull of gravity. At the highest point, the upward velocity becomes zero before it starts falling back down. This is because the acceleration due to gravity acts in the downward direction."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The value of g is not maximum at the equator. The correct answer is that g is maximum at the poles of the Earth. This is because the Earth is not a perfect sphere, but rather bulges slightly at the equator due to its rotation.

Option B is incorrect because projectile motion involves both horizontal and vertical components, whereas the described motion is purely vertical.

      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation_correct": "Mass and weight are fundamentally different physical quantities. Mass is the amount of matter in a body, measured in kilograms (kg), which is a base SI unit. Weight is the gravitational force on a body (W = mg), measured in Newtons (N), which is a derived SI unit of force. Saying 'my mass is 60 kilograms-force' incorrectly mixes a mass value with a force unit. In everyday language, 'I weigh 60 kg' is imprecise — scientifically, one should say 'my mass is 60 kg' or 'my weight is about 588 N'.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option B is incorrect because kilogram is the SI unit of mass, and mass is correctly expressed in kilograms. Option C is irrelevant — 60 kg is a perfectly normal mass for a person. Option D is incorrect because mass (in kg) and weight (in N) have very different numerical values: a 60 kg person has a weight of about 588 N on Earth."
