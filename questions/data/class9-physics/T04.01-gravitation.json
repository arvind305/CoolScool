      "correct_answer": "1/9",
      "explanation_correct": "If the distance between two masses is tripled, the gravitational force between them will decrease by a factor of 9 (1/3^2 = 1/9). This is because the gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the masses, as per Newton's law of gravitation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 1/9. This is because the gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the masses. If the distance is tripled, the force will decrease by a factor of 1/3^2 = 1/9. So, if the distance is tripled, the gravitational force becomes 1/9 of the original force."

      "correct_answer": "zero",
      "explanation_correct": "The velocity of a body thrown upward becomes zero at the maximum height. This is because at the highest point, the upward motion stops and the downward motion under gravity begins.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The velocity at the maximum height is zero. When an object is thrown upward, its velocity gradually decreases due to the downward pull of gravity. At the highest point, the upward velocity becomes zero before it starts falling back down. This is because the acceleration due to gravity acts in the downward direction."

      "correct_answer": "poles",
      "explanation_correct": "The value of g is maximum at the poles because the Earth is not a perfect sphere - it bulges slightly at the equator due to its rotation. This means the surface of the Earth is slightly closer to the center of the Earth at the poles, resulting in a higher gravitational pull and acceleration due to gravity at the poles compared to other locations.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The value of g is not maximum at the equator. The correct answer is that g is maximum at the poles of the Earth. This is because the Earth is not a perfect sphere, but rather bulges slightly at the equator due to its rotation. This means the surface of the Earth is slightly closer to the center of the Earth at the poles, resulting in a higher gravitational pull and acceleration due to gravity at the poles compared to other locations on the Earth's surface."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The SI unit of weight is not Newton. Weight is the force exerted on an object due to gravity, and its SI unit is Newton. Mass, on the other hand, is the amount of matter in an object and its SI unit is kilogram. So the correct answer is that the SI unit of mass is kilogram."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: Sea level at equator, Sea level at poles, Mount Everest, Deep mine. This is incorrect because g increases with depth (deep mine) and decreases with altitude (Mount Everest). Additionally, g is slightly higher at the poles compared to the equator due to the Earth's rotation and shape."

Then, the ball starts falling back down.",

This is wrong because the velocity is maximum at the start of the upward motion, not when the ball reaches the highest point. The velocity becomes zero at the highest point, not before that."
