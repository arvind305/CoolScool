      "correct_answer": "upthrust",
      "explanation_correct": "When an object is submerged in a fluid like water, the fluid exerts an upward buoyant force on the object. This upward force, called the 'upthrust', reduces the apparent weight of the object. Therefore, the apparent weight of a submerged body equals its true weight minus the upthrust acting on it.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The 'upthrust' is the upward buoyant force exerted by the fluid on the submerged object. This upthrust acts to reduce the apparent weight of the object. The correct answer is 'upthrust', which is the force that needs to be subtracted from the object's true weight to get its apparent weight when submerged."

This buoyant force, as described by Archimedes' principle, depends on the density of the liquid. By measuring the buoyancy, the hydrometer can determine the relative density of the liquid compared to water.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 'hydrometer'. A hydrometer is a device used to measure the relative density of liquids. It works by measuring the buoyant force on an object submerged in the liquid, which depends on the liquid's density. This allows the hydrometer to determine how dense the liquid is compared to water. Other devices like a thermometer or barometer would not be able to measure the relative density of liquids."

Atmospheric pressure is an important factor in weather forecasting and understanding air movement, so measuring it accurately with a barometer is crucial.",

      "explanation_correct": "In a hydraulic lift, the mechanical advantage is equal to the ratio of the areas of the larger piston to the smaller piston. This is because pressure is transmitted equally in all directions in an enclosed fluid, as stated by Pascal's law. The larger piston experiences a larger force due to its larger area, which is then translated to a larger lifting force on the smaller piston.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The mechanical advantage in a hydraulic lift is not equal to the ratio of the areas of the smaller piston to the larger piston. This is because the mechanical advantage is determined by the ratio of the larger piston's area to the smaller piston's area, as per Pascal's law. The larger piston experiences a greater force, which is then transmitted equally throughout the fluid and results in a greater lifting force on the smaller piston."
