Kinetic energy KE = (1/2)mv^2 is energy due to motion. Potential energy PE = mgh is energy due to position. The work-energy theorem states that work done equals change in kinetic energy. The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted. Power is the rate of doing work: P = W/t = F x v.

Therefore, the falling ball experiences positive work while the upward ball experiences negative work from gravity.",

      "explanation_correct": "The PE decreased by 500 J but KE only increased by 450 J, meaning 50 J of energy was lost. In a perfectly isolated system, all the lost PE would convert to KE. The 50 J difference indicates energy was dissipated to the surroundings, likely as heat due to friction or air resistance, making it a non-isolated system with energy loss.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "A perfectly isolated system would show equal decrease in PE and increase in KE due to conservation of energy. Here, PE loss exceeds KE gain, indicating some energy left the system. This is not impossible but rather a common real-world scenario where friction or other dissipative forces convert mechanical energy to thermal energy."
