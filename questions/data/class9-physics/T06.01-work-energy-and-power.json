Kinetic energy KE = (1/2)mv^2 is energy due to motion. Potential energy PE = mgh is energy due to position. The work-energy theorem states that work done equals change in kinetic energy. The law of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted. Power is the rate of doing work: P = W/t = F x v.

      "correct_answer": "kinetic",
      "explanation_correct": "The work-energy theorem states that the work done on an object equals the change in the object's kinetic energy. This means that the work done causes the kinetic energy of the object to change, so the correct answer is 'kinetic'.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be 'potential', as potential energy is the energy an object has due to its position or configuration, not its motion. The work-energy theorem specifically relates the work done to the change in kinetic energy, not potential energy. The correct answer is 'kinetic' energy."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is '0', which is correct. When the force and displacement are perpendicular, the angle between them is 90 degrees. In the formula for work, W = F x s x cos(theta), the cosine of 90 degrees is 0. This means that the work done is zero in this case, and the answer '0' is the correct one."

      "explanation_correct": "Power is the rate of doing work, which means the amount of work done per unit time. The formula for power is P = W/t, where W is the work done and t is the time taken. Since work is force times displacement, we can rewrite the formula as P = F × v, where v is the velocity of the object. Therefore, power can be expressed as force times velocity.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect arrangement would be to order the velocities from highest to lowest (4 m/s, 3 m/s, 2 m/s, 1 m/s). This is wrong because kinetic energy is proportional to the square of the velocity, not the velocity itself. So the correct order from lowest to highest kinetic energy is 1 m/s, 2 m/s, 3 m/s, 4 m/s."

At the lowest point, the pendulum has the most kinetic energy, as it is moving at its fastest speed. As it moves away from the lowest point towards the left or right extreme, its kinetic energy decreases and potential energy increases."
