    "text": "Simple machines make work easier by multiplying force or changing its direction. Mechanical Advantage (MA) is the ratio of load to effort. Velocity Ratio (VR) is the ratio of distance moved by effort to distance moved by load. Efficiency = (MA/VR) x 100%. Levers are classified into three classes based on the positions of fulcrum, load, and effort. Single fixed pulleys have VR = 1 and change direction only. Single movable pulleys have VR = 2. In inclined planes, VR = length/height. The screw and wedge are modifications of the inclined plane.",

This is because the more pulleys there are, the more the effort is multiplied, resulting in a higher VR.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect order would be: single fixed pulley, block and tackle with 4 pulleys, single movable pulley, and block and tackle with 6 pulleys. This is wrong because a single movable pulley has a higher VR (2) than a block and tackle with 4 pulleys (VR = 4), and a block and tackle with 6 pulleys has the highest VR (6)."

      "explanation_correct": "The efficiency of a simple machine is determined by the ratio of its mechanical advantage (MA) to its velocity ratio (VR). Since the question specifies the same VR, the machines with lower MA will have higher efficiency, as the MA/VR ratio will be closer to 1. Therefore, the order of increasing efficiency is MA = 2, MA = 3, MA = 4, MA = 5.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect explanation would be to arrange the machines in order of increasing MA. However, this does not consider the efficiency of the machines, which is determined by the ratio of MA to VR. The correct order is based on the efficiency, not just the MA value."
