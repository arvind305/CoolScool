      "explanation_correct": "The formula Q = m x c x delta T is correct because it shows that the total heat (Q) transferred depends on the mass (m) of the substance, the specific heat capacity (c), and the change in temperature (delta T). The change in temperature, delta T, is the difference between the final and initial temperatures of the substance.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 'delta T', which represents the change in temperature of the substance. The formula Q = m x c x delta T is correct because it shows that the total heat (Q) transferred depends on the mass (m), specific heat capacity (c), and the change in temperature (delta T), not just the initial or final temperature alone."

      "correct_answer": "Lf",
      "explanation_correct": "The heat required for melting a material is given by the formula Q = m x Lf, where 'Lf' is the specific latent heat of fusion. This formula tells us that the heat needed to melt a certain mass of the material is directly proportional to the specific latent heat of fusion of that material.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'Lf', which stands for the specific latent heat of fusion. This is the amount of heat required per unit mass to change a solid material into a liquid at its melting point, without changing the temperature. The formula for heat required for melting is Q = m x Lf, not Q = m x c (where 'c' is the specific heat capacity)."

      "explanation_correct": "One calorie is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1 degree Celsius. This is equivalent to 4.186 Joules, which is the standard unit of energy. So 1 calorie equals 4.186 Joules.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be to say that 1 calorie equals 1 Joule. This is not correct because the calorie and Joule are different units of energy, with 1 calorie being equivalent to 4.186 Joules. The correct answer, 4.186, is the conversion factor between calories and Joules."

      "explanation_correct": "A calorimeter is used to measure heat in experiments because it is specifically designed to measure the amount of heat absorbed or released during a chemical or physical process. It helps us quantify the heat transfer between a hot and a cold body to understand the principles of heat and temperature.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format for this question is 'calorimeter'. A calorimeter is an insulated container used to measure the amount of heat absorbed or released during a process. It allows us to accurately track the change in temperature and calculate the heat transfer, which is crucial for understanding the principles of heat and calorimetry."

      "correct_answer": "latent",
      "explanation_correct": "Steam at 100 degrees C causes worse burns than water at 100 degrees C because steam releases latent heat. Latent heat is the heat absorbed or released during a phase change (from liquid to gas, in this case) without a change in temperature. This extra latent heat is what makes steam more dangerous than water at the same temperature.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is 'latent'. The reason steam causes worse burns than water at the same temperature is that steam releases latent heat, which is the extra heat absorbed or released during a phase change. This latent heat is not required to raise the temperature, but is still released and can cause more severe burns compared to just the sensible heat in water at the same temperature."

      "correct_answer": "boiling",
      "explanation_correct": "The flat portions of a heating curve represent the melting and boiling points of a substance. This is because during a phase change, the temperature remains constant even as heat is added, as the added heat is used to overcome the intermolecular forces and change the state of the material.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is 'boiling'. The flat portions of a heating curve represent the melting and boiling points of a substance. The melting point is where the material transitions from a solid to a liquid, while the boiling point is where the material transitions from a liquid to a gas. Therefore, the flat portion after the melting point represents the boiling of the material."
