    "text": "Light travels in straight lines and has dual nature (wave and particle). The laws of reflection state that angle of incidence equals angle of reflection, with incident ray, reflected ray, and normal in the same plane. For spherical mirrors, the mirror formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. Refraction occurs when light changes speed at medium boundaries. Snell's law states n1 sin(i) = n2 sin(r). Total internal reflection occurs when light travels from denser to rarer medium at angles greater than critical angle. For lenses, the formula is 1/f = 1/v - 1/u, and power P = 1/f in diopters.",

      "explanation_correct": "The described phenomenon — light travelling from a denser medium (glass) to a rarer medium (air), at an angle exceeding the critical angle (approximately 42 degrees for glass), and being completely reflected back — is total internal reflection (TIR). TIR requires two conditions: light must travel from a denser to a rarer medium, and the angle of incidence must exceed the critical angle. Both conditions are met in this description.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A (regular reflection) is incorrect because regular reflection occurs when light bounces off a surface like a mirror, not when it fails to cross a boundary between two media. Option B (refraction) is incorrect because refraction involves bending of light as it passes from one medium to another, but in TIR the light does not pass through at all. Option D (diffuse reflection) occurs at rough surfaces and involves scattering, which is different from what is described."

Beyond the critical angle, Snell's law gives sin(r) > 1, which is physically impossible — no refracted ray can exist. Therefore, all the light is reflected back into the denser medium.

      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because the reflected rays actually diverge in this case — they do not converge in front of the mirror. If they converged, the image would be real, not virtual. Option C is incorrect because absorption of light does not cause magnification — magnification is a geometric property of how reflected rays form an image. Option D is incorrect because the mirror reflects light perfectly well at all distances; the virtual image formation is a well-defined optical phenomenon, not a malfunction."
