    "text": "Light travels in straight lines and has dual nature (wave and particle). The laws of reflection state that angle of incidence equals angle of reflection, with incident ray, reflected ray, and normal in the same plane. For spherical mirrors, the mirror formula is 1/f = 1/v + 1/u. Refraction occurs when light changes speed at medium boundaries. Snell's law states n1 sin(i) = n2 sin(r). Total internal reflection occurs when light travels from denser to rarer medium at angles greater than critical angle. For lenses, the formula is 1/f = 1/v - 1/u, and power P = 1/f in diopters.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format is a single number, and the correct answer is 2. The radius of curvature (R) of a spherical mirror is not equal to the focal length (f) directly. Instead, the relationship between them is R = 2f, meaning the radius of curvature is twice the focal length. This is an important concept to understand for spherical mirrors."

      "explanation_correct": "Optical fibers work on the principle of total internal reflection. When light travels from a denser medium (the core of the optical fiber) to a rarer medium (the cladding around the core), it undergoes total internal reflection if the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle. This allows the light to be transmitted through the fiber with minimal loss.",

When light travels from a denser medium to a rarer medium, it can undergo total internal reflection if the angle of incidence is greater than the critical angle. This is the key principle behind the working of optical fibers, which transmit light signals with minimal loss."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be a positive focal length. This is because a diverging lens is thinner in the middle than at the edges, which causes light rays to spread out rather than converge. The correct answer is a 'negative' focal length, which indicates that the lens is diverging or spreading out the light rays."
