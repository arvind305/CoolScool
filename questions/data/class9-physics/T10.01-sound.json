    "text": "Sound is a longitudinal mechanical wave that requires a medium to travel. It is characterized by frequency (f), wavelength (lambda), and velocity (v), related by v = f x lambda. Speed of sound is fastest in solids, slower in liquids, and slowest in gases. Speed in air at 20 degrees C is about 340 m/s. Echo is a reflected sound heard separately, requiring minimum 17.2 m distance in air. Ultrasound (>20000 Hz) has applications in SONAR and medical imaging. Infrasound (<20 Hz) is below human hearing range. Human hearing range is 20 Hz to 20000 Hz.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Sound is a longitudinal wave because the vibrations in the medium (e.g. air, water) move back and forth in the same direction as the wave is travelling. This is different from a transverse wave where the vibrations are perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Sound is not a transverse wave because in a transverse wave, the vibrations are perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. Sound waves in air, for example, involve the back and forth motion of air molecules in the same direction as the wave is travelling, which is a characteristic of longitudinal waves. Sound is also not an electromagnetic wave since it requires a medium to travel, unlike electromagnetic waves which can travel through a vacuum."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The accepted answer format for this fill-in-the-blank question is 'infrasound'. Sound with frequency below 20 Hz is called infrasound, not 'low-frequency sound' or 'subsonic sound'. Infrasound is below the human hearing range, which is 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz."

      "explanation_correct": "The SI unit of frequency is Hertz (Hz). This is because frequency measures the number of waves that pass a point in a given amount of time, and Hertz is the standard unit that represents the number of cycles per second.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is Hertz (Hz). Frequency is a measure of how many waves pass a point in a certain amount of time, and the SI unit for this is Hertz. Other units like seconds (s) or kilohertz (kHz) can also be used, but the standard unit is Hertz."

This is because sound waves travel faster through the more densely packed particles in solids compared to the more loosely packed particles in liquids and gases. So, the order from fastest to slowest is Steel (solid), Water (liquid), and Air (gas).",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The order from fastest to slowest speed of sound is not Air, Water, Steel. This is because sound travels faster in solids like steel compared to liquids like water, and slowest in gases like air. The correct order is Steel, Water, Air, as steel has the highest density and air has the lowest density of these three media."
