    "text": "Sound is a longitudinal mechanical wave that requires a medium to travel. It is characterized by frequency (f), wavelength (lambda), and velocity (v), related by v = f x lambda. Speed of sound is fastest in solids, slower in liquids, and slowest in gases. Speed in air at 20 degrees C is about 340 m/s. Echo is a reflected sound heard separately, requiring minimum 17.2 m distance in air. Ultrasound (>20000 Hz) has applications in SONAR and medical imaging. Infrasound (<20 Hz) is below human hearing range. Human hearing range is 20 Hz to 20000 Hz.",

      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation_correct": "Sound is a longitudinal wave because the vibrations in the medium (e.g. air, water) move back and forth in the same direction as the wave is travelling. This is different from a transverse wave where the vibrations are perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Sound is not a transverse wave because in a transverse wave, the vibrations are perpendicular to the direction of wave propagation. Sound waves in air, for example, involve the back and forth motion of air molecules in the same direction as the wave is travelling, which is a characteristic of longitudinal waves. Sound is also not an electromagnetic wave since it requires a medium to travel, unlike electromagnetic waves which can travel through a vacuum."

      "explanation_correct": "When Riya presses the vibrating tuning fork against the table, the fork forces the table to vibrate at the same frequency. Since the table has a much larger surface area than the prongs of the fork, it sets a much larger volume of air into vibration. Additionally, solids transmit vibrations efficiently due to their closely packed particles. Both these factors combine to make the sound louder.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because the table does not change the frequency of the tuning fork — it vibrates at the same frequency. Option C is incorrect because the table does not absorb and re-emit sound at higher intensity; rather, it acts as a sounding board. Option D is incorrect because the speed of sound being lower in the table is not the reason for amplification — the key factor is the larger vibrating surface area."

Since the echo is heard after 1 second, the speed of sound = total distance / time = 360 m / 1 s = 360 m/s. This value is close to the standard speed of sound in air (approximately 340 m/s at 20 degrees C), with the slight difference due to temperature conditions.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A (180 m/s) incorrectly uses only the one-way distance without accounting for the return trip. Option C (90 m/s) divides the one-way distance by 2 again, which is wrong. Option D (720 m/s) doubles the correct answer without justification.

Both strings are plucked with the same force, so the amplitude (and hence loudness) is similar, but the frequency differs due to the difference in thickness.",

Option C is incorrect because the speed of sound in air does not change based on which string is plucked — it depends on the medium's properties.

Dogs, however, can hear frequencies up to about 65000 Hz, so 25000 Hz falls well within their hearing range, allowing the dog to respond to the whistle.",

Option C is incorrect because distance is not the issue — Arjun is standing close by but still cannot hear it due to the frequency being beyond human hearing.

This is because water vapour molecules (H2O, molecular mass 18) are lighter than nitrogen (N2, molecular mass 28) and oxygen (O2, molecular mass 32) molecules that they replace. The lower average molecular mass of humid air allows sound to travel slightly faster.",
