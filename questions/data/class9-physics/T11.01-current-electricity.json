      "explanation_correct": "The equivalent resistance of two resistors in parallel is smaller than the individual resistor values, so 1.33 ohms is the smallest. The individual resistor values of 2 ohms and 4 ohms come next, and the equivalent resistance of the two resistors in series is the largest at 6 ohms.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect ordering would be to put the 2 ohm and 4 ohm resistors in order from smallest to largest, and then put the series and parallel combinations after them. This is wrong because the parallel combination of 2 ohms and 4 ohms has a lower equivalent resistance than the individual resistors."

This is because the current is inversely proportional to the resistance, so a higher resistance would have a lower current. However, the correct order places the resistors in increasing order of resistance, which corresponds to decreasing order of current for a constant voltage."
