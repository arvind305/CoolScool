    "text": "A magnetic field is a region where magnetic forces act. Magnetic field lines show the direction and strength of the field. Current-carrying conductors produce magnetic fields (Oersted's experiment). The right-hand thumb rule gives the field direction around a straight conductor. Electromagnets are temporary magnets made by passing current through a coil around a soft iron core. A current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field experiences a force (Fleming's left-hand rule). The DC motor converts electrical energy to mechanical energy using this principle.",

This is because the force experienced by the current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field is given by the formula F = BILsin(θ), where θ is the angle between the conductor and the magnetic field. When θ is 90 degrees, sin(θ) becomes 1, giving the maximum possible force."

So, the order of increasing force is 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 90 degrees.",

It is maximum when the angle is 0 degrees, and decreases as the angle increases. The order of increasing force is 0 degrees, 30 degrees, 45 degrees, 90 degrees, not 90 degrees, 45 degrees, 30 degrees, 0 degrees."

      "explanation_correct": "The magnetic field is most uniform around a solenoid, followed by a circular loop, and least uniform around a single straight wire. This is because the magnetic field lines are more concentrated and parallel inside a solenoid, while they radiate outwards from a single wire.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The magnetic field is not most uniform around a single straight wire. This is because the magnetic field lines around a single wire spread out and are not concentrated, making the field less uniform. A circular loop has a more concentrated field, and a solenoid has the most uniform field since the magnetic field lines are parallel and concentrated inside the coil."

The center of the magnet has the weakest field, as the lines of force spread out evenly in all directions. The region midway between the center and the pole has a stronger field than the center, but weaker than the pole."
