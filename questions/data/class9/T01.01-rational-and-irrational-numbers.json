They include all integers, fractions, and decimals that either terminate or have a repeating pattern.

Together, rational and irrational numbers form the real number system. Examples of rational numbers include 3/4, -5, 0.75, 0.333... (1/3). Examples of irrational numbers include √2, π, e, and √3.",

This is not correct because when you divide a square root by the same square root, the result is always a rational number, in this case 1. Rational numbers can be expressed as a ratio of two integers, and 1 is a rational number."
