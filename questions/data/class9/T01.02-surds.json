    "text": "A surd is an irrational root of a rational number that cannot be simplified to remove the root symbol. For example, √2, √3, and ∛5 are surds, but √4 = 2 is not a surd. The simplest form of a surd has the smallest possible number under the radical sign with no perfect power factors. Operations on surds follow specific rules: like surds can be added or subtracted by combining coefficients, surds are multiplied by multiplying coefficients and radicands separately, and division requires rationalizing the denominator by multiplying by a conjugate or appropriate form to eliminate radicals from the denominator.",
