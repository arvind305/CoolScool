    "text": "Profit, Loss and Discount involves understanding commercial mathematics concepts. Cost Price (CP) is the price at which an article is purchased. Selling Price (SP) is the price at which it is sold. Profit = SP - CP when SP > CP, and Loss = CP - SP when CP > SP. Marked Price (MP) is the price listed on an article. Discount is the reduction on marked price. SP = MP - Discount. Successive discounts are multiple discounts applied one after another. Overhead expenses are additional costs that add to the cost price.",

      "Loss % = (Loss / CP) × 100",
      "SP = CP + Profit or SP = CP - Loss",
      "Discount = MP - SP",
      "Discount % = (Discount / MP) × 100",

      "question_text": "What is the single equivalent discount for two successive discounts of 10% and 20%?",
      "explanation_correct": "The single equivalent discount for two successive discounts of 10% and 20% is 28%. This is because the first discount of 10% means the selling price is 90% of the marked price, and the second discount of 20% means the selling price is 80% of the remaining 90%, which is 72% of the original marked price. Therefore, the single equivalent discount is 28%.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The single equivalent discount for two successive discounts of 10% and 20% is not 30%, 25%, or 32%. This is because the correct way to calculate the single equivalent discount is to first apply the 10% discount, and then apply the 20% discount on the remaining 90% of the marked price. The final result is 72% of the original marked price, which corresponds to a single discount of 28%."

      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is incorrect because the transportation charges of Rs. 500 need to be added to the cost price of Rs. 5000 to get the actual cost price. Option C is incorrect because the transportation charges cannot be subtracted from the cost price. Option D is incorrect because it is not the actual cost price, but a combination of the cost price and the transportation charges."

      "explanation_correct": "If the marked price is Rs. 800 and the discount is 15%, the selling price would be Rs. 680. This is because the discount of 15% on the marked price of Rs. 800 is Rs. 120, and the selling price is the marked price minus the discount, which is Rs. 800 - Rs. 120 = Rs. 680.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "Option A is the correct answer. To find the selling price, we need to calculate the discount first. The discount is 15% of the marked price, which is 0.15 x Rs. 800 = Rs. 120. Subtracting the discount from the marked price gives us the selling price, which is Rs. 800 - Rs. 120 = Rs. 680."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement that two successive discounts of 10% each is equivalent to a single discount of 20% is false. This is because when discounts are applied successively, the second discount is applied on the amount remaining after the first discount. So, the final discount is less than 20%."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect options are not correct because they do not account for the two successive discounts of 20% and 10%. Option A) Rs. 1400 is too low, as the 20% and 10% discounts applied to the marked price of Rs. 2000 would not result in a final selling price of Rs. 1400. Option C) Rs. 1600 is the price after the first 20% discount, but it does not consider the second 10% discount. Option D) Rs. 1380 is also incorrect, as the final selling price should be higher than this amount."

The discount percentage is calculated by finding the difference between the marked price and the selling price, and then dividing it by the marked price and multiplying by 100.
