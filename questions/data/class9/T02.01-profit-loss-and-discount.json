    "text": "Profit, Loss and Discount involves understanding commercial mathematics concepts. Cost Price (CP) is the price at which an article is purchased. Selling Price (SP) is the price at which it is sold. Profit = SP - CP when SP > CP, and Loss = CP - SP when CP > SP. Marked Price (MP) is the price listed on an article. Discount is the reduction on marked price. SP = MP - Discount. Successive discounts are multiple discounts applied one after another. Overhead expenses are additional costs that add to the cost price.",
    "rules": [
      "Profit % = (Profit / CP) × 100",
      "Loss % = (Loss / CP) × 100",
      "SP = CP + Profit or SP = CP - Loss",
      "Discount = MP - SP",
      "Discount % = (Discount / MP) × 100",
      "For successive discounts d1% and d2%, net discount % = d1 + d2 - (d1 × d2)/100",
      "Actual CP = Purchase Price + Overhead Expenses",
      "Net Price = Marked Price - Total Discount"
