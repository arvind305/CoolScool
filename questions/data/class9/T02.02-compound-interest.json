    "text": "Compound Interest is the interest calculated on both the principal amount and the accumulated interest from previous periods. Unlike simple interest where interest is calculated only on the principal, compound interest grows exponentially as the interest earned in each period is added to the principal for calculating interest in the next period. The compound interest formula is A = P(1 + r/100)^n, where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the rate of interest per annum, and n is the time period. For different compounding frequencies, the formula is modified: for half-yearly compounding use A = P(1 + r/200)^(2n), and for quarterly compounding use A = P(1 + r/400)^(4n). The compound interest (CI) is calculated as CI = A - P.",
    "rules": [
      "Compound interest is always greater than or equal to simple interest for the same principal, rate, and time period",
      "The difference between CI and SI increases as the time period increases",
      "For yearly compounding: A = P(1 + r/100)^n",
      "For half-yearly compounding: A = P(1 + r/200)^(2n), where n is in years",
      "For quarterly compounding: A = P(1 + r/400)^(4n), where n is in years",
      "Compound Interest = Amount - Principal",
      "When compounding frequency increases, the compound interest increases",
      "For inverse problems, substitute known values and solve for the unknown variable"

      "explanation_correct": "The correct answer is B) Rs 1100. After the first year, the amount would be the principal of Rs 1000 plus the interest earned at 10% per annum, which is Rs 100. Therefore, the amount after the first year is Rs 1000 + Rs 100 = Rs 1100.",

This is the essence of compound interest - the interest earned in each period is added to the principal, so that the next period's interest is calculated on a larger amount.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The interest earned in the first year is not added to the interest, but to the principal amount. The principal is the starting amount on which interest is calculated in the first year. For the second year, the principal becomes the original principal plus the interest earned in the first year, and the interest is calculated on this new, higher principal."

This is because the interest is calculated on the total amount (principal + previous interest), which keeps increasing.

This is because the formula for compound interest is A = P(1 + r/100)^n, where A is the final amount, P is the principal, r is the rate of interest, and n is the time period.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answers are not correct because they do not represent the principal amount after three years of compound interest at 10% per annum. Option A) Rs 1331 is the final amount after three years, not the principal. Option C) Rs 1100 is the initial principal amount, not the principal after three years. Option D) Rs 1000 is also the initial principal amount, not the principal after three years. The correct answer is B) Rs 1210, which is the principal amount after two years of compound interest at 10% per annum."
