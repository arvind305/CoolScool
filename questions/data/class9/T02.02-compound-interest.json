  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Compound Interest is the interest calculated on both the principal amount and the accumulated interest from previous periods. Unlike simple interest where interest is calculated only on the principal, compound interest grows exponentially as the interest earned in each period is added to the principal for calculating interest in the next period. The compound interest formula is A = P(1 + r/100)^n, where A is the amount, P is the principal, r is the rate of interest per annum, and n is the time period. For different compounding frequencies, the formula is modified: for half-yearly compounding use A = P(1 + r/200)^(2n), and for quarterly compounding use A = P(1 + r/400)^(4n). The compound interest (CI) is calculated as CI = A - P.",
    "rules": [
      "Compound interest is always greater than or equal to simple interest for the same principal, rate, and time period",
      "The difference between CI and SI increases as the time period increases",
      "For yearly compounding: A = P(1 + r/100)^n",
      "For half-yearly compounding: A = P(1 + r/200)^(2n), where n is in years",
      "For quarterly compounding: A = P(1 + r/400)^(4n), where n is in years",
      "Compound Interest = Amount - Principal",
      "When compounding frequency increases, the compound interest increases",
      "For inverse problems, substitute known values and solve for the unknown variable"
