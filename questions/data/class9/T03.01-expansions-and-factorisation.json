    "text": "Expansions and Factorisation form the foundation of algebra. Expansion involves using algebraic identities to expand expressions like (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2. Factorisation is the reverse process - breaking down expressions into products of simpler factors. Key identities include: (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, (a-b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2, a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b), (a+b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3, (a-b)^3 = a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3, and (a+b+c)^2 = a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2bc + 2ca. Factorisation techniques include taking out common factors, grouping terms, and applying identities.",
    "rules": [
      "Always identify the appropriate algebraic identity before expanding",
      "For (a+b)^2, remember the middle term is 2ab, not ab",
      "The identity a^2 - b^2 = (a+b)(a-b) only works for difference of squares",
      "When factorising, first look for common factors",
      "For factorisation by grouping, arrange terms to create common factors",
      "The expansion of (a+b+c)^2 includes all squared terms plus all pair products doubled",
      "For cubic identities, remember the coefficients follow patterns: 1, 3, 3, 1",
      "Always verify factorisation by expanding back to the original expression"
