    "text": "Changing the subject of a formula means rearranging an equation to make a different variable the subject (isolated on one side). This process requires applying inverse operations in the reverse order of BODMAS/PEMDAS, treating all other variables as constants. When the subject appears multiple times or is inside squares, square roots, or fractions, additional algebraic techniques such as factorization or squaring both sides may be needed.",
    "rules": [
      "Identify the variable to be made the subject",
      "Apply inverse operations to both sides of the equation systematically",
      "Work in reverse BODMAS order: addition/subtraction first, then multiplication/division, then powers/roots",
      "When the subject appears in multiple terms, collect all terms containing it on one side",
      "Factor out the subject variable if it appears in multiple terms",
      "For square roots: square both sides of the equation",
      "For squares: take the square root of both sides (consider both positive and negative roots when appropriate)",
      "For fractions: multiply both sides by the denominator to clear fractions",
