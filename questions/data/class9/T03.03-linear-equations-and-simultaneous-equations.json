    "text": "Linear equations are algebraic equations where the highest power of the variable is 1. A linear equation in one variable has the form ax + b = 0, while a linear equation in two variables has the form ax + by + c = 0. Simultaneous equations are a set of two or more equations that must be satisfied at the same time. The two main methods for solving simultaneous linear equations are the elimination method (adding or subtracting equations to eliminate one variable) and the substitution method (expressing one variable in terms of another and substituting). These concepts are fundamental for solving real-world problems involving multiple unknown quantities.",

      "In a linear equation, variables have a power of 1 only",
      "The solution of simultaneous equations is the point where the two lines intersect",
