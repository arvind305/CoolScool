    "text": "The graphical method of solving simultaneous linear equations involves plotting both equations on the same Cartesian plane and finding their point of intersection. Each linear equation represents a straight line, and the coordinates of the point where these lines intersect give the solution to the system of equations. This solution satisfies both equations simultaneously. There are three possible cases: (1) The lines intersect at exactly one point - unique solution, (2) The lines are parallel - no solution, and (3) The lines are coincident (overlap completely) - infinitely many solutions. The graphical solution can always be verified algebraically using substitution or elimination methods.",
