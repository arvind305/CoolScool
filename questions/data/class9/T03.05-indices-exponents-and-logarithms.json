    "text": "Indices, exponents and logarithms are fundamental concepts in algebra. An index or exponent indicates how many times a base number is multiplied by itself. The laws of indices help simplify expressions involving powers. Logarithms are the inverse of exponents - if a^x = b, then log_a(b) = x. The common logarithm uses base 10. Understanding these concepts is essential for solving exponential equations and working with large or small numbers in scientific notation.",
