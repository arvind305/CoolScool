    "text": "Two triangles are congruent if they have the same shape and size. This means all corresponding sides and angles are equal. The criteria for congruence are: SSS (Side-Side-Side), SAS (Side-Angle-Side), ASA (Angle-Side-Angle), AAS (Angle-Angle-Side), and RHS (Right angle-Hypotenuse-Side). Congruent triangles can be used to prove various properties about medians (lines from vertices to midpoints of opposite sides), altitudes (perpendiculars from vertices to opposite sides), and angle bisectors. The medians of a triangle meet at the centroid, altitudes meet at the orthocentre, and angle bisectors meet at the incentre.",
