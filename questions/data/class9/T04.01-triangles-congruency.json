    "text": "Two triangles are congruent if they have the same shape and size. This means all corresponding sides and angles are equal. The criteria for congruence are: SSS (Side-Side-Side), SAS (Side-Angle-Side), ASA (Angle-Side-Angle), AAS (Angle-Angle-Side), and RHS (Right angle-Hypotenuse-Side). Congruent triangles can be used to prove various properties about medians (lines from vertices to midpoints of opposite sides), altitudes (perpendiculars from vertices to opposite sides), and angle bisectors. The medians of a triangle meet at the centroid, altitudes meet at the orthocentre, and angle bisectors meet at the incentre.",
    "rules": [
      "Two triangles are congruent if and only if their corresponding sides and angles are equal",
      "SSS: If three sides of one triangle are equal to three sides of another triangle, the triangles are congruent",
      "SAS: If two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to two sides and the included angle of another triangle, the triangles are congruent",
      "ASA: If two angles and the included side of one triangle are equal to two angles and the included side of another triangle, the triangles are congruent",
      "AAS: If two angles and a non-included side of one triangle are equal to two angles and the corresponding non-included side of another triangle, the triangles are congruent",
      "RHS: If the hypotenuse and one side of a right-angled triangle are equal to the hypotenuse and one side of another right-angled triangle, the triangles are congruent",
      "The three medians of a triangle are concurrent at the centroid, which divides each median in the ratio 2:1",
      "The three altitudes of a triangle are concurrent at the orthocentre",
      "The three angle bisectors of a triangle are concurrent at the incentre, which is equidistant from all three sides"
