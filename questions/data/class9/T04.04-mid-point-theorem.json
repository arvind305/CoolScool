    "text": "The Mid-point Theorem states that the line segment joining the mid-points of two sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side and equal to half its length. If D and E are mid-points of sides AB and AC of triangle ABC respectively, then DE || BC and DE = (1/2)BC. The converse states that if a line through the mid-point of one side is parallel to another side, it bisects the third side. The Equal Intercept Theorem states that three or more parallel lines make equal intercepts on any transversal if they make equal intercepts on one transversal.",
