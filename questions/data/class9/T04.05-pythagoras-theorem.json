    "text": "The Pythagoras theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. If a and b are the lengths of the two shorter sides and c is the length of the hypotenuse, then a² + b² = c². The converse states that if a² + b² = c² for a triangle with sides a, b, and c, then the triangle is right-angled. Pythagorean triplets are sets of three positive integers that satisfy this relationship, such as (3, 4, 5), (5, 12, 13), and (8, 15, 17).",

      "In a right-angled triangle: (perpendicular)² + (base)² = (hypotenuse)²",
