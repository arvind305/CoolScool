    "text": "Similarity in geometry refers to figures that have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. Two triangles are similar if their corresponding angles are equal and their corresponding sides are proportional. The AA (Angle-Angle) criterion states that if two angles of one triangle are equal to two angles of another triangle, the triangles are similar. The Basic Proportionality Theorem (Thales' theorem) states that if a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle, it divides the other two sides proportionally. These concepts are fundamental for solving problems involving proportions, scale factors, and geometric relationships.",
