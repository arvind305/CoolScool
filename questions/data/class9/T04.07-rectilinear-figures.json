(2) Parallelograms have opposite sides equal and parallel, opposite angles equal, and diagonals bisecting each other. (3) Special parallelograms include rectangles (all angles 90°), rhombuses (all sides equal), and squares (all sides equal and all angles 90°). (4) Trapeziums have one pair of parallel sides, and isosceles trapeziums have non-parallel sides equal. (5) Properties can be proved using triangle congruence criteria (SSS, SAS, ASA, RHS).",

      "explanation_correct": "In an isosceles trapezium, the two non-parallel sides (AD and BC) are equal in length. Since AD = BC = 5 cm, the height of the trapezium is the perpendicular distance between the parallel sides AB and DC. This can be calculated using the formula for the area of a trapezium: Area = 1/2 × (sum of parallel sides) × height. Substituting the given values, we get height = 2 × Area / (AB + DC) = 2 × (14 × 8) / (14 + 8) = 4 cm.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect options do not correctly calculate the height of the isosceles trapezium. The height is the perpendicular distance between the parallel sides, which can be found using the formula for the area of a trapezium. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they do not properly apply this formula and calculation."

This is because if two pairs of opposite sides are parallel, then the other two sides must also be parallel, making the quadrilateral a parallelogram.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement is not correct because to prove that a quadrilateral is a parallelogram, it is not enough to show that just one pair of opposite sides is equal and parallel.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The statement is not correct. Even though the diagonals of a parallelogram are perpendicular and equal, it does not necessarily mean that the parallelogram is a square. A rhombus, which is a special type of parallelogram, also has perpendicular and equal diagonals, but its sides are not all equal.

In a general trapezium, the line segment joining the midpoints of the non-parallel sides is not necessarily parallel to the parallel sides, and its length may not be half the sum of the parallel sides.
