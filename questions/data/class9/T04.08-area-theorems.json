This is because parallelograms with the same base and between the same parallel lines have equal areas.",

This is because the area theorem states that parallelograms on the same base and between the same parallel lines have equal areas. The area of a parallelogram depends on its base and height, and since both parallelograms have the same base and are between the same parallel lines, their areas must be equal."

The area of each triangle is therefore half the area of the parallelogram.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The answer should be 'parallel lines'. This is because parallelograms on the same base and between the same parallel lines have equal areas. The parallel lines act as the boundaries that contain the parallelograms, ensuring they have the same height and thus the same area.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The question asks for the area of a triangle on the same base and between the same parallel lines as a parallelogram with an area of 48 cm².

This is because the area of a triangle is determined by its base and the perpendicular distance between the base and the opposite vertex (height), so if the base and the parallel lines are the same, the areas of the triangles will be equal.",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The correct answer is that the two triangles must lie on the same base and between the same parallel lines to have equal areas. This is because the area of a triangle is calculated as half the product of the base and the height, and if the base and parallel lines are the same, the heights will also be the same, resulting in equal areas. Triangles that do not satisfy this condition may have different areas, even if they share the same base or are between the same parallel lines."

The key is to first consider the two parallelograms, identify that they share the same base and are between the same parallel lines, and then conclude that they have the same height.

      "explanation_correct": "The area of triangle PQT is half the area of parallelogram PQRS since they are on the same base PQ and have the same height (half the height of the parallelogram). Therefore, if the area of parallelogram PQRS is 96 cm², the area of triangle PQT would be half of that, which is 24 cm².",
      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect answer would be 48 cm². This is because some students might think that since the triangle has the same base as the parallelogram, its area would be the same. However, the theorem states that the area of a triangle is half the area of a parallelogram on the same base and between the same parallel lines. So, the correct area of the triangle PQT is 24 cm²."
