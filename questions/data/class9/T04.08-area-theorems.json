    "text": "Area theorems establish fundamental relationships between areas of geometric figures. Key theorems include: (1) Parallelograms on the same base and between the same parallel lines have equal areas; (2) The area of a triangle is half the area of a parallelogram on the same base and between the same parallel lines; (3) Triangles on the same base and between the same parallel lines have equal areas. These theorems are essential for solving complex geometric problems involving area calculations and proofs.",

      "The distance between parallel lines represents the height of the figure",
      "Congruent figures have equal areas, but figures with equal areas need not be congruent"
