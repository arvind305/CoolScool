    "text": "A circle is the locus of points equidistant from a fixed point called the centre. Key circle properties include: (1) A perpendicular from the centre to a chord bisects the chord, and conversely, the line joining the centre to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to it. (2) Equal chords are equidistant from the centre, and chords equidistant from the centre are equal. (3) The angle subtended by an arc at the centre is twice the angle subtended at any point on the remaining part of the circle. (4) Angles in the same segment are equal, and the angle in a semicircle is a right angle. (5) In a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles are supplementary (sum to 180°), and an exterior angle equals the interior opposite angle.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The radius of a circle is not the longest chord. A chord is a line segment that connects two points on the circle, while the radius is the line segment from the center to the circle.

The region between a chord and the arc it subtends is not called a 'sector' - that refers to the region between two radii and the arc they intercept.

      "explanation_incorrect": "The angle in a semicircle is not always 90°. This is a common misconception. The angle in a semicircle is formed by two radii of the circle, and it is always a right angle (90°) because the radii meet at the circumference of the circle at a perpendicular angle.

This is because the angle subtended by an arc at the centre of a circle is twice the angle subtended by the same arc at any point on the circumference.
