    "text": "A circle is the locus of points equidistant from a fixed point called the centre. Key circle properties include: (1) A perpendicular from the centre to a chord bisects the chord, and conversely, the line joining the centre to the midpoint of a chord is perpendicular to it. (2) Equal chords are equidistant from the centre, and chords equidistant from the centre are equal. (3) The angle subtended by an arc at the centre is twice the angle subtended at any point on the remaining part of the circle. (4) Angles in the same segment are equal, and the angle in a semicircle is a right angle. (5) In a cyclic quadrilateral, opposite angles are supplementary (sum to 180°), and an exterior angle equals the interior opposite angle.",
