    "text": "Geometric constructions involve creating precise figures using only a ruler (straightedge) and compass. Triangle constructions require specific measurements: SSS (three sides), SAS (two sides and included angle), ASA (two angles and included side), and RHS (right angle, hypotenuse, and one side). Quadrilateral constructions build on triangle methods by dividing the shape into triangles. Special constructions include angle bisectors, perpendicular bisectors, and standard angles. These techniques form the foundation of classical Euclidean geometry.",
