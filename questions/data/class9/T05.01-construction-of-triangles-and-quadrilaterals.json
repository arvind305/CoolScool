    "text": "Geometric constructions involve creating precise figures using only a ruler (straightedge) and compass. Triangle constructions require specific measurements: SSS (three sides), SAS (two sides and included angle), ASA (two angles and included side), and RHS (right angle, hypotenuse, and one side). Quadrilateral constructions build on triangle methods by dividing the shape into triangles. Special constructions include angle bisectors, perpendicular bisectors, and standard angles. These techniques form the foundation of classical Euclidean geometry.",
    "rules": [
      "SSS construction requires three side lengths that satisfy the triangle inequality theorem",
      "SAS construction uses two sides and the angle between them",
      "ASA construction uses two angles and the side between them",
      "RHS construction is specific to right triangles with hypotenuse and one side",
      "Quadrilaterals can be constructed by dividing them into triangles using a diagonal",
      "Angle bisector divides an angle into two equal parts",
      "Perpendicular bisector passes through the midpoint at 90 degrees",
      "Standard angles can be constructed: 60° (equilateral triangle), 90° (perpendicular), 120° (supplement of 60°), 30° (bisect 60°), 45° (bisect 90°)"
