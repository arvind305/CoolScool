    "text": "Data collection and organisation is fundamental to statistics. Data can be collected directly (primary data) or from existing sources (secondary data). Once collected, data is organised using frequency distribution tables. For ungrouped data, each distinct value is listed with its frequency. For grouped data, values are arranged in class intervals with their frequencies, using concepts like class marks (midpoint of interval) and class boundaries (exact limits separating classes).",
    "rules": [
      "Primary data is collected firsthand through surveys, observations, or experiments",
      "Secondary data is obtained from existing sources like books, records, or websites",
      "Frequency distribution shows how often each value or range of values occurs",
      "Class interval = Upper limit - Lower limit",
      "Class mark = (Upper limit + Lower limit) / 2",
      "Class boundaries eliminate gaps between consecutive classes",
      "Lower boundary = Lower limit - 0.5, Upper boundary = Upper limit + 0.5",
      "Class size should be uniform in grouped frequency distribution"
