    "text": "Graphical representation is a visual method of displaying statistical data through charts and graphs. Bar graphs use rectangular bars to compare discrete data categories, with compound bar graphs showing multiple data sets side by side and component bar graphs stacking data within bars. Histograms represent continuous frequency distributions with adjacent bars, where bar width represents class intervals (which may be unequal) and bar height represents frequency or frequency density. Frequency polygons are line graphs formed by connecting midpoints of histogram bars or plotting class midpoints against frequencies, providing a smooth representation of frequency distribution.",
    "rules": [
      "In bar graphs, bars are separated by gaps; in histograms, bars are adjacent with no gaps",
      "For histograms with unequal class intervals, frequency density = frequency ÷ class width must be used for the vertical axis",
      "Frequency polygons are drawn by joining the midpoints of the tops of histogram bars with straight lines",
      "In compound bar graphs, bars for different categories are placed side by side for easy comparison",
      "In component (or stacked) bar graphs, different components are stacked vertically within a single bar",
      "The area of each bar in a histogram represents the frequency of that class interval",
      "Frequency polygons can be closed by extending to the midpoint of the next class interval on both ends"

      "explanation_incorrect": "A compound bar graph differs from a simple bar graph in that it shows multiple data sets side by side within each bar, rather than just a single data set. This allows you to compare the values of different categories directly. The other options are not correct - compound bar graphs can use either horizontal or vertical bars, they do use a scale, and they do not necessarily have gaps between the bars."
