    "text": "Measures of central tendency are statistical measures that identify a single value as representative of an entire distribution. The three main measures are mean (arithmetic average), median (middle value when data is arranged in order), and mode (most frequently occurring value). For ungrouped data, these can be calculated directly. For grouped data, we use class intervals and frequencies, applying specific formulas: mean uses direct method or assumed mean method, median uses cumulative frequency and interpolation formula, and mode is determined by the modal class (class with highest frequency).",
    "rules": [
      "Mean of ungrouped data = Sum of observations ÷ Number of observations",
      "Mean of grouped data (direct method) = Σ(f × x) ÷ Σf, where f is frequency and x is class mark",
      "Mean of grouped data (assumed mean method) = A + [Σ(f × d) ÷ Σf], where A is assumed mean and d is deviation",
      "Median of ungrouped data: Arrange in order, find middle value (or average of two middle values for even count)",
      "Median of grouped data = L + [(n/2 - cf)/f] × h, where L is lower boundary of median class, n is total frequency, cf is cumulative frequency before median class, f is frequency of median class, h is class width",
      "Mode of ungrouped data is the value that appears most frequently",
      "Modal class of grouped data is the class interval with the highest frequency"
