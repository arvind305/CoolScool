In this case, the parallel sides are 25 m and 10 m, and the height is 14 m. Plugging these values into the formula gives us (1/2) × (25 m + 10 m) × 14 m = 210 m².",

Given the cost of fencing the field is Rs 5280 at Rs 24 per metre, we can calculate the circumference of the field as 5280/24 = 220 metres.
