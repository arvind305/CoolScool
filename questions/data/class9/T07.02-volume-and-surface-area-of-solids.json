  "topic_name": "Volume and Surface Area of Solids",
  "canonical_explanation": {
    "text": "Volume and Surface Area of Solids deals with calculating the space occupied by three-dimensional objects and the area of their surfaces. For cuboids: Volume = l × b × h, Total Surface Area = 2(lb + bh + hl). For cubes: Volume = a³, Total Surface Area = 6a². For cylinders: Volume = πr²h, Curved Surface Area = 2πrh, Total Surface Area = 2πr(r + h). Understanding these formulas and their applications is essential for solving real-world problems involving containers, construction, and design.",
    "rules": [
      "Always identify the shape (cuboid, cube, or cylinder) before selecting the formula",
      "Ensure all measurements are in the same units before calculation",
      "For cylinders, distinguish between curved surface area (CSA) and total surface area (TSA)",
      "Volume is measured in cubic units (cm³, m³) while surface area is in square units (cm², m²)",
      "When solving word problems, identify given dimensions and what needs to be calculated",
      "Use π = 22/7 or 3.14 as specified in the problem"
