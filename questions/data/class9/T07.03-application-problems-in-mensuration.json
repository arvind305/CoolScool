    "text": "Application problems in mensuration involve solving real-world problems using formulas for area, volume, and surface area of geometric shapes. Key concepts include: (1) Cross-section problems where volume equals the area of cross-section multiplied by length, (2) Water flow problems where volume equals cross-sectional area multiplied by speed and time, (3) Conversion between different units of measurement for area and volume, and (4) Problems involving multiple shapes such as cutting, melting, and recasting solids. These problems require identifying the appropriate shapes, applying relevant formulas, and performing unit conversions when necessary.",

      "explanation_incorrect": "The incorrect options B) 512 m³, C) 5000 m³, and D) 60000 m³ are not correct because they do not correctly apply the formula for volume, which is the cross-sectional area multiplied by the length.

When a solid metal sphere is melted and recast into 27 smaller spheres, the volume of the original sphere is distributed equally among the 27 smaller spheres.

The key is to recognize that the volume of the original sphere is distributed equally among the 27 smaller spheres.

The cross-sectional area of the rectangular channel is 2 m x 0.5 m = 1 m², and with a speed of 4 m/s, the volume of water flowing per second is 1 m² x 4 m/s = 4 m³.",

This is calculated by finding the volume of water flowing through the circular pipe per second, and then multiplying it by the number of seconds in 10 minutes. The volume per second is calculated as the cross-sectional area of the pipe (πr^2) multiplied by the flow speed (2 m/s), which gives us 3.08 litres per second. Multiplying this by the number of seconds in 10 minutes (600) gives us the total volume of 3696 litres.",

Option B) 36960 litres is too high because it does not account for the conversion from m^3/s to litres.

      "explanation_correct": "The correct answer is A) 10 hours. To find this, we need to calculate the total volume of water in the tank, which is the base area (15 m²) multiplied by the height (1.2 m), giving 18 m³. Since the water is being pumped out at 30 litres per minute, it will take 10 hours to empty the 18,000 litres (18 m³) in the tank completely.",

For example, B) 6 hours is incorrect because the tank contains 18,000 litres of water, and at a pumping rate of 30 litres per minute, it would take 10 hours to empty the tank, not 6 hours."

      "explanation_correct": "The correct answer is A) 56.25 cm. The volume of water flowing into the tank in 30 minutes is equal to the cross-sectional area of the pipe multiplied by the speed and time. Since the pipe has a diameter of 2 cm, the cross-sectional area is π × (1 cm)² = π cm². With a flow rate of 1 m/s and 30 minutes, the total volume of water is π × 1 m/s × (30 × 60 s) = 1800π liters, which corresponds to 56.25 cm of water level rise in the tank with a 40 cm radius.",

The correct height of the water in the cylindrical vessel is 13.5 cm, which can be calculated by setting the volume of the hemisphere equal to the volume of the cylinder and solving for the height."
