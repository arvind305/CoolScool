    "text": "Trigonometric ratios are relationships between the sides of a right-angled triangle. For an acute angle θ in a right triangle, the six trigonometric ratios are: sin θ = opposite/hypotenuse, cos θ = adjacent/hypotenuse, tan θ = opposite/adjacent, cosec θ = hypotenuse/opposite, sec θ = hypotenuse/adjacent, and cot θ = adjacent/opposite. These ratios have specific relationships: tan θ = sin θ/cos θ, cot θ = 1/tan θ, cosec θ = 1/sin θ, and sec θ = 1/cos θ. For standard angles (0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°), these ratios have specific values that are fundamental to solving trigonometric problems.",

In this case, the perpendicular is 7 cm and the hypotenuse can be calculated using Pythagoras theorem as the square root of (7^2 + 24^2), which is 25 cm. Therefore, the value of sin θ is 7/25.",

The correct value is 7/25, as sin θ is the ratio of the opposite side (perpendicular) to the hypotenuse, which is the square root of (7^2 + 24^2) = 25 cm."
