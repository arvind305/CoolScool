    "text": "Heights and Distances is an application of trigonometry to solve real-world problems involving right triangles. The angle of elevation is the angle formed between the horizontal line and the line of sight when looking upward at an object. The angle of depression is the angle formed between the horizontal line and the line of sight when looking downward at an object. These problems typically involve finding unknown heights or distances using trigonometric ratios (sin, cos, tan) and standard angle values (0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°).",

      "Use tan θ = perpendicular/base for height and distance problems",

The reason for this is that the tangent ratio (tan θ) gives the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side of a right-angled triangle.
