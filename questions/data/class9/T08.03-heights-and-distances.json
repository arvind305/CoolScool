    "text": "Heights and Distances is an application of trigonometry to solve real-world problems involving right triangles. The angle of elevation is the angle formed between the horizontal line and the line of sight when looking upward at an object. The angle of depression is the angle formed between the horizontal line and the line of sight when looking downward at an object. These problems typically involve finding unknown heights or distances using trigonometric ratios (sin, cos, tan) and standard angle values (0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°).",
    "rules": [
      "The angle of elevation is measured upward from the horizontal",
      "The angle of depression is measured downward from the horizontal",
      "Angle of elevation from point A to B equals angle of depression from point B to A (alternate angles)",
      "Use tan θ = perpendicular/base for height and distance problems",
      "Use sin θ = perpendicular/hypotenuse and cos θ = base/hypotenuse when dealing with slant distances",
      "Standard values: sin 30° = 1/2, cos 30° = √3/2, tan 30° = 1/√3, sin 45° = 1/√2, cos 45° = 1/√2, tan 45° = 1, sin 60° = √3/2, cos 60° = 1/2, tan 60° = √3"
