    "text": "The Cartesian plane is a two-dimensional coordinate system where any point can be represented by an ordered pair (x, y). The x-coordinate represents horizontal distance from the origin, and the y-coordinate represents vertical distance. The distance formula d = √[(x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²] calculates the distance between two points. The section formula for internal division gives the coordinates of a point dividing a line segment in a given ratio. The mid-point formula is (x₁+x₂)/2, (y₁+y₂)/2. Linear equations in two variables can be represented as straight lines on the Cartesian plane, with the slope-intercept form y = mx + c where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept.",

      "The Cartesian plane has four quadrants with different sign conventions",
      "Distance is always positive or zero",

However, the given points form an equilateral triangle, where all sides are equal in length."

      "explanation_incorrect": "The three points are not collinear, which means they do not lie on the same straight line. They form a triangle, which can be either right, scalene, or equilateral. Since the distances between the points are not equal, the triangle is a scalene triangle, not an equilateral triangle."

An equilateral triangle has all sides of equal length, a scalene triangle has all sides of different lengths, and a right triangle has one angle that is 90 degrees. In this case, the three points are collinear, meaning they lie on the same straight line, so they do not form any of these triangle types."
